          <div class="email-content">I find that cubes that I find at a store in my town tend to suck, 
while cubes I hear about people buying in their town work amazingly. 
My solution is to buy one over the net. Try Rubiks.com, or if you&#x27;re 
willing to spend a few extra bucks for a great one, buy a studio cube 
at Ton&#x27;s site: speedcubing.com/ton

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ramon:
 
I have had experience with these myself.  &#x27;Stretching the springs is not even necessary.  I have gone through about 5 of these when I was just practicing as a beginner (poured hours in them).  It&#x27;s REALLY terrible when you first buy them (well, most of them are, but some can be considerably well), but if they&#x27;re just for practice and no speed then they&#x27;re okay.  If you load some vaseline in one and wear it down for about a week, then i find mine okay (i have one with vaseline i can get under 30 secs easy).  They do break very easily, and yes, they are cheap, but they&#x27;re not that bad:)

I&#x27;ve lubed it, and it actually turns now, but unless it&#x27;s lined up

there are any).

In any case, the stickers are just really stupid, and hard to see

The good news is it came with a miniature &quot;keychain&quot; Magic Cube, 
which is the SECOND most horribly constructed mathematical shape ever

If anybody has any experience with these that doesn&#x27;t involve pelting 
them into the concrete in slow-turning-frustration, I&#x27;m open to ideas.

          <div class="email-content">I use those az interior cubes in my designs. I do this for economy.  
They ARE cheap. But as design cubes? Forget it. I much prefer the 
colors on ordinary cubes. You will see that in Toronto.

I am not rich and cannot afford not to practise economy. I acquired 
those cubes over the years. I would like more, to construct Landry 
Staircase made of 125 blcks with 8 cubes/block requires 1000 cubes. 
For a third iteration Menger Sponge I would need 729 cubes. Etc, 
etc.... I  would not be expected to keep those cubes, but return them 
with a design twiddled on them. :-)

If the anything that drives me crazy it&#x27;s a bad cube. I just solved <br>
a couple of new rubik&#x27;s cubes for my friend. Turning the thing <br>
almost drove me mad! and my hand hurt after I was done. My old cube <br>
(which I have gotten quite attacehd to) is just about dead and pops <br>
every couple of solves so it&#x27;s time to get another cube. I was <br>
wondering what kind of cube you people use and what you would <br>
recommend. Is it worth spending a lot of money on an old Hungarian <br>
cube from Ebay or will a new oddzon cube work well with a little <br>
work? How about a studio cube? Any opinions would be appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I can personally vouch for the &quot;magic cube&quot; with the glittery <br>
stickers. This was my origional cube. I poured tons of vasoline on <br>
it. And dropped my time down from about 2:30 seconds to 1:45 seconds. <br>
I used it for the next couple of weeks and you will come to realize <br>
that it will get vveerrry loose. You&#x27;re subconcious is constantly <br>
adjusting to the ammount of preassure applied for a quarter turn. The <br>
only real problem that I noticed was that it locked up bad... a lot. <br>
But if you could learn to adjust and know exactly when to turn it, it <br>
turns very fast. I was able to get a face about 7/8 of the way around <br>
by just using a quick flick of the finger. My fastest time on that <br>
cube, which is still my current record was 45 seconds. I&#x27;m in the <br>
long process of learning the F2L, orientations, and premutations so <br>
that record has been a month or so ago. Anyway just a few days ago I <br>
came to senses that it is... in fact, a cheap cube. While applying a <br>
trigger (R U&#x27;) the cube locked, flew out of my hand and gracefully <br>
smashed into the floor. One of the centers broke off and rendered the <br>
cube useless. I still haven&#x27;t bought a nice cube but I could safely <br>
say that it is a good beginer to intermediate cube. It&#x27;s very good to <br>
teach you to align correctly. It&#x27;s not the worst cube and you should <br>
by no means discard it. Hope this long winded explination helps :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">   The new cubes from Rubik.com are made of pretty smooth plastic, but<br>
have no adjusting screws. They come pretty tight and speed up when<br>
lubed. The white plastic versions offered occasionally on ebay, with<br>
vinyl stickers are set up a tad looser and feel pretty good. I find<br>
them tiring to work as I am pretty spoiled.<br>
<br>
   Except for the Rubik&#x27;s Studio Cubes I don&#x27;t know of any that are<br>
made today with the adjustable screws. I&#x27;ve heard horror stories about<br>
the stickers on *all* new cubes.<br>
<br>
   You can order Studio cubes at Ton&#x27;s site. He likes them fine.<br>
<br>
   I use the 20 year old Deluxe cubes, which come with plastic tiles,<br>
both the regular and the Rubiks Game versions which has little peg<br>
holes. They are adjustable and made of harder plastic than other<br>
cubes. They&#x27;re a little heavier, too so they&#x27;re not for everyone. I<br>
use Armorall and 3M silicone lube (the non oil-based kind) and the<br>
cubes are very fast, rarely lock up and almost never pop.<br>
<br>
   The older cubes (authentic Rubik&#x27;s not counterfeits) which have the<br>
adjustable screws were made in Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Hungary, and<br>
I think, England. People have made speed cubes out of all of these.<br>
<br>
   It comes down to a matter of taste I think. There are good older<br>
cubes on ebay, but don&#x27;t pay through the nose. Look at what they&#x27;ve<br>
gone for during the last few months, and bid judiciously. There were<br>
*hundreds of millions* of cubes made, so there are still lots of good<br>
unopened Ideal cubes out there. Be patient and you might get one for a<br>
good price.<br>

Shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising. Apparently Mr. Rubik invented the cube 
to illustrate group theory so it is quite natural to solve it using 
mathematics.

          <div class="email-content">I prefer the older cubes as well, but i wore outmy old on so i went 
out and got a bunch of rubiks.com/hessport cubes and after months of 
turning and lubing, it is an awesome cube.  The adjustable centers 
would be nice, so i will hopefully be getting a studio cube as well.  
One cheep knock of brand that was fairly decent for me at least were 
the WONDERFUL PUZZLER in the black boxes, the ones in the blue boxes 
really suck, I mean REALLY suck, probably the worst cubes ever made, 
unless i got some factory rejects or somethin :)

          <div class="email-content">Ok, so i ran the gauntlet today since I finally got my pocket cube and my bart-head in the mail... Still waiting on my Pyraminx and Megaminx, but this was just a test run anyway :)<br>
<br>
I know I&#x27;m not the fastest puzzler around, far from it, but I&#x27;m proud of my time, I solved (in this order):<br>
Bart&#x27;s head 2x2x2<br>
Homer&#x27;s Head 2x2x2<br>
15 puzzle<br>
5x5x5<br>
4x4x4<br>
3x3x3<br>
3x3x3<br>
3x3x3 miniature<br>
3x3x3 Texture cube, without looking<br>
2x2x2<br>
square-1<br>
<br>
that&#x27;s 11 puzzles in a row with no breaks in between (save when my screen saver came on while solving the texture cube and I had to type in my password, timer kept running though).<br>
<br>
All eleven in a row took 21:39.30  Just under 2 minutes per puzzle on average.  Not bad for a first try I think.  I know some others could do better thouhg.<br>
<br>
But I got to thinking, what about having a Magic-Cub-a-thon section on www.speedcubing.com  in which one would have to solve:<br>
5x5x5<br>
4x4x4<br>
3x3x3<br>
2x2x2<br>
In whatever order they wish, all in a row?  that might be a fun challenge.  Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
I LOVE my pocket cube btw :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well I got it just 2 or 3 days ago in the mail, and the only modification I&#x27;ve made is to spritz some silicon lubricant into it.  It turns super smooth, but I do get &quot;stuffed&quot; occaisionally.  I do have a bit of fear about it popping apart from all the horror stories I&#x27;ve heard, but it seems solid enough to not give too much thought too just yet.  I got it from hesseports rubiks shop btw.  My records with the 2x2 so far are:  Best non-lucky time, 7.83 Best average 14.53.  I love it because it requires no thought :)<br>
<br>
Also, I tried the 2-3-4-5 challenge and got about 9:54, so I&#x27;m going to try to kick it up a notch first before I submit my time.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone. Just recently I&#x27;ve gotten back to the 4 dimentional <br>
cube trying to solve it again. Summer is just right around the <br>
corner and I was wondering if anyone, that seems to be at the stage <br>
I am at with solving it, wanted to exchange a few e-mails just to <br>
combine heads and try to maybe share credit of the 20th someodd <br>
people to solve it (if in fact we do). I would like it if you had at <br>
least looked at the puzzle and given it some thought. Again I don&#x27;t <br>
want someone who has already solved it. If you are interested please <br>
e-mail me at eagles10101@... thank you and have a great day!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know you guys will get it, probably pretty quickly.  When I tried it last 
October (I think), it only took a week of fiddling to get it solved.  My 
second try, I did it in four hours straight.  And I know that many of the 
puzzlers here are smarter than I.

Fourth dimensional theory has held a great fascination for me for quite some 
time... I don&#x27;t exactly clame to be an expert, just a little more 
knowledgable than someone who has never thought about it before :).  A few 
very good books on the subject:
Hyperspace, by Michio Kaku
Surfing through hyperspace, by Clifford A Pickover (the book I deam 
responsible for my obsession with the rubik&#x27;s cube, oddly enough)
Flatland, by Edwin Abbot Abbot
The Boy Who Reversed Himself, By William Sleator (the book responsible for 
my obsession with the 4th dimension).

The last two are story books, the last one of which is actually a children&#x27;s 
story book I read in 4th grade.  Ever since then I&#x27;ve read all things I 
could get my hands on about the fourth dimension.  Since then I&#x27;ve driven 
geometry and calculus teachers crazy in high school and vector calculus 
teachers to drink in college :-D.

At any rate, to answer the 4-D person in a 3-d jail thing:
  As is always the case when visualizing 4-d problems, take it down one 
dimension.  Draw a circle on a piece of paper, then draw a stick figure 
inside that circle.  You have a 2-d person in a 2-d jail.  As long as that 
stick figure is bound to the 2 dimensions of the paper (north-south, 
east-west), it cannot pass through the &quot;jail&quot; created by the circle.  Now 
place a physical small object inside the drawn circle.  If this physical 
small object (I&#x27;ll use a pocket cube ;) ) is confined to the 2-dimensions of 
the paper, it also cannot pass throught the &quot;jail.&quot;  However, since it is a 
three dimensional object, it is possible to lift it up into the third 
dimension, off the paper, move it over, and place it down again on the other 
side of the &quot;jail&quot; wall.  Simple enough, right?  Well  if we do the same 
thing with a 3d object in a 3d jail and a 4-d object in a 3-d jail, the same 
thing happens.  the 3-d object is bound to the 3 dimensions of our world: 
up-down, north-south, east-west.  The four dimensional object can however 
move in another direction &quot;over&quot; the 3-d jail wall, and re-enter the 3-d 
plane of existence on the other side of the cell.  My personal favorite 
description of this extra degree of freedom is &quot;ana-kata&quot;  which I first 
heard in _The Boy Who Reversed Himself_, though the terms were coined some 
time before that book was written.  That is not to say a 2-d object couldn&#x27;t 
escape a 2-d jail in the same manner if it could figure out a way to move in 
a 3-d direction, exactly as a 3-d object could escape a 3-d jail  if it 
could figure out how to move in a 4-d direction.

It may also help to remember that a direction that defines an n+1 
dimensional space is the direction that is orthoganol (perpendicular) to all 
directions in n-space.  In 1-D space (a line) a line orthoganol to that line 
will create 2-d Space.  In 2-D space, a line orhtoganol to 2 already 
orthoganol lines in 2-d space, will define 3-d space.  So in 3-d Space if 
you have 3 perpendicular lines (like the corner of a rubik&#x27;s cube) a line

          <div class="email-content">Hey Daniel:
 
Yes, I agree with Michio Kaku&#x27;s HYPERSPACE-  AN EXCELLENT BOOK.  Have you ever listened to that guy on Artbell?

I know you guys will get it, probably pretty quickly.  When I tried it last 
October (I think), it only took a week of fiddling to get it solved.  My 
second try, I did it in four hours straight.  And I know that many of the 
puzzlers here are smarter than I.

Fourth dimensional theory has held a great fascination for me for quite some 
time... I don&#x27;t exactly clame to be an expert, just a little more 
knowledgable than someone who has never thought about it before :).  A few 
very good books on the subject:
Hyperspace, by Michio Kaku
Surfing through hyperspace, by Clifford A Pickover (the book I deam 
responsible for my obsession with the rubik&#x27;s cube, oddly enough)
Flatland, by Edwin Abbot Abbot
The Boy Who Reversed Himself, By William Sleator (the book responsible for 
my obsession with the 4th dimension).

The last two are story books, the last one of which is actually a children&#x27;s 
story book I read in 4th grade.  Ever since then I&#x27;ve read all things I 
could get my hands on about the fourth dimension.  Since then I&#x27;ve driven 
geometry and calculus teachers crazy in high school and vector calculus 
teachers to drink in college :-D.

At any rate, to answer the 4-D person in a 3-d jail thing:
  As is always the case when visualizing 4-d problems, take it down one 
dimension.  Draw a circle on a piece of paper, then draw a stick figure 
inside that circle.  You have a 2-d person in a 2-d jail.  As long as that 
stick figure is bound to the 2 dimensions of the paper (north-south, 
east-west), it cannot pass through the &quot;jail&quot; created by the circle.  Now 
place a physical small object inside the drawn circle.  If this physical 
small object (I&#x27;ll use a pocket cube ;) ) is confined to the 2-dimensions of 
the paper, it also cannot pass throught the &quot;jail.&quot;  However, since it is a 
three dimensional object, it is possible to lift it up into the third 
dimension, off the paper, move it over, and place it down again on the other 
side of the &quot;jail&quot; wall.  Simple enough, right?  Well  if we do the same 
thing with a 3d object in a 3d jail and a 4-d object in a 3-d jail, the same 
thing happens.  the 3-d object is bound to the 3 dimensions of our world: 
up-down, north-south, east-west.  The four dimensional object can however 
move in another direction &quot;over&quot; the 3-d jail wall, and re-enter the 3-d 
plane of existence on the other side of the cell.  My personal favorite 
description of this extra degree of freedom is &quot;ana-kata&quot;  which I first 
heard in _The Boy Who Reversed Himself_, though the terms were coined some 
time before that book was written.  That is not to say a 2-d object couldn&#x27;t 
escape a 2-d jail in the same manner if it could figure out a way to move in 
a 3-d direction, exactly as a 3-d object could escape a 3-d jail  if it 
could figure out how to move in a 4-d direction.

It may also help to remember that a direction that defines an n+1 
dimensional space is the direction that is orthoganol (perpendicular) to all 
directions in n-space.  In 1-D space (a line) a line orthoganol to that line 
will create 2-d Space.  In 2-D space, a line orhtoganol to 2 already 
orthoganol lines in 2-d space, will define 3-d space.  So in 3-d Space if 
you have 3 perpendicular lines (like the corner of a rubik&#x27;s cube) a line 
that is orhtoganol to all three of those lines simultaneously, will create 
4-d space.  If you figure out how to point to this line, please show me.

Hope that helps!  And good luck on the 4-D Cube!!!  You can do it!

For last week&#x27;s scramble, I decided to see how Cube Explorer would solve it. I gave the program about 10 minutes to solve it. Here was last weeks scramble:<br>
<br>
B&#x27; F&#x27; U R2 U2 R&#x27; F2 B&#x27; D U2 R&#x27; U D B2 F&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; L2 U R2 B&#x27; L2 B&#x27; U B<br>
<br>
Here is Cube Explorer&#x27;s solution (19 moves):<br>
<br>
D2 F D R&#x27; F2 U2 L2 F&#x27; B&#x27; R U L2 U&#x27; L&#x27; R2 B2 U2 D2 R2<br>
<br>
My soltion was 50 moves :) See how I solved it on Dan&#x27;s site if you want.. e-mail me if anyone wants to show how I could improve on that solution (since I have just started a fewest moves solving.. any help would be nice!!!)<br>

          <div class="email-content">There are all sorts of different color orientations. Usually the 
uncommon ones like you described are just made cheaply from some 
place. The real ones, of course, are yellow-white/blue-green/ornage-
red.
A friend of mine has a cube that has purple and pink, and all the 
other normal colors are really neon-y. It&#x27;s a pretty good speedcube, 
too.

It ius insane to suppose that a cube with &quot;original&quot; color scheme ius

The color scheme you describe is the original Rubik&#x27;s color scheme. 
With all due  respect to Mr.Rubik, I prefer the scheme with highest 
contrast. The problem with Rubik&#x27;s scheme is that it has two opposite 
light colors (white/yrllow) and two opposite dark colors 
(green/blue). Such colorcombination photograph rather poorly, 
particularly with a lousy camera used by a lousy photograoher (me :-
) ).

          <div class="email-content">Hey, Brent,
Dan Gosbee and I never discussed the possibility oif my designs being 
included in the Guinness&#x27;s Book of World Records. That is up to 
Guinness, not Dan. What I  did learn is that evidently no one except 
myself is exhibiting in the cube art category. After an extensive 
search I am unable to find anyone on the web who does what I do. I 
was hoping to find some 3d designers in Toronto, but it looks as if 
no one comes forward even here. :-(( I did write to one of the 2d 
designers, but he declined coming to Toronto.
The website  to look at for pictures of my designs is 
http://cube.misto.cz . It is an English-Czech site. My nationality is 
Czech, same as Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s. :-) You can find this site among 
the links to speedcubing.com .I have no site devoted specifically to 
the patterns, but you can find that n Chapter 4 of my book.
I have no &quot;physics of the Rubik&#x27;s cube&quot; site. All I can say is that 
luricating the cube is good for speedcubing, but make sure it doesn&#x27;t 
get too loose so it falls apart.In Toronto, that could do you in.

Hi Brent,

   It may. Is this what you&#x27;re talking about?
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2011%20Ideal%20US%20red%20next%20to%20organe%201980.htm
   This was a rare variation that appears once in awhile on ebay.

   Most of the cubes made by Ideal for the US and Britain were
Red/Orange - Blue/White - Green/Yellow. One corner was the primary
colors Red Blue and Green clockwise. This is the color scheme seen on
the cylindrical cardboard container used primarily in Britain. There
were some variations made and the odd mistake made.  At one point this
became the defacto &quot;official&quot; colors for they then used this color
scheme for the Deluxe and Rubik&#x27;s Game Deluxe with tiles which are
more permanent than stickers. In addition they addressed the contrast
problem and Green is much lighter and brighter than Blue.

   The genuine cubes in Continental Europe had a different color
scheme. This was Orange/Red - Yellow/white - Blue/Green with one
corner reading Red - White - Green clockwise. But soon errors crept in
and though the European cube remained Orange/Red - Yellow/white -
Blue/Green the Orange and Red sides were switched and then the cube
read Red - Green - White clockwise.

   I don&#x27;t know why, since they solved the problem once, they recently
reverted to this last color scheme which they declared as the new
&quot;Official&quot; scheme. But they stayed with the sticker colors which have
the contrast problem.

is that maybe your megaminx might have popped and you put in the edge

little old, it&#x27;ll still help to relive a little summer boredom for <br>
all of you who still go to school. Anyway here you go: using the &quot;A&quot; <br>
premutation compleatly scramble the cube. Try to fully scramble the 8 <br>
corners so that no stickers are facing toward their side. To put it <br>
more simpily, the corner pieces can&#x27;t be the same color as the edge <br>
pieces on all 6 sides (and those corners do not need to be the same <br>
color). I&#x27;m pretty sure it can be done using a corners first method <br>
or something similar... that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying do it using the &quot;A&quot;pre-<br>
mutation :-) reamember the corners do not need to be in any kind of <br>
order. Have a great day/night/evening/morning/mid-day (depending on <br>

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Daniel Hayes&quot; &lt;swedishlf@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Thu, 29 May 2003 21:00:51 +0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hey all, my Megaminx and Pyraminx came in today, I was way excited.  Ordered <br>
them both from mefferts, despite my previous experience with <br>
less-than-wonderful service.<br>
<br>
The first time I ordered from them, it was a 5x5x5, a 4x4x4 and a square-1.  <br>
The 5x5x5 that showed up was the wrong color scheme, so after a little <br>
prodding I got them to send a replacement.  The replacement showed up and it <br>
was the right color scheme, but it would fall apart after about 10 twists.  <br>
So I kept the one with the incorrect color scheme (which functions very <br>
well)  and retiled it myself.  Sent the other one back to him after I <br>
reassembled it.<br>
<br>
So I was a bit timid.<br>
<br>
But today when I got my megaminx (which is considerably smaller than I <br>
expected), 3 of the stickers had fallen off.  This was kind of ok since I <br>
wanted to redo it to a 12 color version, the one I got was only 6.  But the <br>
kicker was that one of the edge pieces was actually glued to one of the <br>
center pieces.  This made any turn that tried to separate those two pieces <br>
completely impossible, which turned out to be more annoying than you might <br>
expect.  So I eventually got them separated using a very sharp pocket knife. <br>
  But I don&#x27;t feel that that is something the end user should have to do.<br>
<br>
As for the Pyraminx, I&#x27;m going to need some help.  I solved it once after my <br>
girlfriend scrambled it for me, took a bit, but I got the hang of it after <br>
maybe 5 or so minutes.  Then she was scrambling it again and it burst to <br>
pieces.  3 of the pyramid points are still firmly connected to the central <br>
ball.  On of the points has however, come off.  This in turn made the center <br>
piece of the second layer fall off by nature of construction, which made 3 <br>
of the edge pieces fall off.  So if the pyraminx is supposed to look like <br>
this:<br>
  /\<br>
/\/\<br>
/\/\/\<br>
<br>
It looks like this:<br>
/\/\/\<br>
<br>
with various other pieces laying about.  Now I have figured out how it&#x27;s <br>
supposed to go together, the problem is, getting it back together.  The <br>
construction is a ball with 4 screw holes in in.  Each of the 4 peak pieces <br>
has a screw coming out the bottom with the screw head imbedded in the peak <br>
puzzle piece.  the screw threads goe through the &quot;middle&quot; piece (of which <br>
there are 3 on each side if that makes sense), and screws into the central <br>
ball.  The problem is this:  The Peak piece, which houses the screw head, <br>
turns independantly of the screw itself.  So there is no way to assemble the <br>
puzzle, 100% and screw the screw back in.  The way I see it, I have 3 <br>
options.  I can, drill a hole in the top of the peak piece, and try to <br>
tighten the screw while the puzzle is assembled with a screw driver through <br>
the hole (assuming this is a normal screw with a phillips or slot head, <br>
which is not certain).  I can try to pry off the bottom part of the peak, <br>
screw the puzzle back together, and glue the peak back onto its base (this <br>
is very similar to the way I assume the puzzle was first assembled).  Or I <br>
can simply drop some glue on the screw shaft, making it stick to the peak <br>
piece and use the puzzle piece itself as a screw head.  The problem with <br>
this is that it will make two pieces of the puzzle glued together.  Granted <br>
those two pieces are the peak piece and the only other piece it touches, so <br>
it&#x27;s not exactly a challenging part of the puzzle that I lose, but still, <br>
then it&#x27;s not a 100% functioning puzzle.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any ideas on how to reassemble a pyraminx, please please <br>
please let me know.  I can take pictures on sunday, maybe sooner, if anyone <br>
needs to see exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, because of my personal experience, and my personal <br>
oppinions on those experiences, it will be a long time before I order <br>
anything, or reccomend anyone else to order anything from www.mefferts.com.  <br>
Just my oppinion.  Btw, it took about an hour, but I did end up solving the <br>
megaminx, with no help from anyone :-D.<br>

specify things like: do not attach the tiles, they don&#x27;t comply. My 
Revenge broke the first month I got it (two of the centers snaped 
off). My Megaminx was ok after a couple hours of sanding, But during 
normal use edge tiles kept falling off. Eventually after most of 
them, and some corner ones, fell off and got reglued. I rarely ever 
touch the two tiled 3x3&#x27;s I got from them, because they have no 
springs, and after heavy use some of the little pink chunks came off 
inside the centers. The center caps themself fall off constantly 
until I glued them in. Also those holes are kinda unsightly.

-------------------------------------
Sorry, I knew I was going to have trouble explaining it. Ok first of 
all the &quot;A&quot; premutation is described on Jessica&#x27;s site but this is 
the algorythem (L F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; F L B2 L2). This should shuffle the BUL-
FUL and the BUR pieces. The second question is yes. You do not need 
to solve the cube again just try to have no corner sticker 
corresponding with an edge sticker (edge stickers should be the same 
on each face). After you&#x27;re done with that it might also be fun to 
solve it the same way :-). Hope this helps

You could take two pieces out and swap them without flipping them.

If your cube is really loose, you might be able to twist a single corner
in place without removing it.

You could take stickers off and put them back on in the wrong places.

You could scramble the cube and super-glue the pieces together so the
cube no longer turns.

Sure.  From a solved cube, execute these turns:  U2 D2 L2 R2 F2 B2

Here&#x27;s another challenge someone gave me that took a little bit of work:
try to arrange the cube so that no color appears on any face more than
twice.

          <div class="email-content">OK, here is a new discipline.<br>
<br>
Someone scrambles the cube for you and is allowed to remove pieces, <br>
too. Your task is to tell as fast as you can if the cube is solvable <br>
and if it is not, what is it that happened (i.e., one twisted corner, <br>
flipped edge, or swapped two cubies, or combinations of those). You <br>
can average 10 attempts, as with regular cube solving, and calculate <br>
average. If you guess wrong, it will be treated as a &quot;pop&quot; in <br>
calculating the average.<br>
<br>
What would be your strategy? What do you think is the fastest <br>
possible average for this?<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>
<br>
P.S.: On another thought, this would be really boring because you <br>
need to either have someone to mix the cube for you or disassemble it <br>
yourself and then assemble it randomly ... so you need some junk cube <br>
for this. But still, I am quite curious, for example, if there is a <br>
faster strategy than solving, say the F2L, and then telling, or <br>
simply quickly calculating some invariants right from the colved <br>
cube, ... any ideas?<br>

edge to indicate that the other face is white, and on the white face <br>
you paint a thin red stripe along the edge to indicate the other <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hihi,<br>
<br>
Check out the solutions to this weeks challenge, which are now online on my website at http://www.cubestation.co.uk !<br>
<br>
Now you can see at a glance how the competitors solve the cube, courtesy of Lars&#x27; java applet, and David Barr&#x27;s (www.oinkleburger.com) excellent move translator!<br>
<br>
There will be a new challenge launched at midnight, why not participate, it is an excellent exercise of your cubing skills!<br>
<br>
Best of Luck, DanH :)<br>

<br>
By the way, the FMC is a great exercise! It is fun and a good challenge. I find it more fun than speed cubing, but obviously more time consuming (I guess that is why they don&#x27;t call it speed-fewest moves challenge)<br>

Yes, that works.  Here&#x27;s another one I haven&#x27;t tried yet.  Try to get
every side to contain at least one square of every color.

          <em>Date:</em> Fri, 30 May 2003 19:03:39 +0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">I recently got a pyraminx and a megaminx from Mefferts, but the pyraminx <br>
fell apart after a single solve.  I&#x27;m looking for ideas on how to reassemble <br>
it, as I don&#x27;t want to wait for a replacement, due to past experience with <br>
mefferts (just my humble oppinion/preference).  So here&#x27;s an exerpt from my <br>
other thread, in case anyone who might be able to help me missed it:<br>
<br>
I solved it once after my<br>
girlfriend scrambled it for me, took a bit, but I got the hang of it after<br>
maybe 5 or so minutes.  Then she was scrambling it again and it burst to<br>
pieces.  3 of the pyramid points are still firmly connected to the central<br>
ball.  On of the points has however, come off.  This in turn made the center<br>
piece of the second layer fall off by nature of construction, which made 3<br>
of the edge pieces fall off.  So if the pyraminx is supposed to look like<br>
this:<br>
  /\<br>
/\/\<br>
/\/\/\<br>
<br>
It looks like this:<br>
/\/\/\<br>
<br>
with various other pieces laying about.  Now I have figured out how it&#x27;s<br>
supposed to go together, the problem is, getting it back together.  The<br>
construction is a ball with 4 screw holes in in.  Each of the 4 peak pieces<br>
has a screw coming out the bottom with the screw head imbedded in the peak<br>
puzzle piece.  the screw threads goe through the &quot;middle&quot; piece (of which<br>
there are 3 on each side if that makes sense), and screws into the central<br>
ball.  The problem is this:  The Peak piece, which houses the screw head,<br>
turns independantly of the screw itself.  So there is no way to assemble the<br>
puzzle, 100% and screw the screw back in.  The way I see it, I have 3<br>
options.  I can, drill a hole in the top of the peak piece, and try to<br>
tighten the screw while the puzzle is assembled with a screw driver through<br>
the hole (assuming this is a normal screw with a phillips or slot head,<br>
which is not certain).  I can try to pry off the bottom part of the peak,<br>
screw the puzzle back together, and glue the peak back onto its base (this<br>
is very similar to the way I assume the puzzle was first assembled).  Or I<br>
can simply drop some glue on the screw shaft, making it stick to the peak<br>
piece and use the puzzle piece itself as a screw head.  The problem with<br>
this is that it will make two pieces of the puzzle glued together.  Granted<br>
those two pieces are the peak piece and the only other piece it touches, so<br>
it&#x27;s not exactly a challenging part of the puzzle that I lose, but still,<br>
then it&#x27;s not a 100% functioning puzzle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help!<br>
<br>
BTW, I officially have formulated a solution to the megaminx.  I&#x27;ve solved <br>
it about 5 times with no problems.  And it is now a 12 color version :).  <br>
Gotta go time myself now!<br>

i once watched a friend play with my cube for the first time, and she 
thought that was the idea...which is funny for a few reasons.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jessica,

   Good question.

   I tried it, and I could only quickly tell if a corner had been
twisted or an edge flipped. In trying to determine whether two
corners/two edges had been swapped I ran into a problem regarding the
edges - &quot;one in/three out&quot; on the LL can look like &quot;two in/two out&quot;
with a quarter turn. I had to sort the LL corners, so even getting the
F2L solved didn&#x27;t help.

   I would guess that most would find the quickest way would be to
solve the cube.

   You can try it after a pop where you didn&#x27;t note where the popped
pieces had been and/or were facing. Or you could do it after cleaning
and lubing your cube, just put it back together unsolved.

   Thanks,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Like i replied before, you should probably try and pry the cap off so 
you can possibly save your whole puzzle without much outside damage.  
The only other way is sawing are drilling through that top peak so 
you can screw it down, but that would make the puzzle very 
unatractive.  I suggest trying the first way, and using a really 
sharp knife or a razor blade or something and try and pry through the 
seems of the peek.  the only other suggestions is to try a post on 
the twisty megasite forum where they deal more with puzzle building 
techniques.

          <div class="email-content">:P Thanks for the compliments... I&#x27;m really glad that people are enjoying the challenge I set up :)<br>
<br>
There was a problem with the java cubes... i had been very stupid hehe. They should work now, but if there is still a problem for anyone, please let me know @ cubestation@... :D<br>

  I am not sure if it is just me, but the Java applet will not load for me :( I would REALLY love to see it. Neat idea, Mr. Harris! Maybe I can see it soon :-p<br>
<br>
  By the way, the FMC is a great exercise! It is fun and a good challenge. I find it more fun than speed cubing, but obviously more time consuming (I guess that is why they don&#x27;t call it speed-fewest moves challenge)<br>

          <div class="email-content">It works now. I am glad, too. It is easier for me to go through other&#x27;s solutions with the applet than do it on my own cube because I tend to forget what move I need to do next. This way, I can go along with the applet. It is ammusing to see my solution in Java applet form :) I just love it. I cannot wait for the next challenge. I do need to learn more algorithms though...<br>

Very nice time!  4 moves for the 2x2x2 isnt all that lucky.  I&#x27;d say 
since you have learned algs to be able to solve the LL in one step 
then you should be able to count that as a non lucky time. way to go.
theres my take on the situation.

          <div class="email-content">I too recently bought a magaminx from mefferts. It did seem a little <br>
small. The quality was horrible. Many stickers fell off and I wasn&#x27;t <br>
too happy with the bright pink and 2 shades of orange. What&#x27;s up <br>
with that? I could barely turn it. After some lubing and sanding, it <br>
turned okay but exploded on every turn. I found out this was due to <br>
a loose screw. One of the center caps actually fell off but the one <br>
over the screw that I needed to tighten almost broke when I tried to <br>
pry it off I mow can&#x27;t get the cap to stay back in. It&#x27;s not worth <br>
it in my opinion. The old Hungarian Supernova looks better. I like <br>
the fact that the corners are thicker and the edged com more to a <br>
point. It seems easier to turn. How&#x27;s the quality?<br>
<br>
--The constantly barefoot ©H®Ï§<br>
<br>
 <br>
&gt; But today when I got my megaminx (which is considerably smaller <br>
than I <br>
&gt; expected), 3 of the stickers had fallen off.  This was kind of ok <br>
since I <br>
&gt; wanted to redo it to a 12 color version, the one I got was only <br>
6.  But the <br>
&gt; kicker was that one of the edge pieces was actually glued to one <br>
of the <br>
&gt; center pieces.  This made any turn that tried to separate those <br>
two pieces <br>
&gt; completely impossible, which turned out to be more annoying than <br>
you might <br>
&gt; expect.  So I eventually got them separated using a very sharp <br>
pocket knife. <br>
&gt;   But I don&#x27;t feel that that is something the end user should have <br>
to do.<br>

Thanks. Ok great, but since people have different opinions on what 
is and isn&#x27;t a lucky time I&#x27;d appriciate more opinions from others. 
I decided that those estimates seemed iffy and decided to do 50 
consecutive solves to determine some more accurate numbers. I think 
it would also be nice to have other people post some of their 
interesting statistics here. Especially that of the people in the 
top 10. For example, I remember reading somewhere that Jessica 
employed over 100 algs in her prime. And Gosbee&#x27;s secret system has 
over 300 algs. Speaking of which there is probably no consensus on 
how to count algs. For example on Lar&#x27;s site inverses are usually 
shown separatly and in the Fridrich system some people not count the 
c/e insertion sequences as algs. Speaking of which, although I don&#x27;t 
use the Fridrich system competitively I&#x27;ve rarely ever encountered a 
situation that took longer then 7 turns to do the cross in face 
metric.
In my usage the term algorithm will denote a sequence of moves >=6 
turns but with in a reasonable length that&#x27;s end effect only changes 
one layer AND not counting mirrors, inverses, or mirrored-inveres as 
different. (In gerneral, I would find it perfectly fine to call one 
turn an alg but it is not a big deal to say you memorized trivial 
stuff like: U,U2,U&#x27;... referring to a disagreement I saw in a post 
last week.) So I realized I was exagerating earlier when I said I 
knew more then 120 algs. I think more than 90 now, realizing that 
even the OLL/PLL requires precisely 53 algs, but my number will 
raise in the comming days.

Ok so out of 50 consecutive solves today here are some of my 
interesting stats:
But first I should clearify somethings. This is not OLL/PLL btw, 
even thought I sometimes apply those algs. Hehe, I guess this way I 
can count it non-lucky when OLL stage is skipped because I follow 
tighter with CLL/ELL. Some of these stats will look wrong due to 
occassional preprocessing during F2L. Speaking of which I do not 
usually use the Fridrich F2L, but do when I see that it is possible 
to do so in >=4 turns or there&#x27;s an Extended Cross easily 
attainable. The edges were orientated correctly 13/50 which is about 
double what is normal. 12% the corners were placed correctly 
relative to each other, less then the usual 17%. I was doing 4% 
during the first half of the session, with I found strange. This 
might have affected my overall stats since it is in these 1/6 that I 
am more likely to solve in one look/alg. Similarly, only 12% were of 
Diagonaly Swapped corners.
So I categorized each solve into three groups: Bad, Easy, and 1-
Look. These had 30%, 62%, and 8% respectively. I define Easy in the 
following manner: all corners are orientated and placed AND the 
edges are in a simple arrangment requiring about 7 moves in slice 
metric and less then 2.5s, 3.2 for the &quot;Z&quot;. Simple edge cases 
include, but are not limited to The &quot;Z&quot; permutation, &quot;+&quot; 
permutation, and Allan. To maintain consistancy in these LL 
statistics I limited myself to solving the F2L not too fast or too 
slow since I would then do more or less pre-processing. The majority 
of F2Ls were kept 11-16s with a median at about 15. A few F2Ls less 
then 10s were disregarded since it meant I was greedy and just 
wanted to finish the F2L quick and leave myself with a crappy LL. 
The LL execution was also timed... summing with the F2L and 
compensating for inspection pause most of these were my natural sub-
25 solves.

I hope you find this type of stuff interesting, feel free to e-mail 
me with any questions. Oh and I do have all 50 encountered LL 
senerios well documented. Kinda rough doing 50 solves a day when I 
already probably did over 100 earlier. So I&#x27;m still pondering the 
question of wheather my 12.26 solves was lucky. There&#x27;s another 
supporting detail that it is not: I did another sub-13 later today! 
But that one was probably lucky.

Yes, this is cheating. With a lot of practice it may help you get better times.
There will be a rule against this or other puzzle enhancements.

It would be much cooler if you would be able to predict/know what color is on
the back side of a cubie. Try it! Especially during F2L it is very possible and
useful.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Not to my knowledge. I do believe the closest was Robert Pergl with 
about half of them. As for recgonition it would be differetn for 
different people. I found that I was able to recognize Corner cases 
in a split second, often I would forget or never fully regester 
which I was doing, I would just start doing them while whatching 
edge movement. Many times I&#x27;d know what to expect from none flipped, 
all flipped, and two flipped. So I felt that this would be a natural 
progression for me and I have been working on it for the past couple 
months, but I have planned for it over a year ago. I don&#x27;t get good 
speed on the CLL thought, and probably don&#x27;t execute the CLL too 
fast either. I timed my LL&#x27;s to be 9 seconds factoring for pauses. 
But I have got my 13s F2L down and sometimes do it in under 10s. So 
with some more practice I should be ready for the Competition.

I posted this puzzle on the club on december 9, 2000. Unfortunately we lost the
archive.

Katsu and Kondo were the first to post a solution.

<br>
&gt; &gt; Someone scrambles the cube for you and is allowed to remove pieces,<br>
&gt; &gt; too. Your task is to tell as fast as you can if the cube is solvable<br>
&gt; &gt; and if it is not, what is it that happened (i.e., one twisted corner,<br>
&gt; &gt; flipped edge, or swapped two cubies, or combinations of those). You<br>
&gt; &gt; can average 10 attempts, as with regular cube solving, and calculate<br>
&gt; &gt; average. If you guess wrong, it will be treated as a &quot;pop&quot; in<br>
&gt; &gt; calculating the average.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; What would be your strategy? What do you think is the fastest<br>
&gt; &gt; possible average for this?<br>
Corner orientation: 2 seconds.<br>
Edge orientation: 4 seconds. (Recognition would be easier by always starting<br>
from the same angle.)<br>
Total permutation: 15 seconds by counting the number of swaps. But maybe the<br>
blindfold guys can do this faster.<br>

That test had so many questions about Hobbits and Lord of the Rings. 
They should have had more on Harry Potter, which is the best book 
ever written in the entire world.
There is a nerdity test at www.nerdparadise.com. I took it once, but 
I forgot my score.

the other day i was just mixing the cube, not paying attention to any <br>

it...no goal in mind.<br>
<br>
well, after awhile i just stopped turning and when i looked at the <br>
cube, the center slice was solved all the way around. so i started to <br>
wonder if this happens to anyone else...if other&#x27;s have noticed <br>
certain patterns occuring after random mixes. i know it happens all <br>

This IQ test is bullshit, the average oyster would get >150 points.
Anyway, it has nothing to do with cubing.

Yes, I also had the same thoughts of the Cube series: they were a waste of time, yet they were still good.  Though they are not the &#x27;best&#x27; movies I have ever seen, they are considered classics.  Cube 2 Hyperspace had an excellent story line, and yes, I agree with you Jake: awesome, yet not the best...

the first one, the initial reaction was, &quot;that movie was a total

So your first 25 are correct. My friend knows about 70, and a math 
teacher at my school knows about 250. I ought to learn more, but I&#x27;m 
too lazy and my memory is bad.
How many does Richard Carr know? He&#x27;s the blindfold cubing master, 
right? He must know about a billion, then.

  the other day i was just mixing the cube, not paying attention to any <br>
  turns....just turning for the sake of having it my hands and turning <br>
  it...no goal in mind.<br>
<br>
  well, after awhile i just stopped turning and when i looked at the <br>
  cube, the center slice was solved all the way around. so i started to <br>
  wonder if this happens to anyone else...if other&#x27;s have noticed <br>
  certain patterns occuring after random mixes. i know it happens all <br>
  the time with shuffled decks of cards, so why not the cube...<br>

  Yeah thats the right stuff.  A while back I learned all the way to 
  314 decimal places, now i remember around the first 100

<br>
It is so fast to solve a 2x2x2 cube to solved it with or without <br>
inspection. The fastest persons will tell you that it is twice <br>
longer by the chronometer.<br>
<br>
Several people believe that the two-step corner method is faster.<br>
<br>
Putting 3 exact corners around the 4th corner to complete one layer. <br>
<br>
I have 3 steps, but my first step is faster. I direct the 8 corners <br>
right from the beginning  to a precise and frequent. The method <br>
opens up on a second step which is simple and super fast. I am <br>
certain I can achieve it faster in 3 steps.<br>
<br>
It is absolutly certain that there is only one other method that can <br>
equal it: true or false?  Without having practiced.<br>
<br>
Using the same amount of moves besides, I have fewer algorythms to <br>
memoryse. <br>
<br>
Dan Gosbee the fastest rubik&#x27;s cube?<br>
<br>
I was not present at the October 6 CUBE DAY, but my inquires lead me <br>
to believe that none of the cube expert who attended was able to <br>
solve in less that 30 seconds,   <br>
<br>
Why do you keep your method secret? You say that the chairperson <br>
connot participate. Well then, why not deliver it on the web?  16.89 <br>
average ! <br>
<br>
The group set the championship to Toronto. I already had picture of <br>
rubik&#x27;cube competition Toronto on my web site. I don&#x27;t no but funny <br>
for me. I&#x27;m the fisrt &amp; last cubist with the blindfull+behind <br>
back+fast TV &amp; public,  Magic or not !  The rubik&#x27;s cube is the <br>
magic cube! <br>
<br>
http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/video3.wmv <br>
<br>
Toronto is no far for me. I&#x27;m ready! <br>
<br>
It is important to be most quickly to be the best?. Thai, petrus is<br>
very good to and more cubists. Korf is the first man with program <br>
algorythms god. I&#x27; m not the fastest with the rubik&#x27; s cube <br>
popular.  <br>
<br>
I figured myself driving in a limousine, winning trips &amp; money. I&#x27;m <br>
not one star. My name is not Michael Jackson.<br>
<br>
I had a madman&#x27;s record. I want to count numbers randomly ( at <br>
random) while solving my cube.  scrambled my cube and give me the <br>
numbers.  Ex:  329 X 258= 84882 yes I am and no cheat and fast, <br>
about 30 seconds.  I&#x27;m ready at the championsip 2003. Anticipe a <br>
long time ago this record for the moment at the championsip.  <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t like robot translations. I had to find a friend who would <br>
write this for me. In the forum,  I would like to be less limited.  <br>
It seems that everything will happen during the tournament but no <br>
french cubists guys(speak english).  Ron seems to be the only one, <br>
he speak french. I wouldn&#x27;t want to impose to much on him. I would <br>
like to share something more than a hand-shake.  I fear I&#x27;ll be to <br>
lonely in my corner.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m new to this group, but i&#x27;ve been following the speedcube community for a<br>
while.<br>
<br>
I enjoy looking at the best scores on the &quot;Unofficial World Records&quot; page,<br>
especially the 3x3 avg page, but i feel that the 2 different ways of<br>
calculating the average time of the 10 cubes can be used to better your<br>
score.<br>
<br>
I have 2 examples of Dan Gosbees, and David Wesleys numbers, using both the<br>
real numbers with 2 decimals, and the ones without decimals and .5 sec<br>
addition to the time :<br>
<br>
Dan<br>
16.44 16.25 17.10 17.18 16.47 15.19 17.08 17.11 18.00 18.09 =&gt; avg 16.89<br>
16 16 17 17 16 15 17 17 18 18 =&gt; avg 16.7 + 0.5 =&gt; 17.2<br>
<br>
David<br>
16.33 18.13 17.86 18.44 16.75 16.88 17.05 16.99 17.31 17.85 =&gt; avg 17.36<br>
16 18 17 18 16 16 17 16 17 17 =&gt; 16.8 + 0.5 =&gt; 17.3<br>
<br>
In Dan&#x27;s case his best score comes from using the system with decimals, but<br>
in David&#x27;s case he would get a better score from removing the decimals and<br>
addind .5 of a sec.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not saying that anyone on this list takes advantage of this to get a<br>
better placing than he deserves, but i feel that it would be more fair if<br>
everyone uses the same system.<br>

your corner method is pretty interesting.  What i don&#x27;t understand is 
that you didn&#x27;t say anything about fixing any of the edge pieces, 
maybe i missed something. Any way very impressive!!!!!!!

          <div class="email-content">Today I set another new avg record: 17.04 secs<br>
My times were:<br>
15.89 16.95 (14.41) 20.00 14.88 (24.53) 16.64 17.58 20.55 16.25 <br>
14.49 17.17<br>
As you can see very uneven times, but no one was by <br>
definition &quot;lucky&quot;. I lubed my cube for the first time for several <br>
weeks, and that made a very big difference! I also made an avg of <br>
16.80 but one of the solves had a skipped &quot;OLL&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t post <br>
it. The last month I have improved from 18.23 to 17.04, and now I <br>
wonder if my improvements will ever stop. I guess that the main <br>
reason for me becoming faster so quickly is that I train A LOT, <br>
often several hours a day. Ron has always said that going slow is <br>
the key, and I must agree. At least trying to look ahead as far as <br>
possible. It&#x27;s in the F2L you can save the most time. Hopefully I <br>
will put out a video of me cubing some time soon on the net, so you <br>
can see my technique or style and who I am. <br>
Anyway I just want to encourage everybody to keep on practising, <br>
because that&#x27;s what makes you faster!<br>

Shades of Rain Man? Perhaps you&#x27;re too fond of the number a billion 
or don&#x27;t really appreciate its magnitude.

(There isn&#x27;t enough time to learn a billion places of pi. If you 
learnt one per second without any interruptions, which in itself is 
impossible, and could recall them all it would take over 31 years.)

I was never too into learning pi. I only got to 830 (after the 3), 
not even enough to get into the 1000 club. Maybe I will try again 
after I&#x27;m done cubing.

Jessica is amazingly fast. I saw her do the cube in 13.09 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Hello David,<br>
<br>
I have responded once already but the posting did not show up. If it <br>
eventually does, I apologize to everybody. I hope Yahoo works.<br>
<br>
David, your sudden improvement indicates that your brain is moving <br>
the system into a different level. You started &quot;digesting&quot; it and now <br>
you solve without any breaks, right? ;) Keep it up and do not try to <br>
change or &quot;improve&quot; anything at this point. That could set you back :)<br>
<br>
Also, go ahead and count that average with one lucky OLL. It is a <br>
valid position as any other. This applies to LLP as well. If you <br>
discount lucky cases, you should discount unlucky cases when you did <br>
18.9 because you got a really baaad combination of algs that you <br>
hate ... That does not make sense, right? So, go ahead and post your <br>
16.8 average ;)<br>
<br>
It is amazing how the vision of the championship motivates people to <br>
practice and become good. I doubt we would have that many people <br>
averaging close to 17 if there was no championship.<br>
<br>
You are 16, right? And possessed, too, right? ;) Congratulations!!!<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>

&gt; Today I set another new avg record: 17.04 secs<br>

&gt; 14.49 17.17<br>
&gt; As you can see very uneven times, but no one was by <br>
&gt; definition &quot;lucky&quot;. I lubed my cube for the first time for several <br>

&gt; 16.80 but one of the solves had a skipped &quot;OLL&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t post <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Congratulations on your great improvements!

The reason why we remove a best and worst time in an average run is to allow at
least one error and lucky case.
So all lucky cases can be counted during an average run.
Please post your 16.80 seconds average.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Terje,<br>
<br>
Welcome to the club! Please join us one day in the chatroom during the weekends<br>
and we can have a chat.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that it would be better to compare when all cubists would post<br>
averages using the same timing system.<br>
Still I would like to make the following remarks:<br>
= The list is FUN and useful to cubists, to see where they stand and to get<br>
motivated by the ever growing number of cube fools like us. It was Chris<br>
Hardwick&#x27;s idea, and he is still amazed about the success of the list. We just<br>
had our 400th person on the 3x3x3 single solve record list!<br>
= The Unofficial World Records are, as the name already says, not official. You<br>
wouldn&#x27;t even know how many cubists DID NOT post their records. There are still<br>
many unlisted members on the club. But the group of -to us- unknown cubists is<br>
huge. We only see the group with Internet access, and from that group only those<br>
who dare to post their records. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone from a small<br>
town in Korea would win the world championship averaging 13 seconds.<br>
= All circumstances are different. Alone in your bed room, at the office with 5<br>
colleagues watching, or on a stage with an audience.<br>
= Some cubists start cubing when they see the 0 of the timer, some start the<br>
timer by releasing a key on the keyboard, some try to start at exactly 0<br>
seconds.<br>
= Some cubists take averages dozens of times a day. Some cubists take one<br>
average a month, on a sunday afternoon. Some take rolling averages, some don&#x27;t.<br>
<br>
So records will always be hard to compare.<br>
<br>
But yes: everyone in decimals would be better. Actually many records were posted<br>
before we had Jess&#x27;s fantastic timer.<br>
The reason why I don&#x27;t post records in decimals is that I have very bad light in<br>
my computer room. But I hope to change that soon.<br>
<br>
What is your reason for not posting at all? ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Brent that is correct. I have memorized up to 120 
digits a while ago and I feel it has helped me learn algorithms
easier. It does move to your subconsious pretty fast. After not 
reciting Pi for a few months, it came to me just as easily. It&#x27;s a 
very usefull skill to be able to do stuff and not think about it.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hello David,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have responded once already but the posting did not show up. If <br>
it <br>
&gt; eventually does, I apologize to everybody. I hope Yahoo works.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; David, your sudden improvement indicates that your brain is moving <br>
&gt; the system into a different level. You started &quot;digesting&quot; it and <br>
now <br>
&gt; you solve without any breaks, right? ;) Keep it up and do not try <br>
to <br>
&gt; change or &quot;improve&quot; anything at this point. That could set you <br>
back :)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Also, go ahead and count that average with one lucky OLL. It is a <br>
&gt; valid position as any other. This applies to LLP as well. If you <br>
&gt; discount lucky cases, you should discount unlucky cases when you <br>
did <br>
&gt; 18.9 because you got a really baaad combination of algs that you <br>
&gt; hate ... That does not make sense, right? So, go ahead and post <br>
your <br>
&gt; 16.8 average ;)<br>
Sorry, I haven&#x27;t got my times left =( But I&#x27;ll beat soon anyway...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It is amazing how the vision of the championship motivates people <br>
to <br>
&gt; practice and become good. I doubt we would have that many people <br>
&gt; averaging close to 17 if there was no championship.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; You are 16, right? And possessed, too, right? ;) Congratulations!!!<br>
<br>
Yes I am young and cube often several hours a day =)<br>
Thanks for your help! I also want to see video of you!<br>
&gt; Jessica<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Today I set another new avg record: 17.04 secs<br>
&gt; &gt; My times were:<br>
&gt; &gt; 15.89 16.95 (14.41) 20.00 14.88 (24.53) 16.64 17.58 20.55 16.25 <br>
&gt; &gt; 14.49 17.17<br>
&gt; &gt; As you can see very uneven times, but no one was by <br>
&gt; &gt; definition &quot;lucky&quot;. I lubed my cube for the first time for <br>
several <br>
&gt; &gt; weeks, and that made a very big difference! I also made an avg <br>
of <br>
&gt; &gt; 16.80 but one of the solves had a skipped &quot;OLL&quot;, so I didn&#x27;t <br>
post <br>
&gt; &gt; it. The last month I have improved from 18.23 to 17.04, and now <br>
I <br>
&gt; &gt; wonder if my improvements will ever stop. I guess that the main <br>
&gt; &gt; reason for me becoming faster so quickly is that I train A LOT, <br>
&gt; &gt; often several hours a day. Ron has always said that going slow <br>
is <br>
&gt; &gt; the key, and I must agree. At least trying to look ahead as far <br>
as <br>
&gt; &gt; possible. It&#x27;s in the F2L you can save the most time. Hopefully <br>
I <br>
&gt; &gt; will put out a video of me cubing some time soon on the net, so <br>
you <br>
&gt; &gt; can see my technique or style and who I am. <br>
&gt; &gt; Anyway I just want to encourage everybody to keep on practising, <br>
&gt; &gt; because that&#x27;s what makes you faster!<br>

Sorry Ron, I never saved my times =( I have always thought that 
every lucky case should be discarded in an average run. Isn&#x27;t that 
what the rules say?? But it doesn&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;ll probably beat it 
soon anyway. It&#x27;s enough for myself to know how fast I am...

  Dan (Harris) I am surprised that you did not post to this forum what <br>
  happened during the 5/16 Fewest Move Challenge. I think that what <br>
  Mirek and David Barr did was absolutely incredible! :) Anyway, here <br>
  is the story as it evolved in front of my eyes (Mirek Goljan sits <br>
  next door here at Binghamton University).<br>
<br>
  I remember Mirek telling me that this time the cube was mixed really <br>
  well and he expressed his doubts that anyone will get below 30. I <br>
  would like to remind everybody that the cube was randomly scrambled <br>
  using 25 moves. Mirek found a 30-move solution and David Barr was <br>
  second with 34 moves. Mirek looked at David&#x27;s solution and quickly <br>

  finished the cube differently than David, embedded a three-cycle of <br>
  corners, and got, believe or not, a solution in 21 (!!!) moves. That <br>
  is 4 moves shorter than the scrambling algorithm (!!) and only <br>
  slightly longer what Herbert Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer found! <br>
<br>

You are not useless! BTW, I should say _thank_you_ for starting this <br>
challenge! It is a wonderful idea, indeed. Also, I somehow do not <br>
believe that this was soooo lucky and will never be repeated. As <br>
more people participate and methods develop, we may see more short <br>
solutions (i.e., below 25). I just do not believe that the second <br>
scrambling Mirek got his hands on was THAT lucky. Perhaps, the <br>
abilities of humans are not that inferior to a computer. I am really <br>
curious how the scores in the FMC evolve. And I am happy to have <br>
someone like Mirek closeby to watch with fascination.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
In Chess game, human predetermined the position of the king and <br>
queen on the board.  The cube is immuable in its movements and <br>
universal language.  I know that most cube people consider the <br>
center move = 2 moves. That&#x27;s the way computer count (poor). The <br>
cube allows but 1 move from the center rows, but it takes a longer <br>
move. But what would you say about 5x5x5 cube from center row?  And <br>
2x2x2 pocket cube L&#x27;+R= none ?  <br>
<br>
Marc Waterman use 50 moves or 90 moves ? No chance for me and the <br>
slide cubists. It deprives you the opportunity of solving the cube <br>
with the fewest moves and a long inspection time for the layer by <br>
layer method. <br>

Everyone [and I mean EVERYONE]:<br>
<br>
Since school is out over here, I have decided to START a new contest for you cubers out there (I planned to call it the &#x27;Friday contest&#x27;).  The Sunday Contest and the Fewest moves contest are both very popular and exciting (both excellent ideas).  [Yes Dan, a good idea to start the FMC indeed].  So I come to the thought: &#x27;What should this new contest be about?&#x27;.  So I come and ask you cube guys (and girls):  <br>
<br>
What should this new contest be about? OR even, SHOULD there even BE ANOTHER contest?  I would like all the inputs and info!  Jessica, Ron, what do you think?  I hope everyone has some ideas, good or bad...  Thanks for your time...;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well first of all I think maybe a Wednesday contest might work <br>
because it&#x27;ll break up the long week, or for someone who is out of <br>
school and not working will give us something to do. Just a thought. <br>
Anyway you could do various challenges like, fewest moves for the <br>
square-1 the 4x4, 5x5, megaminx, or whatever challenges you like. <br>
Then maybe combine them saying : here are the scrambeling alogrythems <br>
for these (x number of puzzles), now find the shortest moves total. <br>
And if someone dosn&#x27;t have all the puzzles then there will be a <br>
catagory for individual puzzles. Take my advice or not I don&#x27;t care, <br>
this is your contest. Have a great day. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello JAKE:
Man, this is awesome stuff!  Do you have a website or something where you have strategies of memorizing 5000 digits of PI?  I really would have the devotion for memorizing such a large amount, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the TIME for it...  That&#x27;s amazing, really!  How many digits can you remember by hand now?  Just curious...  I find this interesting.  How did you get enough attention to get flown to NEW YORK?  Amazing stuff man!

I like this idea for the handicap thing.

I also think it would be a good idea to have the contest on 
wednesday.  I&#x27;d like to see a variety of contests, a different one 
every week...here are my ideas for different contsts;

-different puzzles(one time or average)
-doing puzzles with only looking into a mirror
-have a list of places to solve a cube through the week(underwater, 
infront of a group of 20+, on a roller coaster....im not going to 
think of too many right now, but this could get creative!
-# of cubes per hour
-biggest crowd to cube infront of through out the week (this would 
ecnourage people to cube in public more)
-most people to teach how to cube through the week(i know this would 
make me want to teach someone how to cube)
-fastest time on a computer cube
-largest cube solved

---basically you could just go through the Unofficial Worlds Records 
Pages and find a ton of different categories.

Hi Terje!<br>
<br>
I agree that it would be better to have a standard, although I like<br>
to cube in a cafe, so I don&#x27;t have a good sub-second timer yet.  But<br>
I don&#x27;t think there is as much of a problem with using the integer<br>
method as you might think -- you happened to choose an example <br>
average that is a bit of an anomaly.<br>
<br>
The 16.89 average is unusual in that the average decimal<br>
portion of the times is 0.2 (when you truncate the integer portion).  <br>
Assuming there is a normal distribution of decimals between .0 <br>
and .99999999 with a mean value of .5, the standard deviation for the <br>
average decimal portion in a sample size of 12 times is about 0.083 <br>
seconds.  This means that the 16.89 average is over 3.6 standard <br>
deviations from the mean.  (Probability 1 in 5000).  That&#x27;s why there <br>
is such a big difference between the real average and the integer <br>
average.<br>
<br>
The 17.36 average, on the other hand, has an average decimal portion <br>
of 0.559, which is 0.71 standard deviations away from the mean, <br>
falling in the middle 52.2% of averages.  That&#x27;s why the decimal-to-<br>
integer discrepancy is much smaller.<br>
<br>
Approximately:<br>
<br>
87% of integer averages are accurate to within +/- 0.1 seconds.<br>
98.3% of integer averages are accurate to within +/- 0.2 seconds.<br>
99.96% of integer averages are accurate to within +/- 0.3 seconds.<br>
<br>
So that&#x27;s why I think the situation that you brought up is kind of <br>
unusual.  Here are some other averages in the top 20, comparing the <br>
real average to the integer average + 0.5:<br>
<br>
Katsuyuki Konishi: 17.49 versus 17.60 (+0.11)<br>
Jess Bonde: 17.70 versus 17.70 (same!)<br>
Masayuki Akimoto: 18.22 versus 18.30 (-0.08)<br>
Lars Vandenbergh: 19.01 versus 19.00 (+0.01)<br>
Ross Palmer: 19.75 versus 19.70 (+0.05)<br>
<br>
<br>
Another good statistical measure is the maximum of the 12 decimal <br>
portions from each average.  Again assuming a normal distribution, <br>
the mean value of the maximum decimal for an average of 12 times <br>
is .923.  But for the 16.89 average, the max is only 0.47.  The <br>
probability of getting an average like this is actually fewer than 1 <br>
in 10,000 averages, so the big discrepancy is pretty rare.<br>
<br>
Of course I agree that the online records are <br>
officially &quot;unofficial&quot; anyway - that&#x27;s why they should just be for <br>
fun!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron<br>
<br>
Thanks for the invite. I&#x27;ll stop by the chatroom next time :)<br>
<br>
I was cubing a lot in the early 80&#x27;s, using a layer by layer method but<br>
didnt really try to get the fastest, just had a lot of fun with the cube. I<br>
got my avg below the minute but not much.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been sporadicly cubing since then but got the bug again a couple of<br>
weeks ago, but have a totally unusable cube for speedcubing. I have clocked<br>
myself to 49 sec on a layer by layer method with this cube but i wont post<br>
any scores before i have a better cube.<br>
I have ordered a prepared studio cube from Ton, so when i get it i&#x27;ll post<br>
my scores :)<br>
<br>
If i get fast enough i might even try to learn a few more algos, but right<br>
now i&#x27;m too lazy and have too much other stuff going on.<br>
<br>
Terje<br>
<br>
p.s. I agree with you on that there are many different reasons to why the<br>
scores are hard to compare accurately, and that&#x27;s why they are indeed<br>
unofficial records :)<br>

&gt; Hi Terje,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Welcome to the club! Please join us one day in the chatroom<br>
&gt; during the weekends<br>
&gt; and we can have a chat.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I agree with you that it would be better to compare when all<br>
&gt; cubists would post<br>
&gt; averages using the same timing system.<br>
&gt; Still I would like to make the following remarks:<br>
&gt; = The list is FUN and useful to cubists, to see where they stand<br>
&gt; and to get<br>
&gt; motivated by the ever growing number of cube fools like us. It was Chris<br>
&gt; Hardwick&#x27;s idea, and he is still amazed about the success of the<br>
&gt; list. We just<br>
&gt; had our 400th person on the 3x3x3 single solve record list!<br>
&gt; = The Unofficial World Records are, as the name already says, not<br>
&gt; official. You<br>
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t even know how many cubists DID NOT post their records.<br>
&gt; There are still<br>
&gt; many unlisted members on the club. But the group of -to us-<br>
&gt; unknown cubists is<br>
&gt; huge. We only see the group with Internet access, and from that<br>
&gt; group only those<br>
&gt; who dare to post their records. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if<br>
&gt; someone from a small<br>
&gt; town in Korea would win the world championship averaging 13 seconds.<br>
&gt; = All circumstances are different. Alone in your bed room, at the<br>
&gt; office with 5<br>
&gt; colleagues watching, or on a stage with an audience.<br>
&gt; = Some cubists start cubing when they see the 0 of the timer,<br>
&gt; some start the<br>
&gt; timer by releasing a key on the keyboard, some try to start at exactly 0<br>
&gt; seconds.<br>
&gt; = Some cubists take averages dozens of times a day. Some cubists take one<br>
&gt; average a month, on a sunday afternoon. Some take rolling<br>
&gt; averages, some don&#x27;t.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So records will always be hard to compare.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But yes: everyone in decimals would be better. Actually many<br>
&gt; records were posted<br>
&gt; before we had Jess&#x27;s fantastic timer.<br>
&gt; The reason why I don&#x27;t post records in decimals is that I have<br>
&gt; very bad light in<br>
&gt; my computer room. But I hope to change that soon.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Of the ideas proposed so far I really like the handicap contest and 
the cubing in different scenarios idea.  When I had a club at my high 
school I used to do handicap races among people a lot, since everyone 
was at a different skill levels.  The handicap races were usually 
head to head or maybe 3 or 4 people but I&#x27;m sure they can be expanded 
to more.  Anyway they really are a lot of fun because if you do the 
handicap right, then pretty much anyone has a good chance of winning 
that round, which makes everyone nervous and try to cube faster :)  
We could make the handicap include unique stuff too, like one handed 
or solving 2 or more cubes, in addition to the typical head start 
idea.  I also think it would be cool to have to cube in those 
different scenarios every week (in front of 20+ people, etc.).  Just 
my two cents.

This is always the problem in high-class competitions,  where 
fractions of a second count.
Whztever you do, make  sure Gyinness approves of the sveraging 
method. Maybe the timer should be hooked to a computer, that would 
automatically calculate the aversge. The program that does the 
calculating should be written by Guinness. Use those numbers to 
deterine the winner. (PS. I am merely a cube artist - thanks God!)

 The Sunday Contest and the Fewest moves contest are both very popular

the FMC indeed].  So I come to the thought: &#x27;What should this new

Hi Brent,

   New contest?

   A cube may be held with each of the six colors as the Up side and
rotated with four different colors facing Front; therefore we have 24
overall facings. Take a scramble and apply it to all 24 facings and do
24 solves, use it as a double 12 fastest: throw out the slowest two
and fastest two, and average the remaining twenty.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all, as you may have heard from my incessant babbling, I recently got a megaminx.  So I finally settled down and took my first average of 12 solutions.  To scramble I just twisted probably about 200 times while not looking.  I then had 10 seconds inspection, and started twisting like crazy :).<br>
<br>
So my first average is 4:59.68.  Times were:<br>
4:36.52   5:39.86  POP  (4:24.58)  5:05.99  5:41.69  4:58.74  (6:11.22)  5:13.71  4:47.19  4:30.58  4:31.92  4:50.58<br>
<br>
I had piece pops a couple times, but only counted the one.  It is a 12 color megaminx as well.  I used the solution I came up with, which is a mixture of my solution to the 3x3x3 cube and a few last layer steps that I just kinda made up.  If anyone is interested in my solution, I typed it all out last night.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I&#x27;m looking for pointers to get closer to that record of 2:11.56 set by Grant Tregay! (Yeah right, that&#x27;s a long way off for me!)<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
Daniel Hayes<br>
<br>
BTW, I&#x27;m not sure if I mentioned it, but the pyraminx is effectively fixed... a bit more loose than I&#x27;d like, but still, it works at least :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Team solving...I like that idea-very original. That would be rather 
hard if you can&#x27;t talk to eachother and don&#x27;t even know what method 
the other people are doing. Each person should be able to do up to 
10 moves (or 1 alg) before handing the cube off to make it a little 
faster and easier. Doing this in person with 1 cube would be a lot 
easier but there are ways to do it over the net. This would work for 
fastest time or fewest moves. The later being easier to do through 
the net.

P.S. I like the cubing using feet idea for a contest. I have good 
dexterity in my toes and with a little practice and a slick cube, I 
could break some records :)

Instead of several people doing one move each on one cube, how about 
one person doing one move each on several cubes?

What I mean is this: Have a row of say 10 cubes, all mixed 
differently. Do one move on the first cube, one move on the second, 
and so on, repeat until all are solved. I suppose it would be a bit 
like blindfold chess, in that you have to remember what you were 
doing on each cube.

<br>
I just posted some pictures from April when I met with Richard Carr <br>
(master of blindfold cubing and Oinkleburger) here in Binghamton. <br>
Richard did the 3x3x3 cube blindfolded in a little over 5 minutes <br>
including memorization. It was fascinating seeing this in real life!<br>

Also, I just asked a friend of mine to tape me so that I can stop <br>
this procrastination and post some movies. We did some closeups of my <br>
hands and whole views, as well. They were mostly 16&#x27;s. I also did 4 <br>
of my favorite lightning fast finger tricks! I am curious if I can <br>
beat the 8 moves per second record set by Dan Knights! :) For this, <br>
we need to analyze the video frame-by-frame, however. The person who <br>
taped this told me that the movie looked like fast-forwarded <br>

to do only ten moves or so before handing the cube off.

Well, so far, I have decided to stick with the idea of having a &#x27;handicap&#x27; contest with your fastest 3x3x3 average posted on speedcubing.com (possibly with larger cubes as well...)  Also, it WILL be called the Wednesday Contest, and each day will have a seperate contest on cubing in front of the most people, cubing with one hand, etc.  I will have ALL the details, AND the contest UP and RUNNING by June 25, by the ABSOLUTE latest (since I am loaded with summer assignments, etc.).  So, if you have any suggestions, or criticisms about this, just let me know so far ;).  So it is:  The Wednesday Contest! :)<br>

Hey Lars,

I once timed my execution of Ri Ui R Ui Ri U2 R (7 moves) in 0.86 
seconds using a video.  So it looks like you&#x27;ve got me beat!

BTW, I am living in San Francisco now, and I would love to meet up 
sometime.  Is there anyone else reading this list in the bay area who 
would like to get together?

Dan

No need to apologize, this was a privilege to see these videos :)
I was looking forward to see you cubing, just as many other people. 
You achieve very good times with delays between algs, I&#x27;m sure that 
you could easily place first on speedcubing list if you manage to cut 
this delays.

No, sadly, I don&#x27;t have a web page with strategies for memorizing.  But I know something that really helped me was to keep a rhythm while reciting the digits.  Going at full speed I kindof sounded like I was rapping the digits.  This is also something I enjoy doing while cubing, to get my finger tricks to punch out a rhythm....does anyone else do this?  

At this point I only remember the first few hundred digits of pi.  In fact, it had probably been a good year since I last recited it when you first posted and I tried to check your digits.  So in a way I&#x27;m still surprised that I know as many as I do!  

About the time commitment.  It might not take you so long to memorize so many digits as you think if you really have an insane passion for it.  I really memorized most of those 5000 digits in the span of a week, and even averaged more than 1000 digits a day on the weekend (this was the week before the competition, so I gave it my all)
But I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend such an extreme approach either, my head hurt for a few weeks after and I had a hard time doing simple daily neccesites for a while.  

I did forget those last couple thousand digits a few days after reciting, which goes to show you that I probably just have a good short term memory....which is also why I now enjoy spending most of my cubing time solving blindfolded.

I got so much attention with the memorizing because my home town paper (the &#x27;Fargo Forum,&#x27;  yeah, I live in Fargo, ND) wrote an article that made its way to the associated press; and then any paper/TV station in world has my contact info and can print the information (I have newspapers from both Taiwan and New Zealand where I&#x27;m on the front page!).  So with New York, I just got a call from the Today show a few days after I&#x27;d won the competition and they said &quot;hey, ya wanna be on our show?&quot;  And, well, how can you resist that?

Good luck on all you memorizing and cubing,

Jake E.

The start of e is pretty easy at least. I only ever really learned 
to about 40, but I guess I could go a lot further.
Anyway, now I only remember the start as it is fairly simple:

2.718281828459045

Note: 27=3^3 or 3*3^2, 18=2*3^2, 28=3^+1, then 1828 again.
45-90-45 are the angles (in degrees) of a (Euclidean) right-angled 
isoceles triangle with the right angle in the middle.

A much easier transcendental number to learn is Liouville&#x27;s number.

Excellent videos!!!  I have to say, as I watched these &#x27;lightning fast&#x27; videos i fell off the chair.  It was a privelage.  I know I won&#x27;t get a &#x27;top&#x27; placing at the championships, but I will be glad to see all the pros be there, and see them in person.  (Jessica, Ron, Katsu, Chris, Knights..and many others).

Well it could be useful to learn some new algs, at least the <br>

use than if I had used the normal alg. So the total time may still <br>
not be faster, although you perform less moves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I have just posted a Windows Cube Timer application.  Anyone is <br>
welcome to try it out, but it&#x27;s a test version so I can&#x27;t promise it <br>
will work!  You need an Pentium-class (or better) processor. I wrote <br>
this in Visual Basic 6 using the &quot;QueryPerformanceCounter&quot; function, <br>
which is accurate to nearly 1 millionth of a second.<br>
<br>
I developed this because I wanted to fix some faults with all of the <br>
other available cube timers:<br>
<br>
1. Only the space bar makes the time start and stop.  Thus, it is not <br>
possible to mess up your time by hitting other keys.  Sometimes when <br>
I&#x27;m using Ron&#x27;s timer, it deletes my time as soon as I stop the <br>
timer, so that I can&#x27;t write it down.<br>
<br>
2. The timer starts as soon as the space bar is RELEASED.  The timer <br>
ends as soon as the space bar is PRESSED.  Although I really like the <br>
functionality and presentation of Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer, it stops the <br>
time when the key has been pressed and released, which means you lose <br>
some time if you forget to tap the key quickly.<br>
<br>
Notes for usage:<br>
- The Cube Timer keeps your times and average copied to the system <br>
clipboard, so you can just go into a text document and paste them in!<br>
- The Cube Timer allows you to delete times, in case one of them was <br>
a pop, or the time was produced by mistake.<br>
- I made this in about 4 hours as my first Visual Basic project, so <br>
it&#x27;s just a test version.<br>
- I like to use a Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard, which has a nice big <br>
space bar for slamming down the cube!<br>

This is a really good functionality.<br>
<br>
There is one problem: The time indicator doesn&#x27;t change fast enough. I&#x27;ve<br>
got a best average at 55 - although just yesterday and today I&#x27;ve improved<br>
a big step whereby I&#x27;m actually *disappointed* when it&#x27;s as high as 55. I<br>
should be able to get a sub-50 average (another 10 seconds less and it&#x27;ll<br>
be speedcubing!! ;) <br>
<br>
So I have lotsa time to check how I&#x27;m getting on mid-solution. (unlike you<br>
guys who clock in at 17s regularly). I would get to an easy PLL at 39s, think<br>
<br>
&quot;wahey, looking good&quot; and clock a 45, wondering what I did wrong.<br>
<br>
The answer is that the timer doesn&#x27;t tick over quick enough. In fact it loses<br>
about 3 seconds every 40s. Is there anything that can be done about this??<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;After placing the cross, since all F2L slots are empty, do the faster <br>
&gt;cubers use the shortest (or perhaps fastest given finger tricks) algorithm <br>
&gt;to solve any F2L case? What I am basically asking is did you find it <br>
&gt;necessary to learn a new set of algorithms which take advantage of the fact <br>
&gt;that all slots are empty, and then use your more standard ones later on.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I reckon some shortcuts (i.e. using empty slots to do different moves from <br>
the basic set of 41 F2L algorithms) are so much faster you really should <br>
become familiar with them; especially the ones where the edge cubie is in <br>
the wrong slot and the corner is on the top face  (R&#x27;F2R, for example), but <br>
exactly how far it is worth travelling down this path will depend on each <br>
individual.  But of course you won&#x27;t be able to decide for yourself without <br>
looking into it yourself.  And some of the standard moves are the same <br>
length, regardless of how many corners are free.<br>
<br>
Lots of the best speed cubists use shortcuts, confirmed by going through <br>
examples of their F2Ls, like this one of Jessica&#x27;s:<br>
<br>
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/examples.html<br>
<br>
In one of these examples she even uses odd pairs to speed things up!  (I <br>
think Olly also uses odd pairs, but when I asked Ron about this he said he <br>
only does so very rarely.)<br>
<br>
For all those who have not explored these shortcuts, a basic set can be <br>
found here:<br>
<br>
http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/.<br>
<br>
Some other good ones can be found at www.speedcubing.com:<br>
<br>
Algorithms --&gt; First two layers --&gt; Advanced tricks for F2L<br>
<br>
As a consequence of learning these my F2L got significantly slower at first, <br>
but the recognition is definitely speeding up now, as it becomes more <br>
automatic.  If I ever get it fully automatic I reckon I would be looking at <br>
a dramatic improvement compared to if I had just stuck to the basic 41.<br>
<br>
So what are the problems / advantages of incorporating more algorithms?  If <br>
you think about it, the F2L goes through two stages, up to four times:<br>
<br>
1a. finding a corner / edge pair that needs inserting, AND<br>
1b. deciding which algorithm to use<br>
<br>
2a  executing the algorithm, AND<br>
2b  starting again on 1a and 1b (or OLL if last corner)<br>
<br>
The first stage may happen more often, because you may spot more than one <br>
corner / edge pair, and want to select the optimal pair.<br>
<br>
Now, familiarizing yourself with a whole load of extra moves that use empty <br>
slots means, for each step:<br>
<br>
1a.  no change<br>
<br>
1b.  more complicated, and potentially slower<br>
<br>
2a.  potentially faster, but of course fewer moves does not necessarily mean <br>
fewer seconds, because some moves and algorithms can be done much faster <br>
than others.<br>
<br>
2b.  potentially *slightly* harder, but perhaps no change (?)<br>
<br>
So it is all up to you!!<br>
<br>
====<br>
<br>
Another (more personal) thought about number of moves in F2L ...<br>
<br>
Say you are just starting on F2L and notice that you can insert your first <br>
corner / edge slot with the following:<br>
<br>
L U2 L&#x27;<br>
<br>
I no longer do this.  Now I would do:<br>
<br>
U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
This is an extra move, but for some reason I find it much much easier to <br>
look ahead (step 2b) if I break the U2 into two separate moves.  With LU2L&#x27; <br>
I find it a lot harder to follow the pieces and anticipate where they will <br>
end up; with ULU&#x27;L&#x27; sometimes I have already found the next pair before <br>
finishing up.<br>
<br>
So, by adding moves to my F2L some of my F2L solves are up to 2 seconds <br>
faster than before.  Wierd, huh?  I wonder if anyone else might be the same <br>
...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dan,

I like this timer. It is more idiot proof then the others out there. 
However I have a few ideas. I think it should follow tradition and 
only go out to the hundredths, or at least give and option to change 
this. My major issue is that it should have and option to beep 
during the timing similar to Bonde&#x27;s timer. Is the average given, 
the session average or the average of the last X times? Also how is 
the trimmed average calculated, within all the times or the last 12? 
The timer should take into account that some people do running 
averages while others do not. It would be nice to add and option on 
how the times are copied into the clipboard, I prefer the times to 
be separated by returns for example. Thanks for the timer. I think 
I&#x27;ll use it as my default cube timer.

-Doug

P.S. oh and if it&#x27;s not too much trouble, how about a progress 
graph... No just kidding.
P.S.S. I know you helped make the diagrams on Helmstetter&#x27;s site. I 
would like to know if I could use them on my upcomming website. Also 
I am working on a script to generate my own based on my own 
notation. It was probably ages ago when you worked on that, but I 
was wondering if I could have a copy of that, assuming that&#x27;s what 
you used and that you or Helmstetter still have it.
BTW any one who is an expert on ASP, please e-mail me 
(d_funny007@...).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Greg,

   I know what you mean. Excluding pops and mistakes, which
fortunately are rare, the I times I record:

Always beat: 45seconds
Usually beat: 40 seconds
My average: about 34 or 35seconds
The most common times: 42, 37, 34, 31
The best unlucky: 24.27
The best lucky: 21.00
Aiming for: 30 sec or less, frequency: 2 or 3 times a day.

   Does this provide a good enough picture?

   My most common times fall roughly into 4 groups depending on what
algoritms I know for particular scrambles. Somethings I&#x27;m quicker at
than others. I don&#x27;t have a full set of LL algorithms yet.

   I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;m finally beating 40 seconds on a regular basis,
but I know that&#x27;s real slow compared to many.

Yes, pi=4*arctan(1). However, why use that formula? It is very inefficient. It takes 628 terms to approximate pi to just two decimal places. Ramanujan has a formula that add 8 digits of pi every iteration. Other methods exist. Like Euler&#x27;s series for k = 4:<br>

I think you would agree that memorization is needed for proficiency in anything. I hope you do not visualize, derive, and then formulate the multiplication table from one to ten every time you need to do simple multiplication. I love to do exactly what you said, but I memorize things once I understand them. This way, doing the next step is a bit easier. You make it sound to me as if you would try developing calculus by starting out with arithmetic, developing algebra, developing geometry and trig, then calculus without memorizing rules (once understood). Surely, you memorized a lot of things to develop new things.<br>
<br>
Here is how I work in math:<br>
I understand all of the topic. I memorize the rules. I work problems using techniques I figure out on my own. <br>
<br>
I rarely resort to memorizing techniques of others, however I do need to memorize things.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I wish my name was up there on last week&#x27;s FMC :( I was at Disney World... I had my cube with me and the scrammbling algorithm written down. I did not have time to sit down and solve the who time. I woke up this morning to try it but I realized it was too late to send it in to be counted. I will try this week.<br>
<br>
I did notice the scramble was difficult... I could not pull off anything close to a 19 F2L solve like I did last week :-P I know many can do better then 19 moves but that is good for me.<br>

I had something else to say but I forgot... damn memory.<br>

Machin&#x27;s formula is quite good
pi = 16*arctan 1/5 - 4*arctan 1/239 is quite good.
The Chudnovsky&#x27;s had a good formula for pi.
The best known base 10 formulae have quadratic convergence or 
better, I think.
If you want pi in base 16 then the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe result is 
good. You can get places without calculating all the previous ones.

Well if it were me, first of all, I&#x27;d prove that a function called 
multiplication exists. This would involve first proving that 
addition exists and that would be preceded by proving a recursion 
theorem. Also, I&#x27;d have to define the natural numbers and so forth.

said, but I memorize things once I understand them. This way, doing 
the next step is a bit easier. You make it sound to me as if you 
would try developing calculus by starting out with arithmetic, 
developing algebra, developing geometry and trig, then calculus

lot of things to develop new things.

Understanding all of the topic can be quite hard. So even can all 
the rest of that technique.
Here&#x27;s a text to prove it:
Cardinal Arithmetic by Saharon Shelah.
If you can understand all of the topic, memorize the rules or work 
the problems using techniques you figure out on your own (any one of 
them, I&#x27;m not even asking for all), I&#x27;d be fairly impressed.

Hana, you shouldn&#x27;t need to memorize much of anything to find your 
designs.  they seem to be a lot of the classic 4 move center swap or 
6 move checkerboard pattern.  Some require more twisting then others 
but the individual cube patterns arent all that complicated.  Please 
don&#x27;t take offense to this but some of your designs just don&#x27;t seem 
all that impressive, its just a bunch of simple cube patterns stacked 
up on each other.  The main impressive thing about them is all the 
cubes you have for your designs!  The few designs that i do find 
interesting are the ones you use to show a mathmatical concept like 
fractles and such!  You definately have a unique perspective to the 
cubing world Hana, I am looking forward to seeing your designs in 
person some day!

I see you made the scrambling algorithm very easy to remember...

...so there&#x27;s going to be many many participants this week!

&gt; My average: about 34 or 35seconds<br>

<br>
I also wonder whether the accepted definitions of lucky and non-lucky<br>
are useful at all. IMHO, it looks like both of these were lucky in that<br>
they were much faster than your normal time.<br>
<br>
If someone performs every step of their solution, but encounters their<br>
&quot;best&quot; algorithm for their last two steps, surely this is lucky? I think<br>
looking at your times is the only way to know whether you were lucky or<br>
unlucky or normal.<br>
<br>
If we had some better definitions of lucky, nonlucky (normal) and<br>
unlucky, maybe we could just cancel out the lucky and unlucky times and<br>
average the rest. On the other hand, maybe we should only remove lucky<br>
times from the equation :-)<br>
<br>
In my opinion, people should be striving flatten out their times:<br>
<br>
- to prevent unlucky times, and<br>
- to not rely on the occasional lucky time to get a good average<br>
<br>
Counting only normal and unlucky times in your final average would seem<br>
to encourage that. Maybe one of mathematicians on this list can figure<br>
out how to calculate this statistic and even give it a name ;-)<br>

there is a legal agreement thing you have to adhere to etc 
etc....nothing major...not to worry....

yes we have dropped the entry fee....there are now 2 hotels in the 
picture....you do not have to worry about hotels...we are booking 
blocks at either 99 or 109CAD per night....decision being made 
wednesday and we hope the site will be up by friday....

once the hotel is settled then we inform competitors to book...you 
will ask for &quot;the rubiks cube&quot; rate and identify yourself as a 
competitor to the hotel...

piece of cake.....but not to worry ok....

i am itching for this site to go live...

I am about to start memorizing 17 of the 21 PLL algorithms. For all you that have memorized them all, how long did it take you? I plan to learn one to two a day... depending on my memory that day.<br>
<br>
I use the Petrus system and I want to do the LL with semi-2 looks. I say that because I will still flip the edges but only know 2 orientation cases (for the corners). If I figured it right... I will cut 9 moves average because I do not have to swap corners. In doing all of this, I will start averaging about 64 moves per solve. Later on I might memorize all the orientation cases for the corners so I can cut maybe 2-3 moves.<br>
What would you call this method... Semi-Petrich?<br>
<br>
After I learn the PLL cases, I will be able to solve the cube using Chris&#x27;s extended cross with more proficiency. Using his method, I average maybe 100 moves because I have to flip the LL edges two at a time with my own 8 move sequence :(<br>

<br>
I also used this system about 4 or 5 years ago. It didn&#x27;t have a name<br>
back then, but people now call it the Petrich system<br>
(http://borntodie.free.fr/themethod.htm). That is, when you learn all 13<br>
permutation and all 6 orientation algorithms. It&#x27;s a good way to get<br>
fast without learning too many algorithms (only 19).<br>
<br>
You should learn the permutations in a useful order. Here&#x27;s what I<br>
suggest (using the symbolic names on Jessica&#x27;s site):<br>
<br>
First phase:<br>
<br>
- &quot;A&quot; for moving corners (If you do corners before edges, you can just<br>
  rotate the LL around until one corner matches and apply this)<br>
- &quot;U&quot; for moving edges<br>
<br>
Second phase:<br>
<br>
- &quot;E&quot; for moving corners in special case<br>
- &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;H&quot; for moving edges in special cases<br>
<br>
Third phase:<br>
<br>
- Learn most common cases where you can move corners and edges in one<br>
  go: &quot;J&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;G&quot;. J is easy, G is difficult because you need to<br>
  learn how to do it forwards and backwards, left and right mirrored.<br>
  However, it is the most common case so worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Fourth phase:<br>
<br>
- The rest: &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;N&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
For &quot;H&quot; in the second phase, I recommend learning:<br>
<br>
	LRU2L&#x27;R&#x27;  +  B&#x27;F&#x27;U2BF<br>
<br>
which is easier to memorise.<br>
<br>
After you learn all those, you&#x27;ll find the 6 orientation algorithms much<br>
easier to learn (they are relatively short).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi James,

It took me three days to learn all PLL algorithms. I already knew the basic ones
of course. And for the new ones I started with the easiest algorithm. F.i. for
the cases P14-P17 (http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_permutation.html) I
used one algorithm normal/mirrored/inverted/mirrored+inverted.

Once you know all PLL algorithms, you will start learning better finger tricks
and better algorithms. We are all still looking for better algorithms for our
worst cases. It will probably never stop...

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hello Ron,<br>
<br>
I would like to figure out finger tricks. It is much easier to pick them up as one is learning the algorithms. I have nice tricks for swaping two corners but when I learn all the PLL cases, there will ne no need for it anymore. I can do that with an average of 4 moves/second. I solve the whole cube with an average of 1.45 moves/second on average. I am about 2.8 for the LL right now. Just imagine my F2L :-p<br>
<br>
At the time of this writing.. I already knew 4 of the cases and I just learned 2. I am working on the 3rd one although it is 1:34 AM. I figured I will learn 4 a day. I will do it by learning one row at speedcubing.com a day. Since I know the last one on the first row... I will just assume I learned it today and call it quits :)<br>

The 2x2x2 can seem confusing at first. How many moves does it take you to create it? Generally, I take an average of about 10-12 moves. Again, I have a method for doing this.

<br>
The only downside I have, really, is that I start off with the same block... all the time. Most of the time it is not a problem. I would say that one in every ten solves I get a bad setup and it messes up my solve time by a few seconds because I have to do a lot of shuffling of cubuies to get the job done :(<br>

          <div class="email-content">I also spent three days, like Ron I knew a few already, from having learnt simpler systems before, then I spent two days learning all of the cases minus the &quot;3-corner + 3-edge cycles&quot; (cases 18 to 21 on www.cubestation.co.uk) and then a day to learn the final four. Of course, the learning doesn&#x27;t stop there, but once you confidently know an algorithm for each PLL case, you can be much happier about going on to learn new/better/different angle algorithms and add them to your armoury!

Good luck mate - DanH

          <div class="email-content">The way I do the 2x2x2 part is I get a corner-edge pair put together
(either the blue-orange-yellow or the green-orange-yellow; I also 
find it helps to start with the same colors every time so I&#x27;m used to 
them). Then I put the corner-edge pair into the right place, then I 
add all the other edges. It&#x27;s basically the same for extending to 
2x2x3. Here&#x27;s a list of my average number of moves:

2x2x2: 10 9 12 14 [7] [15] 11 11 7 10 12 11 = 10.7
2x2x3: 8 8 7 9 9 9 8 7 8 [4] [10] 9 = 8.2
Orient edges: 3 [8] 4 3 5 [0] 3 6 3 6 2 4 = 3.9
Extend to 2 layers: 20 [11] 14 22 21 24 12 [25] 24 23 18 21 = 20.8
TOTAL: 43.6
My worst part, obviously, is the 2 Layers. But I believe that the 
2x2x2-2x2x3 can be much faster on average. But like I said before, 
since only two faces are being turned in step 4, I can do it really 
fast. I can&#x27;t find my good cube right now, but on my bad cube step 4 
takes about 7-8 seconds which is about 3 moves per second as opposed 
to my average 2 to 2.5 moves per second.

          <div class="email-content">It looks as if you are doing fine in terms of moves for the 2x2x2 block. I could learn how to do mine better :) I took an average last night on how many moves I do it in:<br>
[11 10 11 12 13 (14) 10 13 14 10 (7) 12] / 10 = 11.3 moves<br>
I used to average something like 20 because I did not know what I was doing. It took me a few days to figure out a strategy for making it. As for the 2x2x3, I place the top edge, then the corner, then the last edge. What I should work on is placing the top edge then the corner/edge pair.<br>
<br>
For speedsoloving, it looks like you are doing just fine in terms of moves. Competing step 4 in 7 seconds is great. I can complete it in about 8 seconds, which, for me, is 2.3 moves/sec. My last layer is about 3 moves/sec. I hate my speed for steps 1-3... it is something like 1 move/sec. I am working on improving that.<br>
<br>
I just had a thought... I notice that the number of moves you do for step 4 (extending to F2L) is not very consistent. I used to have that same problem. The method I used that caused such inconsistency was to place the top edge, place the corners, than place each edge in one at a time. I would vary between 18 moves and 32 moves (one or two times at 40!!). I have learned you do not have to turn just those two faces to finish the F2L. Mr. Petrus says on his site to make sure you turn only those faces, but I have one algorithm in which I don&#x27;t, and it cuts about 3 moves. That is a lot for me :) You just have to make sure that the edges stay oriented correctly.<br>
<br>
If you want, I can find out the average number of moves I use to complete the F2L just for a comparsion. And, I hope I am not coming off as an expert of the Petrus system... hehe. I am still learning, too :)<br>

Yes, you can use sequences involving 3 sides (for example: Non<br>
matching pairs<br>
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/speed4.html).<br>
But I doubt you can save time doing this, because sequences based on R<br>
and U sides only (right hand &amp; left index + never change the grip) are<br>
faster than light. And you know how fast light can be.<br>

          <div class="email-content">For step four, I came up with a few alorithms sort of by accident 
that are loaded with finger tricks. That&#x27;s how I do it so quickly. 
I&#x27;ll try to explain it, but it&#x27;s kind of confusing:
1. Put the first selected corner on the last layer, facing 
downwards. So if the top color was orange, then the orange side of 
the corner will be on the bottom, or red, face. For this example, 
this corner will be orange-blue-white, and the edge will be blue-
white.
2. I&#x27;m going to try to explain what the cube looks like now: The top 
color is orange, the front is white, the bottom is red, the left is 
green, and the right is blue. The corner is on the bottom layer 
facing down. Then you get the blue-white edge into the proper 
location, on the right side of the white face, and do the move F2. 
This way, the blue-white edge is in the green-white location. Make 
sure you don&#x27;t move the blue-white-orange corner from it&#x27;s position 
facing downwards on the LL.
3. Turn the LL until the blue-white-orange corner matches up with 
the blue-white edge. Then you can simply place the blue-white-orange 
corner-edge pair into the right place.

This probably sounds reeaally confusing, but it makes sense after a 
while. Or maybe it&#x27;s just because I made it up, is why it makes 
sense to me.
Kind of like my 4x4x4 solution. The algorithm to pair up the edges 
is long and confusing, and the edges need to be in exactly the right 
place in relation to each other. And no one else understands it so 
far but me. :)

In the process of looking at the PLL algorithms for memorization, I noticed the odds in which each case will come up in terms of 288. With a little thinking, I figured out how they got 288.<br>
288 = (4!4!)/2<br>
I can see where (4!)^2 came from. There are 4! different permutations possible for corners and the same goes for edges. However, I know dividing by two has something to do with the limits on how the permutations can come up. Why 2? Or is it 2 factorial?<br>
And how did they get the odds like 16/288 and 4/288? I should read up on combinatorics :)<br>

There&#x27;s some in Cardinal Arithmetic, since you&#x27;re up for it. : )

Rubik&#x27;s cube, on the other hand, is a puzzle, that many people 
consider hard. The c hallenge here is to solve it completely by 
yourself. If you were lost in nn the woods with nothing but a Rubik&#x27;s 
cube, you should still silve it. And may I remind you that the woods 
is not a nastural habitat for computers? (Unless you have a laptop

          <div class="email-content">I think the reaso nthat so many people here are memorizing it is 
because it helps improve the memory. Speed cubers need a good memory 
for algorithms, which makes sense as to why you don&#x27;t need to do it. 
Because you don&#x27;t memorize algorithms for artwork.
I don&#x27;t think you do, do you?

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I can see why you needto memorize algorithms for speedcubing.

Have you seen my designs  in http://cube.misto.cz ? Because they are 
3 dimensional, one cube has to contribute to more than one face of a 
design. This makes matters bit more complicated than for 2 d dezigners
who worry about just one face. Non-cubical designs ar still more 
complicated. What I do to avoid needless mewmorization is to build 
patterns on individual cubes from sequences, and those I memorize. 
There is also color control  that insures proper match from cube to 
cube. That you don&#x27;t memorize.
Keep in mind that cube artists are cubists. They cannot afford not to 
be. You don&#x27;t have to solve the cube in seconds. However, if it takes 
too long, you don&#x27;t get much cube art done.

          <div class="email-content">So you probably know alot of algorithms to make patterns on the 
cubes, right? I know a few, like the tic-tac-toe one, the O&#x27;s, the 
H&#x27;s, diagonal lines, etc. Those ones are simple.
I like the pattern where it&#x27;s a cube in a cube in a cube. But I don&#x27;t 
know how to make that one yet.

          <div class="email-content">If you  mean what I call the six-0 pattern,  you are partially right. 
4-0 pattern on opposite faces is very easy, but the 2-9 pattern on 
opposite faces is impossible. However, you can make a 6-0 pattern on 
adjacent faces. I use those as corners and edges for the Menger 
Sponge, which appears to be the favorite of some club members. :-) 
This, of course, makes the Sponge 3-color design.
That&#x27;s another thing you speedcubists don&#x27;t worry much 
about...opposite vs. adjacent faces and color schwmes.

he tic-tac-toe pattern onopposite faces is extremely easy. It is 
lesss easy on adjacent faces. Did you know that you can do H on 
opposite and adjecent faces? If the cube within a cube within a cube 
is what *I* think it is, then I use that as a corner for Jarmila 
design.

However, I know dividing by two has something to do with the limits

What is the difference between Lars&#x27; and Fridrich&#x27;s last layer?  Anything??  Or is it just the F2L different or...?   (I haven&#x27;t really looked into the Petrus system) :(<br>

          <div class="email-content">With the Petrus system, you orient all the edges before the final layer. Then, you swap two corners, orient corners (not need for edges.. already oriented), then permutate edges.<br>
<br>
With the Fridrich method you orient the whole LL and then permutate the whole LL. <br>
<br>
The Petrich method you ignore the swaping of two corners (and maybe orientation of edges if you know all OLL algorithms) and solve the LL like the Fridrich method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Petrich... Never thought of it that way...
But if you ask me, a LL is a LL. You can solve it any way you want. 
But of course the Petrus method does have the edges oriented 
already, so you can orient corners, permute corners, permute edges, 
or you can orient AND permute corners, permute edges, or you can 
orient corners, permute corners AND edges, or do all three with the 
Petrus method. I don&#x27;t know anyone who does all three, though. It 
would be pretty cool, because there can&#x27;t be more than a couple 
hundred algorithms. So if you could do the F2L Petrus method, then 
do the LL in one alg, that would probably be a less than 16 second 
average! I think.

That works for me, but I&#x27;ve also heard that Studio Cubes have 
excellent stickers. And you can get cubes with the plastic colored, 
so there are no stickers, but those kinds are awwwful.

          <div class="email-content">I tried Gilles&#x27; idea and it works great for me.  I used super glue 
since I couldn&#x27;t find neoprene glue.  I cut out little squares from 
colored plastic dividers and super-glued them on my cube.  Now I 
don&#x27;t have to worry about the stickers.  They have stayed in good 
shape so far (a few weeks).

          <div class="email-content">Today I broke the 3:00 minute barrier with my megaminx.  I must say, I love this puzzle, lots and lots of fun.  My average was 3:30.82  with my best time being 2:57.55.  Only good enough for 5th or so on speedcubing.com, but still, admirable I think.  And a huge thanks to Mr. Grant Tregay for helping out, sharing pointers and such.<br>
<br>
One question, is there a standard color scheme for these?  When I got mine it was only a 6 color version, stickered.  So I pealed off the stickers that hadn&#x27;t fallen off already and painted it 12 colors: white/yellow, green/blue, orange/red, pink/purple, grey/black, neon green/neon orange.<br>

At any rate... yay!<br>

I bought a cube last week and lubed it by taking out one of the edge pieces and spraying silicon spray into the cube. It worked pretty good; not quite as good as I wanted, but it was decent.  After a week of heavy usage, it got a little &quot;rusty&quot; so I wanted to lube it again.  This time I took apart the whole cube and sprayed each piece and the middle piece.  Then I set them down for about 15 minutes and then put the cube back together.  For some reason now my cube is slower than it was before.  The faces don&#x27;t move freely....like if I turn it by putting a little pressure on, it doesn&#x27;t turn freely instead it kinda jumps a few times.  Whats going on?<br>

I think you just used too much lube. Either take it apart and dab it a
bit with a cloth, or work it out, which takes about a week.

Actually, time you use has been updated, but the new version can&#x27;t be <br>

<br>
&gt;I finally made a video of myself solving the cube. I couldn&#x27;t upload<br>
&gt;it to the files section, because there seems to be no file space<br>
&gt;left. Here&#x27;s a link to a zip file:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I only had a few tries not warmed up, so the time 16.5 seconds was<br>
&gt;not too bad at all. The quality is not very good, and you can&#x27;t see<br>
&gt;exactly what is happening to the cube, but I&#x27;ll try to fix a better<br>
&gt;video some time in the summer.<br>
&gt;Enjoy the speedcubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, Ron is right, I used odd pairs quite rarely as the extra 
thinking time doesn&#x27;t seem to quite compensate for the decreased 
number of moves. About 1 cube in 5 could use odd pairs quite 
adequately but half of those are just as good with normal pairs so 
only 1 cube in 10 is this worth doing on.
That was in reply to:

>(I think Olly also uses odd pairs, but when I asked Ron about this 
he said he only does so very rarely.)

Anyway, that said, I think being able to do odd pairs is
a) cool
b) useful for the final pair or the first pair
c) not useful for the middle 2 pairs (too hard to keep track and 
retain fluency for the last pair)
d) a good way to reduce moves in the F2L

Certainly, people should try it (you will have a few more cubes which 
are &#x27;lucky&#x27;), but don&#x27;t expect your times to tumble.

I do agree with your point about encountering your best algorithms 
meaning that you were lucky, but you still have to have performed it.

My pb is 12 as opposed to an average of 22, and it required a full 
solution just I saw it really easily and didn&#x27;t fumble. I sort of 
regard it as a bit lucky in that respect, but in other peoples eyes 
it is just a normal cube. I have a clutch of 13/14/15 all the same.

Also, some people strive to get fast cubes whereas other people have 
been more striven to good averages hence the faster times may be by 
cubers who are slower on average just they took a lot of guesses that 
went right (instead of slowing down so that they could know for sure 
where the pieces were) and hence solved at fast speed.

If you fastest time is less than 2/3rds of your average then I guess 
you are guessing or going too fast too often to get consistent times 
but you will probably get more freak times. No rigorous mathematics 
for this just a general feeling.

I watched maybe the final ten minutes of Test the Nation on Fox (here in the USA). They said that the average IQ of females is 111 and for males is 113. Now, this looks a little fishy, eh? The average IQ is ALWAYS defined to be 100. They said during the show they calculated a norm and all that good stuff.<br>
<br>
a/x = 111 and b/y = 113<br>
Assume the average IQ is 100 (like it SHOULD be)<br>
100 = (a + b)/(x + y)<br>
100 = (111x + 113y)/(x+y)<br>
100x + 100y = 111x + 113y<br>
0 = 11x + 13y<br>
<br>
This means that for the average to be 100, the number of males or females HAS to be negative. Assuming that the number of females in the US equals the number of males, the average IQ would be 112.<br>
<br>
Is my thinking right? It seems Fox rigged the show just right so many people feel happy about themselves and will watch Fox more.<br>

Depends where you live. In the States there&#x27;s no &quot;and&quot;. In the UK it 
is. As to the possibility of confusion (mentioned in another post), 
if one can&#x27;t tell that seventy two is an integer and two thirds is 
not then one ought to be worried about other things than the 
presence, or otherwise, of a conjunction.

  One should not say &#x27;four hundred and seventy two&#x27;. The word &quot;and&quot; is used to represent a decimal place, like &quot;four and three tenths.&quot; <br>

I&#x27;d have to say I disagree entirely. Also, English is a Germanic 
language (i.e. it has its roots in German). Think about numbers in 
German if you will.

Vierhundertzweiundsiebzig.

Note the &quot;und&quot; for &quot;and&quot;.

The omission of the &quot;and&quot; is very much like the omission of the &quot;u&quot; 
in colour - it is an American convention.

(Besides, what if one is using a base other than ten? Then there can 
be no decimal place. Also, there is no decimal place in four and 
three tenths. Four point three would have a decimal place but four 
and three tenths does not. If we are to be really technical about 
things then fractions in the usual definition aren&#x27;t real numbers 
anyway (although there is an isomorphic copy embedded in the real 
numbers) so they don&#x27;t have decimal points.)

color, the person asking the question is either trying to be funny 
or is not thinking straight.

Does the US flag have a decimal place, then?

I suggest that it may help in blindfold cubing. (Not that one should 
use a loaded cube of course.)

prepared on one of the faces. It will go away naturally. Also, try 
to spray loads of lube into the problem axle, that usually helps.

Hey Grant,

  The usage I grew up with was that &quot;and&quot; spoken in a year was for
formal (read stuffy) situations, ala, &quot;The year of Our Lord One
Thousand Six Hundred and Thiry Five...blah, blah, and blah...&quot;

  Such usage in daily life (in the US) ala, &quot;Two Thousand and Three&quot;
smacks of putting on airs. However, the British are allowed such
things on account of the Beatles being cool and all. :)

          <div class="email-content">I hope to pick up the motivation to solve it sometime soon. Lately I have been too lazy to do anything. I have not speedcubed in a week and I have not memorized any new PLL algorithms yet. Shame on myself :-P Maybe a good nights rest will do... I have neglected sleep for a week.<br>
<br>
I am working out a solution method. I figure that if I am going to solve it layer-by-layer, I must first place the centers and then a corner and the edges around it in at the same time. It is all in theory.. in practice, I will see :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">i&#x27;ll add that the numerator (above the 288) is always an integer 
divisible by 4 because the last layer can end up in any of the 21 
permutations in one of 4 different LL rotational positions (since LL 
is 4-sided).

if you add up all the probabilities of all 21 permutations, you find 
you get 284/288, leaving 4/288 for the &quot;solved&quot; final layer.  
obviously there aren&#x27;t 4 ways to have the last layer 
already &quot;solved&quot;, but there is 1.solved, 2.solved but LL 90 ccw out, 
3. solved but LL 180 out, 4. solved but LL 90 cw out.

as for why it is half of 4!4! divided by 2, it sounds like you&#x27;re 
right-- it has to do with the fact that all 4!4! permutations are 
not reachable from a solved cube.  i am not sure of the exact 
logistics of why it is exactly &quot;half&quot; though.

take care, eric

However, I know dividing by two has something to do with the limits 
on how the permutations can come up. Why 2? Or is it 2 factorial?

Sure PI is really useless memorize, and there really is no need at all to know it in 100 digits.  Since i&#x27;m a kid, I like to learn new things and memorize it just for fun.  PI in a 100 digits memorized IS useless, but to me so are spicy pork rhines ;).  I hope to see your designs at the champs!<br>

Hehehe, you have to play it up though.  Slip it into conversation.  Like 
&quot;Yeah, how about that weather, it&#x27;s raining pretty hard eh?  Well, You know, 
this one time it was raining really hard, to kill time I became the 14th 
person in recorded history to solve a 4 dimensional rubik&#x27;s cube...&quot;  Well 
maybe a little less arrogant and obvious than that, but you get the drift 
;).

James, Applying the Petrus system is going to be difficult, but I have 
faith!  I would love to see your solution file if/when you succeed in this.  
Very very impressive!

          <div class="email-content">I had no problems applying the Petrus method to the 4D cube. But I 
thought it was easier (more moves) to solve it using an extended 
edges first method. I usually solve it by doing the 24 centers, 32 
edges, then the 16 corners. I have an abundance of edge preserving 
corner algorithms, each of which translates into several 4D 
algorithms. Solving the edges took care though and was fun. I think 
it is harder then a 20x20x20 cube, but then again, the 3^4 has much 
more combinations.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m learning those same algorithms, but I&#x27;m not up to Y yet. I had 
that problem with F, that my fingers couldn&#x27;t do it very well. Just 
practice them and find the one you like the best, and do it slowly 
until your fingers pick it up. Then eventually you should know it 
reeaally well.
I also find it helps to use an algorithm that doesn&#x27;t turn very many 
faces, so the second one would be my first choice because it only 
turns the L face, the U face, and the F face, then the B face at the 
end. The first one uses R, B, U, D, and L, and the third one uses B, 
L, R, and U. But that&#x27;s just my humble opinion.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, James is onto something.  What I&#x27;ve done and seems to be working <br>
out nicely is to take the the X axis and then the Y axis as it&#x27;s <br>
shown in the picture on jessica fridrich&#x27;s page.  Or more simple, <br>
reflected over the diagonal axis from the top left to bottom right of <br>
the picture.  Anyway, that gives you the same move essentially but <br>
it&#x27;s easier for me because I&#x27;m right handed.<br>

Using the second listed algorithm I now do:<br>

If memorizing PI turns you on, go right ahead and memorize it. I mean 
it is usless to memorize such numbers, because no profit is gained 
from  it (except, maybe ntellectual satisfaction, which is very 
relative). But as I said, if it urns you on, it&#x27;s certainly fine with 
me.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to exhibit all the designs I made, 
because I don&#x27;t have enough cubes. :-( I wil show some pictures, but 
that is not the same as showing actual pieces. I hope to show 
Vasarely, Landry Staircase and the very simple Design for Pedestrians 
as actual designs,

          <div class="email-content">Eventhough there have been alot of posts about timers lately im <br>
making yet another one.  <br>
<br>
Ever since Dan Knights posted his Cube timer i&#x27;ve been using it <br>
about 90% of the time.  I really like it for a couple reasons.  <br>
Number one being how you start the timer.  I like it because you <br>
dont have to worry about starting before or after the timer actually <br>
starts.  The other thing I really like is that it copies all your <br>
times so you can just paste them into a word document.  <br>
<br>
Here are a couple ideas I have just come up with, i&#x27;d like to know <br>
if they are possible.  If anyone has some free time and is willing <br>
to put it together I think it would be awesome.<br>
<br>
I like the layout of Jess&#x27;s timer, so something like that would be <br>
good.  I would want the option to have a countdown like jess&#x27;s <br>
timer, with the beeping to tell you when to start.  Also i&#x27;d want <br>
the option to start the timer by releasing the space bar, just like <br>
on Dan&#x27;s timer.  This timer would also have to be able to calculate <br>
averages and keep track of times.  Now the new idea for the timer... <br>
It would be nice to just have a continuous log file for the times.  <br>
I have a program(messenger plus 2) for MSN messenger that logs <br>
everything said during the chat.  It saves it all in a notepad <br>
document.  So the cube log could be about the same thing, but since <br>
sometimes you have a piece pop and things like that i&#x27;d like to just <br>
be able to hit a button that would automatically paste the times and <br>
date into a notepad document, after I complete an average.<br>
<br>
ok enough of my pointless babble.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The only problem I have with Mr. Bonde&#x27;s timer is that I cannot save the times. Once I clicked the wrong button and I lost 11 times.. I was one short of an average.. :( I guess that is what one gets with an HTML &quot;program.&quot; Someone can write one in C/C++ or even in Visual Basic. I could write on in VB, but I forgot about 90% of it...<br>

          <div class="email-content">What I found out works is two things:<br>
1) Run the algorithm over and over again... like after you do it once.. from that state the cube is in, do it again.. repeat step one. After a few times.. the cube will return to the solved state.<br>
2) On your computer, write out the algorithm. Then using the spacebar and delete key if necessary, space out the algorithm into subalgorithsm that make sense. For example...<br>
LU&#x27;RD2R&#x27;UL&#x27;RU&#x27;LD2L&#x27;UR&#x27; = [LU&#x27;R  D2  R&#x27;UL&#x27;][RU&#x27;L  D2  L&#x27;UR&#x27;]<br>
Run that on a solved cube... to me, it is a lot easier to solve. I can make sense of the algorithm and I broke it into easy-to-remember chunks. With brackets it also shows I can remember half of the algorithm! If I wanted to, I can perform the first bracket, turn the cube around 180 degrees and do it again.<br>

Like everyone else has said...

1. Try several different algs or the situation.( so that you find 
the one that fits your fingers the best)
2. Break the alg down into finger tricks that you can easily 
remember, then learn the move with your hands( dont learn the 
notation...&quot;R2 B L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27;&quot; or whatever)
3. practice, practice, practice! (until you dont have to even think 
about the moves and still do them TOP speed!!!)

&gt; I do agree with your point about encountering your best algorithms <br>
&gt; meaning that you were lucky, but you still have to have performed it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My pb is 12 as opposed to an average of 22, and it required a full <br>
&gt; solution just I saw it really easily and didn&#x27;t fumble. I sort of <br>
&gt; regard it as a bit lucky in that respect, but in other peoples eyes <br>
&gt; it is just a normal cube. I have a clutch of 13/14/15 all the same.<br>
<br>
I think &quot;luck&quot; comes not only from being able to skip a step, or<br>
encountering your best algorithms, but also just finding that all the<br>
pieces you need for the next step are right in front of your eyes, and<br>
in a good position (particularly in the &quot;intuitive&quot; parts of your<br>
solution where genuine thinking time is spent).<br>
<br>
But standing back from all the technical reasons, these &quot;This was not a<br>
lucky time...&quot; records that shave 40% off their average time look a bit<br>
funny :-)<br>
<br>
Not to say that these records are invalid, of course. I hope one day I<br>
can achieve those times while performing the full extent of my solution.<br>
I just think we are using the word &quot;lucky&quot; in an unusual way (maybe we<br>
could just say &quot;I performed the full extent of my solution&quot;, instead of<br>
&quot;This was not lucky&quot;??).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would also break it down further because steps of 2s and 3s are 
very simple to plug into your short term memory.  like:
[(LU&#x27;R)  D2  (R&#x27;UL&#x27;)][(RU&#x27;L)  D2  (L&#x27;UR&#x27;)]

Looking at it you can find similarities that also helps you 
rememberit better like in (#1 ) and (#3)  Are the same except the L 
and R are switched.  same with (#2) and (#4)  This little blurps 
arent neccesary but they help me :)

There&#x27;s an optimal solver built in to Cube Explorer that you can <br>
enable.  Just click the little &quot;optimal&quot; box in the solver window.  <br>
The default solver is indeed the fast two-phase solver; the optimal <br>

I&#x27;d reveal the details but they are pretty much the same as any other <br>
implementation of God&#x27;s algorithm (see the source for the optimal <br>
solver in Cube Explorer, or Reid&#x27;s solver).  I just choose different <br>
groups, hash table sizes, and the like.<br>
<br>
If anyone&#x27;s interested I can make source available, but it does <br>
require about 700 MB of RAM, and the input is not the colors of the <br>
facelets, but rather a sequence of moves.  And it requires about an <br>
hour to precompute a large hashtable the first time you run it.  And <br>
there&#x27;s absolutely no UI (it&#x27;s completely command-line driven).<br>

The 2-phase algorithm uses an intermediate subset G1=&lt;U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2>
. Of course, a solved cube belongs to G1, but phase 1 does not look at
every sub-optimal (there are faster sequences that bring the scrambled
cube to G1) solutions.

BUT, there&#x27;s an optimal solver too, based on a different strategy:

Wow, lots of input.  Thanks for all the tips, they help a lot.  I had this one algorithm that I had &quot;memorized&quot; but sometimes I would forget it.  But I started thinking of it as a series of finger tricks, and now I don&#x27;t forget it anymore. Breaking the algs up more helps a lot too.  Thanks again.

Ryan,

   There was nothing lucky about that 24.27. It was one of 16 sub 30
second solves.

   I didn&#x27;t count that 24.27 in any average.

   If you wish to be so strict about &quot;lucky&quot; why not count any solve
which involved an algorithm that you learned from someone else?

<br>
Well, it seems that lucky is a pretty broad word, and there&#x27;s bound to<br>
be something lucky about it. If he&#x27;s one of your fastest times, I&#x27;m sure<br>
he feels lucky :-) If you had said it was non-lucky in just one<br>
particular respect (for example, that you did not skip a step), I&#x27;d<br>
understand.<br>
<br>
&gt;    If you wish to be so strict about &quot;lucky&quot; why not count any solve<br>
&gt; which involved an algorithm that you learned from someone else?<br>
<br>
I am trying to make the definition simpler, not more complicated!<br>
<br>
Here is the current definition of lucky time published in the &quot;rules&quot;<br>
section of the speedcubing.com records pages:<br>
<br>
| A lucky time is any time you solve the puzzle and a step (3 or<br>
| more moves) of your normal solution is skipped.  There are three<br>
| exceptions: 1) You worked for it, f.i. by anticipating the next<br>
| step. 2) The chance to skip the step is 20 percent or more. 3)<br>
| The skipped step represents 2 percent or less of the total moves<br>
| of the complete solution.  Example: if you use the<br>
| cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system, then there are 7 steps, and skipping<br>
| one of the steps would be a lucky case.  For blindfold solving a<br>
| lucky case is defined by: 1) no corners to be twisted and/or 2)<br>
| no edges to be flipped and/or 3) two or more corners correctly<br>
| placed in upper or lower layer and/or 4) more than two middle<br>
| layer edges already in middle layer.<br>
<br>
I propose that we replace that with something simpler, like:<br>
<br>
| A lucky time is any time that is &quot;X percent&quot; faster than your<br>
| average time.<br>
<br>
Or even just replace &quot;X percent&quot; with &quot;significantly faster&quot;, &quot;much<br>
faster&quot;, or &quot;*way* faster&quot; and let people&#x27;s guilt decide :-)<br>
<br>
The advantage this has over the previous definition is that it is fair<br>
to all varieties of solving methods. The previous definition is unfair<br>
to some methods in which you would have to be unlucky to encounter all<br>
of your steps - the 20% threshold hasn&#x27;t been proven to be fair on all<br>
methods with different numbers and sizes of steps. Also, the previous<br>
definition doesn&#x27;t apply to methods that have no clear steps.<br>
<br>
Note: this definition is all about &quot;time&quot;, as it should be since it is<br>
a definition for &quot;lucky time&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think a definition for &quot;lucky solution&quot; would also be useful, for<br>
example, to use instead of &quot;lucky time&quot; on the 3x3x3 fastest time page.<br>
It would speak in terms of the length of move sequences instead of the<br>
length of time, so a &quot;record time for a non-lucky solution&quot; would be<br>
when your solution had enough moves or steps, but you were able to<br>
recognise and execute them more quickly than other non-lucky solutions.<br>
The previous definition for &quot;lucky time&quot; is sort of like a definition<br>
for &quot;lucky solution&quot;. Maybe it can be used as a starting point.<br>
<br>
So, it seems important to be specific about what we mean by lucky:<br>
whether it be a lucky time or a lucky solution. To say &quot;this record was<br>
not lucky&quot; is slightly ambiguous. When someone says &quot;this time was not<br>
lucky&quot; and they really mean &quot;this solution was not lucky&quot;, it can be<br>
misleading. I had not realised until now these two distinct meanings of<br>
lucky, but it seems to clear up any misunderstandings if we make the<br>
distinction.<br>
<br>
Just food for thought.<br>

I have three more:
F R L2 U&#x27; R2 L&#x27; U&#x27; D2 R2 F D B D F2 U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F2 D2 L2  (20f*)
U R B U L F U2 F2 D B2 U&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D2 R U B D&#x27; R2 U&#x27;  (20f*)
L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; L F L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; U F&#x27; D U B&#x27; F R&#x27; U&#x27;  (20f*)
These are also highly symmetric patterns, though not quite as 
symmetric as the superflip. These are superflip+supertwist patterns, 
possibly with a 6H or 6X edge pattern thrown in.

Jaap

P.S.
Superflip= pattern where all 12 edges are flipped but not otherwise 
moved.
Supertwist= pattern where all 8 corners are twisted (adjacent corners 
in opposite directions) but not moved out of position.

   I placed every piece, nothing just fell into place. No steps were
skipped. I understood everything I did. I earned this time, especially
since it was the culmination of a lot of work. All the differnt things
I&#x27;m working on came together.

   If you performed the full extent of Lars&#x27; or Jessica&#x27;s solution
it&#x27;s not your solution, is it? Some people were lucky to find all the
algs that other people developed. What would their times be if not for
other&#x27;s work?

   This is an terrible idea. Deleting *way* faster times from
someone&#x27;s stats isn&#x27;t fair at all, espescially for arbitrary reasons,
i.e. they&#x27;re 40% faster. As individuals get faster these spikes
happen, and they are important in showing the cubist that they can
improve...and often *how* to improve.
    
> The advantage this has over the previous definition is that it is

unfair to some methods in which you would have to be unlucky to
encounter all of your steps - the 20% threshold hasn&#x27;t been proven to
be fair on all methods with different numbers and sizes of steps.
Also, the previous definition doesn&#x27;t apply to methods that have no
clear steps.

    Yes. If I went by that definition I could claim a 13.25 as my
non-lucky time, as the 20% that fell into place was my hardest 20%.

page. It would speak in terms of the length of move sequences instead
of the length of time, so a &quot;record time for a non-lucky solution&quot;
would be when your solution had enough moves or steps, but you were
able to recognise and execute them more quickly than other non-lucky
solutions. The previous definition for &quot;lucky time&quot; is sort of like a
definition for &quot;lucky solution&quot;. Maybe it can be used as a starting
point. &lt;

   Since everyone may apply the scramble differently, then a
particular scramble can favor some solutions more than others. Suppose
we used the same solutions, if you start on white and I start on blue
the scramble may favor you simply from where you started.

   I suggested for a solving contest to apply the same scramble all 24
ways and solve them all. What are the chances that one or more of
these would be lucky? Eventually a cubist could learn to recognize the
shorter solves, but that takes the ability to start on any side.

   Eventually this would lead to a higher and higher proportion of
&quot;lucky&quot; solves.

  I got no feedback about that idea so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any
interest.

be misleading. I had not realised until now these two distinct

we make the distinction.

   Neither the time nor the solution was lucky. :)

Sorry, what I meant to say was that an alternative to coming up with a
better definition of lucky would be to avoid using the word lucky in a
vague sense, and use more specific words instead - in each case a
different adjective would be appropriate.

Your interesting point aside, you must be agreeing with me that the term
&quot;lucky&quot; is vague. People should say what specifically is lucky or
non-lucky about their record, if they want to use the word at all,
otherwise it can be misinterpreted (even in the way that you just
pointed out, but perhaps not as likely ;-)

Ok, you&#x27;ve seen the negative possibilities are many. I&#x27;m not interested
in those applications. You seem to be thinking that I wish to apply the
constraint that all records in all categories must not be &quot;lucky times&quot;.
This is not the case. I was merely attempting to clarify what &quot;lucky
time&quot; means and suggest that we only use that specific term when that&#x27;s
what we really mean (for example, in somebody&#x27;s personal record
description). Specifically, I don&#x27;t think we should be saying &quot;this was
not a lucky time&quot;, if we really mean &quot;this was not a lucky solution&quot;, or
&quot;I skipped no steps of my solution&quot;, or something else.

Additionally, I am suggesting that the constraint on the &quot;3x3x3 fastest
times&quot; records list be changed from excluding lucky times to excluding
lucky solutions. That would more accurately describe how people are
currently using that list (whereas currently, the casual observer may be
mislead into thinking that these were not lucky, but typical times)

Maybe you&#x27;re lucky.

Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t resist ;-)

If you solve a single scramble from 24 angles, maybe your chances of
getting a lucky solve would increase by roughly the same amount as if
you had solved 24 different scrambles, assuming all scrambles are
random. I wonder? I suppose it is a useful to solve the same scramble
in 24 ways if you are attempting the Fewest Moves Contest.

(In the current FMC rules, you are allowed unlimited attempts, so
attempting the same scramble in many ways would increase your chances of
getting a lucky solution (most people&#x27;s technique?). As I said before, I
think it would be fair to have separate record lists for those who use
unlimited attempts, and those who use a single attempt. But back to your
idea...)

Just a point of interest: I am able to solve the cube starting from any
angle, and can find the optimal solution to the first step or two.
However, and although you can rarely foresee this, sometimes suboptimal
solutions to the first part can lead to better overall solutions, as is
demonstrated by Herbert Kociemba&#x27;s 2 phase algorithm. The algorithm
starts out with an optimal solution to the first phase, and this usually
leads to an overall solution of between 25 and 30 moves (I think). Then
it continues to blindly test suboptimal solutions for the first phase,
and by chance (not intelligence), the overall solution quickly drops
down to about 20 moves in length. Why does the algorithm use chance here
instead of intelligence? Apart from the fact that it gives results
sooner, perhaps you would need to have God&#x27;s intelligence and God&#x27;s
algorithm (or just a fast computer with the combined intelligence of
many humans - see Mike Reid&#x27;s optimal solver) to look that far ahead in
reasonable time.

I think your idea is interesting if you want to find out the best
performance you can get out of any particular scramble. I think if you
do that, you will benefit from luck (for example, if one of the worst
openings turned out to lead to the best overall solve of 24), but you
may also learn how to find the best start from any angle. Best starts
are still useful, because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got - you can&#x27;t
realistically look ahead to the end of the whole solution. On the hand,
maybe some day sombody will achieve the impossible... Tony Snyder seems
to think it is possible.

If you&#x27;re only interested in the average, maybe 24 random scrambles is
just as effective.

I am guilty of imposing my definition of luck on you. What do you mean
when you say &quot;lucky time&quot;? Is it just that the time threshold is
different, or does your definition include many variables (like steps
skipped) that are specific to your own solving style?

The best(?) example is Adam Géhin:

- 8 months later, his best average is 17.6 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all! Just got back from vacation in California. It gave me a lot <br>
of plane time to memorize algorythems and stuff. Well a day or so <br>
before I left I took an average. My time was 1:01 with a new fastest <br>
time of :43. So I spent the down time of vacation working on <br>
memorizing and F2L stuff. On the plane ride back I decided to take a <br>
new average. My average came to :47.3 with a new fastest time of :37 <br>
seconds (done with a second hand of a watch so pinpoint times might <br>
not be accurate). To put this in a sense that everyone can understand <br>
that would be like droping 25% of your time in a week. I was <br>
wondering, does anyone eles have this kind of progress before the get <br>
really fast? My studio cube came in while I was on vacation so I&#x27;m <br>
going to get working on that now. Have a great day!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I got a 70% drop in my time. I went from 5 minutes to 90 seconds in one week. Then, I went to 1:10 in a week from 90 seconds. That is a 22.2% drop. From there on... I am cubes much less than I did in the first 4 weeks. Mainly because cubing is the same thing over and over again except with the fact that I get really fast. I dropped from 60 seconds to 53 seconds in 5 days merely by making one step of the method I use much more consistent.<br>
<br>
I still average 53 seconds. I should be in the averaging 40 seconds right now, but I don&#x27;t cube as much as I should. I am working on increasing my motivation level :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Silicone spray works /awesomely/. I don&#x27;t think that Vaseline works, 
there was a post here on it before. But I forgot what it said 
exactly. :)
But I would recommend Silicone Spray, you can get it at a drug store 
or something.

Thanks, but does anyone know the series of moves that will get you 
to the superflip/supertwist posions? I can do the superflip on my 
own, but I don&#x27;t have a set algorithm for it, so it takes about 50 
moves.

<br>
Someone posted a sequence that you perform twice and it does it.<br>
<br>
In Cube Explorer, you can set the &quot;scrambled&quot; state such that all the edges are flipped and then reverse the algorithm it gives (I did it once and was able to do it without reversing...). I think I got a 20 move sequence.<br>

Why reverse it? It is a move of order 2.

Superflipping the cube from a solved state is reversing all the edge cubies<br>
<br>
Solving the cube from a superflipped state is reversing all the edge cubies<br>
<br>
So the same algorithm will do both.<br>
<br>
An algorithm of order two is one which when applied twice to a solved <br>
cube will solve it again:<br>
<br>
R2<br>
<br>
R&#x27;L&#x27; U2 RL FB U2 F&#x27;B&#x27;<br>
<br>
The superflip algorithm will work like that: any edge flipping algorithm <br>
  is orger two, moste corner flipping algorithms are order 3. The useful <br>
thing about an order 2 sequence is that both it and it&#x27;s reverse have <br>
the same effect. This is good if you can&#x27;t get your fingers to work well <br>
one way.<br>
<br>
Am I correct in saying that any algorithm is of a finite order? Is there <br>
any method to calculate this order without just repeating it until a <br>
solve comes?<br>

Yes on both of these - since the cube group is finite every element
has finite order. (There are also infinite groups where every element
has finite order. Off the top of my head, I&#x27;d imagine that an infinite
dimensional version of a rubik cube could give such a group but, if
not, it is trivial to come up with examples anyway such as a direct
product of infinitely many torsion groups.)
In fact, this has come up before.
If you work in the group generated by &lt;U,D,F,B,R,L> then any element
has order at most 1260.
Ron found a move of higher order, as I recall, but he was working in
&lt;U,D,F,B,R,L,M,E,S> which is a different group.

There&#x27;s no element of order p for any prime higher than 11 since the
cyclic subgroup generated by an element must divide the order of the
group by Lagrange&#x27;s theorem and the order of the group is not
divisible by any prime higher than 11.

It&#x27;s esy to see that the exponent of the group is 2^4*3^2*5*7*11 so
any order would have to divide that.
Even so the highest order of an element is less than the exponent for
this group.

          <div class="email-content">Yes. What you are referring to is what I call cyclicity in my book. 
Any algorithm will produce an element of RCG (Rubik&#x27;s Cube Group)/ 
Certain of those elemrnts, when done in suddession on a clean cube, 
will produce the clean cube again. tHE NUMBER OF TIMES THIS IS DONE 
IS CALLED THE ALGORITHM&#x27;S CYCLICITY.

but it makes sense to me.  Coul you explain why those two shouldn&#x27;t 
be the same order? UF is just a horizontal reflection of UF&#x27;.  And 
it seems to me that any two intersecting faces rotated in this 
manner could either be a rotation of the cube or reflection across 
the cube, or rotation +reflection  of UF. UR would just be UF after 
rotating the intire cube in a U&#x27; manner, UF&#x27; would be a reflection 
of UF.  So it makes sense to me that any combination of a single 
quarter turn on two separate, intersecting faces regardless of the 
direction of the turn (as long as it&#x27;s consistent) should all be of 
the same order, and in this case 63 repititions...

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s plenty of people here who started out solving at several 
minute averages. When I joined, I struggled to get under a minute, 
but now my average is 30 seconds.
First of all, what method are you using? Your cube also needs to be 
lubricated. See www.speedcubing.com/ton to learn how to do that. If 
you have a method with a First two layers and then a last layer, then 
solve the F2L slowly, make sure to look ahead, then speed up at the 
LL. Hope that makes sense....

          <div class="email-content">Hi, welcome to the club. When I joined about 3 months ago I was about <br>
1:30 now my fastest average is 47.3 and about to change after I got <br>
some silicone spray for my studio cube. I&#x27;ve been building up <br>
beginner tips in my head for awhile now and now I think it&#x27;s time to <br>
write them down for you. 1) Start with an off-brand cube, don&#x27;t get a <br>
fancy 20$ cube yet. 2) Don&#x27;t put silicone spray, vasoline, or any <br>
other lubricant. These first 2 steps will force you to slow down and <br>
not get ahead of yourself, learning to look ahead. 3) Start with a <br>
simple layer by layer method w/ a 4 step last layer. You can slowly <br>
translate that into a 2 step last layer and a very efficiant first <br>
two layers. 4) Learn the bulk of the first two layers on your own. <br>
That way you will be genuinely intutative with your solution. That <br>
does not include the last layer which you should learn patterns for. <br>
5) Listen to all the more expierenced cubers when they give tips ( <br>
not just me but everyone) the faster that you realize that they <br>
REALLY know what their talking about, the better off you&#x27;ll be (this <br>
attitude generally arises when you are switching to more efficiant <br>
methods (ex: &quot;that won&#x27;t be too much faster than my solution right <br>
now)) My average number of face moves was about 130 when I started, <br>
now my average is somewhere in the low 50&#x27;s. 6) 7) The most important <br>
tip : PRATICE, PRATICE, PRATICE. On you&#x27;re journey to &quot;sub-whatever&quot; <br>
you will spend a lot of time looking for tips and ideas. That is good <br>
to a cirtian extent but eventually you just need to sit down and do <br>
it. <br>
        Thanks for listening to my long-winded explination. Here are <br>
some abreviations in the club that you might not understand:<br>
<br>
F2L-First Two Layers<br>
LL-Last Layer<br>
OLL- Orientation of Last Layer (used in the 2 step last layer <br>
solution)<br>
PLL- Premutation of the Last Layer ( &quot;                 &quot;)<br>
<br>
The only other thing that I can offer is that you WILL get there. And <br>
never be afraid to ask. There&#x27;s no such thing as a stupid question.<br>

&gt;[I was amazed when I found out that all the orders have such short<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, that is so true James, and is an important thing to notice. You will improve your cubing with practice, and you will tend to find that you improve in jumps, it won&#x27;t necessarily be a gradual process. But the number one thing I have learnt in my quest to go faster, is to not try too hard. You would think to go fast you need to perform finger tricks exceedingly quick, do the moves as fast as you can, rush the LL etc. But in fact the opposite is true. If you take your time and relax, your mind will function much better, you will be able to concentrate more on the cube solution, and less of your brain will be devoted to thinking about going fast. When you try to go fast, you will inevitably encounter cube lock-ups, even on the best cubes, and these will slow you down immensely. So the moral is to go slow if you want to be fast, your solutions will be more fluent, and therefore end up being quicker in the long run!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have one of these cubes, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a bad cube in the least.  I&#x27;ve dropped it twice though and broken 2 middle cubies, but I superglued them back together and the cube is buttery smooth.  The easiest gliding cube (of any size) I own.  The stickers on my are kinda annoying though, as the red and orange as well as the blue and green look almost identical under anything but sunlight...  Just my $0.02USD!<br>

That is of order 4. Of course any single face turn is the shortest <br>
order 4 move sequence.<br>
The shortest of order 3 may be R2U2R2U2.<br>

Hi Matthew, welcome to the club.

How are you currently solving the cube?  Do you start with a face? corners? 
something else?  then what?

Is your cube lubricated?

S.

PS Also, when you say that you taught yourself, does that mean that the 
moves you are doing are ones that you have figured out all on your own?  
just interested ...

cubes to create designs. Often, when I was struggling with stiff

&gt;I currently solve it layer by layer.<br>
&gt;1. Top Layer - Edges then corners<br>
&gt;2. Middle Layer - Edges<br>
&gt;3. Bottom layer - Corners then edges<br>
<br>
OK, starting with the first two steps of your current method: if you sort of <br>
came up with a layer-by-layer method on your own, my recommendation is to <br>
have a look at Jessica&#x27;s system.  Her F2L system is brilliant, although I <br>
find it easier to follow the algorithms for this part of the solution at <br>
www.speedcubing.com then on her own pages.<br>
<br>
But here is a way you can do the F2L much faster and without learning any <br>
new algorithms.  It is a key-hole system that combines part of step 1 and <br>
step 2 of your current method.  To get the feel for it, start with this:<br>
<br>
1. Top Layer - just to the edges (called a Cross)<br>
2. Insert 3 corners ONLY<br>
3. Using the free corner (the key-hole) insert 3 Middle edges.  You will <br>
find that this can be done by moving the face with the Cross on it around, <br>
so that the unsolved corner is underneath (assuming that the Cross is now <br>
the down face) the spot where you want the next-to-be-solved Middle Edge to <br>
be, and moving the LL (the up face) around so that the edge is next to it.  <br>
Then you can insert the edge using only three moves: if the edge is moving <br>
into FR then the moves will be either FU&#x27;F or RUR&#x27;.<br>
4. Insert your last corner<br>
5. Insert your last edge using the algorithms that  you are doing at the <br>
moment for your step 2<br>
<br>
This will be faster, but you can easily make it faster still, again with no <br>
extra algorithms, by doing this, which is the key-hole solution to the F2L <br>
proper:<br>
1. Cross<br>
2. 3 corners and 3 edges -- in any order (lots of free slots to start with)<br>
3. last corner<br>
4. last middle edge<br>
<br>
This can go pretty fast, because all the moves are triggers.  I think that <br>
this is a good way to start getting your mind into thinking of the F2L the <br>
way Jessica&#x27;s system solves it, too.<br>
<br>
For the LL, I presume you are doing a 4 looks system, corners first, then <br>
edges.  You can speed this up by moving towards a 3 look system, and finally <br>
a 2 look system. LL in two looks can take some time to learn, but moving <br>
from four looks to three looks is not so bad.  This link will help you do <br>
that, if you so desire:<br>
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#method<br>
<br>
Finally: lubricate your cube, using silicon spray.  That will take 10 <br>
seconds off, easy.  Do it, and you will wonder how you ever coped without <br>
it.  If I try and turn an unlubed cube I feel like my wrists are going to <br>
break.<br>
<br>
A lubed cube, keyhole method, and 4-look LL can get you sub-minute.  But I <br>
reckon before long will will want to drop the keyhole for F2L proper, aka <br>
Jessica&#x27;s system!<br>
<br>
Good luck!  About 12 months ago my personal best time was 82 seconds.  I now <br>
get lots of times between 20 and 30 seconds, and even one time of 14.98 <br>
seconds, so it is possible.<br>

First of all, what method are you using? Your cube also needs to be 
lubricated. See www.speedcubing.com/ton to learn how to do that. If 
you have a method with a First two layers and then a last layer, then 
solve the F2L slowly, make sure to look ahead, then speed up at the 
LL. Hope that makes sense....

<br>
I would recommend that before you start learning algorithms, you <br>
should learn how to perform triggers, if you haven&#x27;t already.  It&#x27;s <br>
much easier to learn algorithms with triggers already in place then <br>
to add them in later.  If you add them later, you almost need to <br>
relearn the algorithm.  Also, in knowing how to perform triggers, you <br>
can remember algorithms as sequences of finger tricks, instead of <br>
individual moves, making the memorization process a little easier.  <br>
However, for triggers to work, you may need to lubricate your cube <br>
first; it depends on just how stiff your cube really is.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s my recommendation for anyone that wants to go from cube <br>
illiterate to &quot;speed cubist&quot;:<br>
1) Learn to solve the cube (you&#x27;ve done this already!)<br>
2) Lube your cube<br>
3) Learn to perform triggers<br>
4) Assuming you learned a layer by layer approach, learn to do first <br>
layer corners and middle layer edges together.  This may mean working <br>
out your own method of &quot;line up corner &amp; edge&quot; and &quot;insert pair&quot; <br>
operations, or you can learn algorithms from plenty of different <br>
sources on the internet.<br>
5) Learn a four look LL - I would recommend orienting first in two <br>
steps (corners and edges, in either order), and then permuting <br>
(positioning) everything in two steps)Orient corners then edges (or <br>
vice versa), then permute (position) corners then edges (or vice <br>
versa).<br>
6) Learn additional permutation algs to get last layer down to 3 looks<br>
7) Learn additional orientation algs to get last layer down to 2 looks<br>
8) Practice, practice, practice...<br>
<br>
I think that most people find they waste the most time during their <br>
first two layers, even after learning all the algorithms.  However, I <br>
would say don&#x27;t worry about spending too much time on that part of <br>
your solution until you&#x27;ve at least gotten to a 4 look last layer.  <br>
Then after stage 5, 6, or 7 in the learning process (perhaps after <br>
each of them), I&#x27;d recommend taking time to teach yourself how to <br>
minimize pauses during the first two layers by really slowing down <br>
and looking ahead.  The reason I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this <br>
earlier, though, is partly because you need the moves for the F2L to <br>
be in your subconscious before you can really start looking ahead <br>
effectively.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently in stage 7 of the learning process.  I guess I&#x27;m a slow <br>
learner, but it&#x27;ll come eventually.  I&#x27;ve been averaging just over 30 <br>
seconds for a long time now, but I remember when I didn&#x27;t think I <br>
could do any better than about a minute and a half.  I think if/when <br>
I finally get all the OLL (orientation) algs into my head, and can <br>
perform them solidly, I&#x27;ll be able to shave at least 3-4 seconds off <br>
my average.  Then, I can really concentrate on the F2L.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I average 1.42 move/sec per solve. I solve the cube in 75 moves. I really should shorten that down. When I learn all the PLL cases, I will be to 64 moves per solve, solving the cube in 43 seconds (in theory). I am very slow in the beginning part of the solve. As I get closer to the LL, my speed increases to about 2.5 moves/sec. I believe my final step is 3 moves/sec.

          <div class="email-content">It is a finger trick that makes doing a short series of moves very fast. For instance, the move R-U-R&#x27; can be done by turning the right face, and while still holding it, flipping the up face with the index finger, then turning the R face anticlockwise while still holding it from before. (toungetwister)<br>
 <br>
Check out: http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/CubeInfo.html and click on finger tricks, triggers. Look around for other sites about finger tricks, there is some really good incite out there. Also check out, http://lar5.com/cube then click on physical at the bottom. It gives a great description and shows a video of Lars doing a seven move Sune in under a second. Great stuff.

          <div class="email-content">About 3 months ago I was averaging 81.83 moves/cube (my LL solution sucks):
7.48 moves for the cross
8.8 moves per f2l corner/edge pair (x 4 = 35.2 for F2L)
5.8 for OLL edges
6.87 for PLL Corners
13.045 for OLL Corners
13.438 for PLL edges  (39.153 for all LL)

So my method is not very efficient, but I&#x27;m having problems memorizing my new LL algys.  however with averages around 32-33 seconds, that&#x27;s about 2.5 turns/second, which is ok but not wonderful.  Those LL algs are a beast though, and hats off to all of you who have perfected a 2 step LL (or shorter)!

  I average 1.42 move/sec per solve. I solve the cube in 75 moves. I really should shorten that down. When I learn all the PLL cases, I will be to 64 moves per solve, solving the cube in 43 seconds (in theory). I am very slow in the beginning part of the solve. As I get closer to the LL, my speed increases to about 2.5 moves/sec. I believe my final step is 3 moves/sec.

Not quite as straightforward. You may have to multiply by 1, 2, 3 or 
6 depending on if corners and/or edges are twisted.

Depends if you&#x27;re American or not. &quot;Period&quot; is used in the USA.

I assume you are talking about during the first 2 layers, when a <br>
corner and edge are in their correct places, but the edge is <br>
flipped?  If this is the case, try this (hold the cube with your <br>
first layer on D, and the flipped edge in FR) :<br>
(R U R&#x27;) U2 (R U2) (R&#x27; U) (F&#x27; U&#x27; F)<br>

If you prefer the cross on the left, as I do, then do this (cross on <br>

(U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R2 U&#x27;) (R2 U) (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)<br>

In either case, it&#x27;s easier to perform with a cube rotation before <br>
the last 3 (for the first sequence) or 4 moves (for the second).<br>

Oh, unless you mean at *any point* in the sequence it goes back to <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well speaking as a top cuber... ;) hehe no, I am a fairly average speedcuber, averaging in the mid-twenties now. I have been meaning to take such a breakdown of my solutions for a while now, and since you asked, I thought what better time to do it but noe.<br>
<br>
Here is my breakdown:<br>
<br>
Step        Number of turns<br>
Cross        7.4<br>
F2L           30.5<br>
OLL          9.1<br>
PLL           12.9<br>
----------------------------<br>
Total         59.9<br>
<br>
I will at this time point out that a lot of the OLL and PLL cases were nasty, and so my average times would probably have been 1 or 2 sec higher than normal. So, assuming an average solve time of 28 secs, my turn/sec is 2.14. This also assumes that my solutions are fluent and constant, realistically I would estimate that I solve at around 3 turns/sec with pauses in between (especially with recognition of the PLL)<br>

  means i am only turning the cube 1.5 -2 turns a sec!!!  If i staayed <br>
  at a constent 2 turns a sec, then i&#x27;d be under 30 sec,  if i even <br>
  turned 3 turns a sec id be under 20!!!  So i guess my big poblem <br>
  isn&#x27;t my solution, its my recognition and speed!  But anyway, sorry <br>
  for the whole pathway of self discovery, i&#x27;d like to hear how many <br>
  turns per cube they make and itd be nice to hear a turn per sec ratio <br>
  too :)  Thanks for hearing me out<br>

please be advised that I am contemplating dropping the blindfold <br>
event as an actual &quot;event&quot; due to lack of entries..<br>
<br>
Our main blindfold specialists either cannot come or do not agree <br>
with rules etc for one reason or another.<br>
<br>
Decision will be made June 30th if we drop it as an actual event and <br>
just have it as a demonstration($ of course).<br>
<br>
Am a bit disappointed in the dropping out of our main guys and the <br>
web site rules are not finished yet therefore if we start loosing <br>
competitors for the blindfolding event at this time, I might as well <br>
drop it as an event before our promotions require changing.....We <br>
dont want to have to spend extra $ on promoting something that will <br>
not occur at the event.<br>

&gt; event as an actual &quot;event&quot; due to lack of entries..<br>
<br>
I just looked at the information on the blindfold cubing events, and <br>
I&#x27;m a little confused about the number of rounds and attempts per <br>
round.  Am I to understand that the first round in the 3x3x3 <br>
blindfold event will have 10 attempts?  According to the unofficial <br>
records, there are only 4 people that could do this in less that an <br>
hour.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you could get more participation if the first round was an <br>
elimination round, with only 1 required attempt, and 1-2 optional, <br>
additional attempts for contestants who want to try again.  Then, you <br>
could just base it on each person&#x27;s best time, and keep only people <br>
who can do it faster than a predetermined time or keep just a preset <br>
number of contestants.  Even later rounds could have just one <br>
required attempt and be based on best time.<br>
<br>
For the larger cubes, according to the unofficial records, it looks <br>
like a single attempt could take at least 1/2 hour (4x4x4) or 2 1/2 <br>
hours (5x5x5) per person!  With this amount of time put into a single <br>
attempt, I would think that this category could be based entirely on <br>
a single attempt, if the contestant is successful.  Again, maybe <br>
these categories should be just a single attempt per round, with <br>
later rounds being optional (the contestant could just choose to let <br>
their existing time stand).  These, being extended length events, <br>
could be compared to a 5k or 10k run - how many times do the runners <br>
do these in Olympic competition - Once?  Twice?<br>

No!  The organizer has repeatedly said that if you show up with a <br>
cube in your hands, you&#x27;ll get up on stage (implication being that <br>
you&#x27;d compete).  There is no limit - as long as you can solve it!<br>

          <div class="email-content">There was also a cube art category. It got eliminated because I was 
the only one that applied. :-( Obviously, I cannot compete against 
myself, so they put me in promotions or whatever they call that. 
Maybe something similar has happened to he computer stuff category.

          <div class="email-content">That depends on what your disjoint cylce notation for the corners means.  Does it denote the permutation that was done to the corners in the scramble, or the permutation that must be done to fix them?  (they are the inverse of each other).  I memorize the permutation that must be done to correct them because I find this more handy in computations:

So suppose you must do the permuation (16352)(784) on the corners to fix them.  And seeing as that it&#x27;s easiest to do cycles of three corners, you want to break this large permuation up into smaller steps.  As you have conveniently noticed, doing the permuation (163) on the cube that&#x27;s in this state correctly places corners 6 and 3, so now you remove these two numbers from your initial permuation...you now need to do (152)(784).  you can just remove those two numbers (6 and 3) because, as you noted, those corners are now correct and what needed to go to place 5 has now gone from 3 to 1, and now needs to go from 1 to 5....so it&#x27;s correct to just pull out the 3 and 6 from the permutation.  Does that make sense? And does this answer your question?

next I would do (152) and then finally the permutation (784)

So generally, you can see that any cycle can be broken down into a sequence of three cylces, with a possible two cycle at the end (if the cylce is of even length then a 2 cycle needs to be there for parity).  So (123456789) can be writen as (123)(145)(167)(189)  where operations are done left to right  (you do the permuation (123) before you do (145)....order here is quite important).  So in this manner you can break down the entire corner permutation and know what steps you&#x27;re going to do before you close your eyes. 

I find this method quite useful in blindfold cubing but wasn&#x27;t sure anybody else used it.  I just searched now and realized that Stiff hand&#x27;s cube page explains this approach, is that where you picked it up at?  Most people seem to favor Richard Carr&#x27;s method which is a more &#x27;follow the pieces (numbers) in your head&#x27; approach, but I choose this method for multiple reasons. 

Good luck,
jake E.

Sorry, I didn&#x27;t realize that my potential non-entering of the 
championships would cause so much trouble. Since I had been mainly 
going to go for the computer contest and they were silently dropped, 
only to be revealed when the new webpage came up, and since I 
thought the rules (though apparently not yet decided) for 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5 meant the contest would take too long, I decided provisionally 
not to enter until the rules were finalized, but this has been taken 
as a complete withdrawal and - it would seem - the loss of that 
contest. I&#x27;m not sure why one email questioning the rules has tipped 
the balance so much.

Anyway, you seem to be very impressive at blindfold cubing. Have you 
tried a 4x4x4 yet?

It was listed once but when the official site came up a short while 
back it had been removed. Now we learn it was ditched months ago - 
the quote I got was that 

&quot;computer-we havent successfully found a workable program to warrant 
the event at this time....&quot;

although I don&#x27;t see why oinkleburger isn&#x27;t workable. As I recall 
that was going to be used. Anyway, once that was out of the picture, 
the likelihood of my going was cut dramatically as winning that was 
my main reason for going.

In fact, that on the chat several times it was discussed about the 
possibility or not of doing a 100x100x100 cube and later a 50x50x50 
cube indicates (to me, in my naivety) that a workable program had 
been found. Doing more than one or two 5x5x5s blindfolded in a 
weekend seemed too much stress and I simply noted that I wasn&#x27;t 
prepared to spend what the travel agents have quoted me to enter 
impossible challenges.

Whatever, I&#x27;m not really too concerned with this now. I feel sorry 
for Shotaro but I was going to be finished with cubing after August 
24th anyway, so it&#x27;s not a big loss for me.

          <div class="email-content">Macky, I disdn&#x27;t want cube art to be eliminated, either. But this 
event has two important parameters, money and time. Each event costs 
money and if there are very few entries, itr gets eliminated for lack 
of interest. You  can still dip in that pool, but you cannot compete. 
As for time, we have two days to accomplish qite a lot. A day has 
only 24 hours.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone.<br>
<br>
I have a challenge that some of you might like, all centred on the looking <br>
ahead part of speedsolving.  It might be particularly useful for cubists <br>
like me, who are in that 25-40 second bracket and want to get sub-20 <br>
averages.  It is a way of FORCING yourself to look ahead.<br>
<br>
To do this you need a metronome: a device that produces a regular beat which <br>
you can adjust to make faster or slower.  Metronome numbers represent beats <br>
/ minute, so 60 = 1 beat / second, 120 = 2 beats / second, etc.<br>
<br>
If you do not have a metronome, their is an excellent one online at:<br>
www.metronomeonline.com<br>
<br>
OK here is the challenge.<br>

What is the fastest metronome setting at which you can regularaly solve the <br>
cube as per your method, moving the cube STRICTLY -- no exceptions -- at one <br>
move per click?<br>
<br>
NB:<br>
*  Random moves to fill up time are NOT allowed! (so no UU&#x27;UU&#x27; nonsense)<br>
*  Mistakes / false moves are not allowed, so if you do e.g. the wrong F2L <br>
sequence the solve is discounted (you can decide for yourself how strict you <br>
want to be with this)<br>
*  The absolute final step of your solution can be done at normal speed as <br>
there is no looking ahead left<br>
*  One-off good times are great but don&#x27;t count: this is about averages, not <br>
records<br>
<br>
This may be harder then you think, because if you pause for even a fraction <br>
more than one beat, the whole solve does not count.  So if there is ONE spot <br>
where you find yourself slowing down, you will need to adjust the metronome <br>
setting down to accommodate that speed for your whole solve! But then, as <br>
that area improves, you can shift the speed of the metronome up a notch to a <br>
faster speed and try again.<br>
<br>
This is not only good practice for F2L (especially the first slot: must <br>
prepare for it while solving the cross!) but also for OLL and PLL: these are <br>
quite tricky because if the metronome is set to e.g. 88 it means that the <br>
OLL will pass excruciatingly slowly, then you suddenly have about 0.68 <br>
seconds to recognize which algorithm needs doing for the PLL (so again, <br>
forcing you to look ahead towards the end of the OLL).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of acquiring good looking <br>
ahead skills -- far from it!! -- but it is a fun thing to do, and it may <br>
help some people get faster times, too.  But as far as I am aware, this is <br>
the first suggestion made as to how you can subjectively measure your <br>
looking ahead abilities (are you adagio, andante, or presto :-)?).  It is <br>
also a way to track your improvement in this fairly crucial part of <br>
speedsolving (and set goals, if you are that kind of person)<br>
<br>
If anyone gives it a go, I would be interested to know what time you can do, <br>
so either post them or email me directly.  These are my &quot;levels&quot; but I&#x27;m <br>
towards to bottom and they may need adjusting: I started at 48 and can now <br>
do 60 without too much effort.<br>

Hi,

I definitely belong to the &quot;-48: looking ahead beginner: keep at it!!&quot;
category.
Extending a 2x2x2 block to 2x2x3 often requires more than a 1s
inspection (locate 3 cubies and imagine the optimal sequence). If I
split this step, I may get a much higher BPM rate.
BTW, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is my favorite metronome ;-)

Gilles.

<br>
&gt; What is the fastest metronome setting at which you can regularly solve the<br>

Nice idea!<br>
<br>
I tried http://www.metronomeonline.com a few times, and 120 is a very easy beat<br>
for me.<br>
At that beat I feel veeeeeeery slow DURING a stage. Also during F2L it is<br>
extremely slow for me.<br>
But when going from F2L to OLL and also from OLL to PLL, 120 is a normal beat<br>
for me.<br>
For a faster beat than that I sometimes am a little too slow.<br>
<br>
So I could surely beat 180 for the first two layers, but for last layer 120 -<br>
140 is probably normal because of the pauses in between the stages.<br>
But of course I will practice this more and see where it ends.<br>
<br>

If you insert just one of the edges first, or put it into a position<br>
where it is one move away from its correct place, you will probably end<br>
up with a close to optimal (or even optimal) sequence. My reason for<br>
thinking this is that the edge must get into that position anyway before<br>
the other corner-edge pair can join with it. And since it&#x27;s just a lone<br>
edge piece, it will be resistant to other movement - you can&#x27;t break it<br>
up since it&#x27;s single, and if it temporarily moves, it probably won&#x27;t<br>
flip, so it should be easy to restore. For speedcubing I think this is a<br>
good way to spend your time while you&#x27;re looking around for options. I&#x27;d<br>
be interested to hear what other people do here.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure this strategy works if you always pick the same 3 cubies,<br>
though. Especially if both edges are in awkward positions. If you look<br>
at all three options for extending to the 2x2x3, the good edges are easy<br>
to spot. Of course, if I see a corner joined with an edge, that usually<br>
overrides this strategy (even if I see it after I&#x27;ve moved the lone<br>
edge (actually, it is sometimes the moving of the lone edge that<br>
accidentally forms a different corner-edge :-)).<br>

&gt; *  The absolute final step of your solution can be done at normal speed as <br>

<br>
While experimenting with different ways of solving the cube, I developed<br>
a method that used memorised sequences for all but the final step, and<br>
then used intuition at the end! That meant the final step needed some<br>
looking ahead. On the other hand, the rest of it required no thought.<br>
<br>
It was a human version of the Thistlethwaite algorithm. I&#x27;m sure that if<br>
you memorised sequences for all final step positions, you could achieve<br>
an average of 40 moves without any thinking time. How boring! That&#x27;s one<br>
reason why I chucked the idea into the bin. If anyone else is interested<br>
in it, I&#x27;d be glad to pass it on to someone else. Maybe someone can<br>
achieve 13 seconds average with it.<br>
<br>
Now I&#x27;m working on another method that currently uses about 42 moves and<br>
is intuition based. It is more attractive because it requires relatively<br>
few algorithms (about the same as the standard Fridrich system), and it<br>
also gives me the opportunity to think.<br>
<br>
Now for something on topic, I think the metronome idea is great. I<br>
wonder if someone can break a speed record that way?<br>

Often, here&#x27;s what I do:
- find the corner
- while looking for the corner, 1 of the 2 edges is located
- while solving corner + 1st edge, locate 2nd edge
- solve 2nd edge

But, in many situations, it&#x27;s faster to solve the 3 pieces in 1 pass.
Because of the number of moves, or because you can plan shortcuts. I
can&#x27;t tell you exactly when, it&#x27;s mostly intuitive. 1/2 sec wasted
here can be a good decision.

Note: I always take the same colors for this 2x2x3. 17 moves on
average. 7.5 secs.

I realize I may be a little late on my reply (since you already went <br>

<br>
As I understand it, you were planning to only have two categories - <br>
50x50x50 (or even 100x100x100) and 20x20x20.  This would pretty much <br>
keep most people from being able to participate!  I would like to see <br>
the event with categories in the normal cube size range (2x2x2 - <br>
5x5x5), as well as a couple larger cubes (maybe 10x10x10, 15x15x15, <br>
and/or 20x20x20).  I think anything at or above 20x20x20 is going to <br>
exclude too many people from being able to participate, as the <br>
current best time on even just a 20x20x20 is over 2 hours 45 minutes!<br>

I have a challenge that some of you might like, all centred on the looking 
ahead part of speedsolving.  It might be particularly useful for cubists 
like me, who are in that 25-40 second bracket and want to get sub-20 
averages.  It is a way of FORCING yourself to look ahead.

To do this you need a metronome: a device that produces a regular beat which 
you can adjust to make faster or slower.  Metronome numbers represent beats 
/ minute, so 60 = 1 beat / second, 120 = 2 beats / second, etc.

If you do not have a metronome, their is an excellent one online at:
www.metronomeonline.com

OK here is the challenge.

What is the fastest metronome setting at which you can regularaly solve the 
cube as per your method, moving the cube STRICTLY -- no exceptions -- at one 
move per click?

NB:
*  Random moves to fill up time are NOT allowed! (so no UU&#x27;UU&#x27; nonsense)
*  Mistakes / false moves are not allowed, so if you do e.g. the wrong F2L 
sequence the solve is discounted (you can decide for yourself how strict you 
want to be with this)
*  The absolute final step of your solution can be done at normal speed as 
there is no looking ahead left
*  One-off good times are great but don&#x27;t count: this is about averages, not 
records

This may be harder then you think, because if you pause for even a fraction 
more than one beat, the whole solve does not count.  So if there is ONE spot 
where you find yourself slowing down, you will need to adjust the metronome 
setting down to accommodate that speed for your whole solve! But then, as 
that area improves, you can shift the speed of the metronome up a notch to a 
faster speed and try again.

This is not only good practice for F2L (especially the first slot: must 
prepare for it while solving the cross!) but also for OLL and PLL: these are 
quite tricky because if the metronome is set to e.g. 88 it means that the 
OLL will pass excruciatingly slowly, then you suddenly have about 0.68 
seconds to recognize which algorithm needs doing for the PLL (so again, 
forcing you to look ahead towards the end of the OLL).

I&#x27;m not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of acquiring good looking 
ahead skills -- far from it!! -- but it is a fun thing to do, and it may 
help some people get faster times, too.  But as far as I am aware, this is 
the first suggestion made as to how you can subjectively measure your 
looking ahead abilities (are you adagio, andante, or presto :-)?).  It is 
also a way to track your improvement in this fairly crucial part of 
speedsolving (and set goals, if you are that kind of person)

If anyone gives it a go, I would be interested to know what time you can do, 
so either post them or email me directly.  These are my &quot;levels&quot; but I&#x27;m 
towards to bottom and they may need adjusting: I started at 48 and can now 
do 60 without too much effort.

-48:     looking ahead beginner: keep at it!!
48-60:   learning to look ahead
60-96:   getting their ...
96-152:  good to very good
152-176: pro at anticipating next move
176+ :   world champion??

Where do you fit in?  :-)

best,
S.

          <div class="email-content">Sorry I didn&#x27;t get your question correct the first time.  

First, do you understand what the notation means in terms of a permutation?  &#x27;(276)&#x27; means that the corner is place 2 goes to spot 7, the corner in place 7 goes to place 6, and 6 goes back to 2.  With this in mind you move the three pieces so they&#x27;re all in the U face and then decide from there, depending on which direction they need to travel, which algorithm you are going to use.  specifically doing (276), and assuming that we&#x27;re using stiff hands&#x27; corner numbering system, I would do the face move F2 so that 6 and 7 take the place of 4 and 1 respectively.  And then I would do an algorithm that moves the corners counterclockwise and doesn&#x27;t include the RBU corner.  If you have also decided to use stiff hands&#x27; algorithms then you&#x27;d break up (276) into (27)(26) and do each of these tranpositions individually.

Also, with the situation you mentioned, trying to do (26738), you would break this up as (267)(238) and perform each of these three cycles individually as explained above.
   
I hope that helps

          <div class="email-content">What method are you using? And is your cube oiled? That has a lot to 
do with being able to go fast. I actually average about 70-80 moves 
too, but I can do 30 seconds. And if you want to lower your moves a 
lot, then don&#x27;t time yourself for a while. For the next 2 weeks or 
so, just solve it slowly, trying to use as few moves as possible. 
Slowly you will lower your average to at most 70 moves.
And you need to do the last layer in about 2 sequences, three at most.

          <div class="email-content">The method is cross on top, top corners, middle 4 edges, bottom 
corners (position then orient) then bottom edges (position then 
orient).  Yes my cube is lubed.  I can do the last layer in usually 2 
secquences for the corners, and 2 for the edges, which is 4. I 
haven&#x27;t learned enough algorithms yet.  Thanks for the advice.  I&#x27;ll 
keep it at.  One of the guys on here is helping me on AIM now 
teaching the Petrus system.  Not sure if I like it or not yet... 
we&#x27;ll see.

&gt; Often, here&#x27;s what I do:<br>
&gt; - find the corner<br>
&gt; - while looking for the corner, 1 of the 2 edges is located<br>
&gt; - while solving corner + 1st edge, locate 2nd edge<br>
&gt; - solve 2nd edge<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But, in many situations, it&#x27;s faster to solve the 3 pieces in 1 pass.<br>
&gt; Because of the number of moves, or because you can plan shortcuts. I<br>
&gt; can&#x27;t tell you exactly when, it&#x27;s mostly intuitive. 1/2 sec wasted<br>
&gt; here can be a good decision.<br>
<br>
I used to start looking for the corner first, but I just found it too<br>
difficult (have to recognise its three orientations). Maybe if I always<br>
picked the same colours it would be easier to find the corner. Since I<br>
use different colours every time, I find it easier to spot edges first.<br>
<br>
&gt; Note: I always take the same colors for this 2x2x3. 17 moves on<br>
&gt; average. 7.5 secs.<br>
<br>
Here is my move count for steps 1 and 2, placing the lone edge first for<br>
step 2:<br>
<br>
4 + 6  = 10<br>
5 + 7  = 12<br>
7 + 6* = 13<br>
5 + 6  = 11<br>
6 + 6  = 12<br>
Average= 11.6 moves<br>
<br>
(*) here I found a corner-edge already joined<br>
<br>
This wasn&#x27;t going at full speed though, but I did go with the first edge<br>
I found. I&#x27;ve never counted moves for steps 1 and 2 at top speed because<br>
because my step 3 tends to get mixed in sometimes early, sometimes late<br>
(anywhere from step 0 to step 5). When I do steps 1-2-3 as a group, I do<br>
know that it takes 20 moves or less at top speed.<br>
<br>
Also, I haven&#x27;t really taken average times because I haven&#x27;t learnt the<br>
whole of my method. My best ever average was 40 seconds but that was<br>
back in 1998 using a different method.<br>

&gt; Sorry, I didn&#x27;t realize that my potential non-entering of the <br>
&gt; championships would cause so much trouble. Since I had been mainly <br>
&gt; going to go for the computer contest and they were silently <br>
dropped, <br>
&gt; only to be revealed when the new webpage came up, and since I <br>
&gt; thought the rules (though apparently not yet decided) for 4x4x4 and <br>
&gt; 5x5x5 meant the contest would take too long, I decided <br>
provisionally <br>
&gt; not to enter until the rules were finalized, but this has been <br>
taken <br>
&gt; as a complete withdrawal and - it would seem - the loss of that <br>
&gt; contest. I&#x27;m not sure why one email questioning the rules has <br>
tipped <br>
&gt; the balance so much.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway, you seem to be very impressive at blindfold cubing. Have <br>
you <br>
&gt; tried a 4x4x4 yet?<br>
<br>
No, I haven&#x27;t done a 4x4x4 yet, but I started giving some thoughts to <br>
it a couple of days ago. I actually registered for it in WC2003, so I <br>
guess I will have to master it pretty soon...<br>
I am really learning a lot from your site on 4x4x4. Since I prefer <br>
using cycle notation (less planning required, I think?), my biggest <br>
wall will be in the centers. I&#x27;m thinking of numbering the faces A-F <br>
and <br>
showing the permutation in a cycle with... it&#x27;s still not solid, but <br>
I hope to be able to establish a method that fits me soon.<br>
But are you serious about dropping WC &amp; giving the cube up all <br>
together? I am really shocked... You&#x27;ve given me great imspirations <br>
with all those great achievements...<br>
<br>
Sorry I never replied to some of your mails... My computer&#x27;s network <br>
has been down for a long time now. (this isn&#x27;t my computer I&#x27;m using <br>
right now) <br>

I totally agree with that. Especially if Ron&#x27;s site is publicly 
advertized, I bet a whole new group of cubers, from speed to computer 
and blindfold, will come into the world of Cube.

          <div class="email-content">There are two main schools of thought as far as cube methods are concerned, Petrus method, and Fridrich method.
The algorithms on my site www.cubestation.co.uk are designed to be used with the Fridrich First Two Layer system, which means that to complete the first two layers, rather than making the cross, solving the corners and then solving the edges, which takes moves and time, you proceed by solving both the Corner AND its adjacent middle layer Edge simultaneously. This obviously cuts down the number of moves required, but also requires the memorisation of at least 41 algorithms, if you want to experience the full benefits of the system for the first two layers.

For the last layer, the majority of expert cubers use a standard 2-look last layer, which is seperated from the first two layers (F2L). The Last Layer is broken down into two distinct stages, Orient, then Permute. The reason that this method has become so popular is because of the ease of recognition of all the cases, which allows you to be able to become very fast once you have mastered it. In total however, and this is what may put some people off, there are no less than 57 Orientation algorithms, and 21 Permutation algorithms, but trust me, once you have had some practice and experience with the cube, gained some understanding about it, and you have these under your belt, it will seem like a piece of cake!

Also, it would be a good idea, if you were to have a look at the Fridrich method, is to get into the habit of solving the cross on the bottom, or on the left, NOW. It is very difficult to get out of a habit once you have learned so much that depends on the cross on top!

Any other help you want, or if you want to chat about the system and discuss ideas, please feel free to email me @ dan_j_harris@... or my Yahoo! ID is hatadey.

  The method is cross on top, top corners, middle 4 edges, bottom 
  corners (position then orient) then bottom edges (position then 
  orient).  Yes my cube is lubed.  I can do the last layer in usually 2 
  secquences for the corners, and 2 for the edges, which is 4. I 
  haven&#x27;t learned enough algorithms yet.  Thanks for the advice.  I&#x27;ll 
  keep it at.  One of the guys on here is helping me on AIM now 
  teaching the Petrus system.  Not sure if I like it or not yet... 
  we&#x27;ll see.

          <div class="email-content">yes, of course it makes it easier to find the pieces. With the cross on bottom, you have a very good view of FR, FL, and the whole top layer, allowing you to look ahead for your first F2L pairing while you are making the cross :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you mean can you scramble it after you solve it, yes.  I must admit though, it&#x27;s tougher to scramble (especially to have other people scramble it for you) than the rubiks cube.  This is mostly because it has to be lined up just right before it will turn.  But it is a fun puzzle, and a bit challenging too.<br>

I would reccomend against mefferts.  I have one that stays together, but is<br>
rather stiff, and one that doesn&#x27;t stay together.  Apart from that, if you<br>
DO find a good brand, let us know :)<br>

<br>
  Hey I know this has probably already been asked, but what is a good <br>
  5x5x5 brand to get for a speedcube?  I have one of the ones form <br>
  puzzletts.com when it was still selling them and it is great, only I <br>
  have abused it for several years so it is about time to get a new <br>
  one.  Just curious what brands people use and are happy/not happy <br>
  with.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; what is a good 5x5x5 brand to get for a speedcube? <br>
Hi Chris. <br>
<br>
A few people directly asked me about 4x4 and 5x5 which I am using. <br>
So I think this is good timing to post here. <br>
<br>
4x4: I use rubiks.com&#x27;s in my videos. But it is stiff when you opened <br>
the package and it takes long time to make it smooth. (I have never <br>
sanded it.) A few months ago I got Eastsheen&#x27;s 4x4. It turns well and <br>
siliconization makes big difference. It changes in a day! <br>
Actually, I set 94 sec in average with Eastsheen before I get current <br>
record. Personally, I prefer rubiks.com&#x27;s 4x4. <br>
Eastsheen&#x27;s is too small for me, but it is also good alternative. <br>
<br>
5x5: I also use rubiks.com&#x27;s 5x5 in my video (mechanically same). <br>
I also got Eastsheen&#x27;s 5x5. In regard to turn, it also turns well. <br>
But it often explodes!! Not just POP. When it happens, half of the <br>
parts spread to everywhere. I also had Meffert&#x27;s tiled 5x5. I really <br>
don&#x27;t like tiles. I removed all tiles and put new stickers instead. <br>
This is mechanically same as rubiks.com&#x27;s 5x5. I unscrewed a little <br>
bit. It becomes better, but still not as good as my old one. <br>
I hope this becomes good speedcube. <br>
<br>

I think a bandelow 5x5x5 is good. You can get one off Ebay from a <br>
seller named &quot;5x5x5&quot; (go figure). It is White opp Blue.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would have to agree, the bandelow cubes are nice.  Mefferts and 
rubiks are pretty much the same, i personally like the tiles from 
mefferts but the mefferts cube explodes a lot on me.  
I think the eastsheen 5x5 is really good for people use to looser 
cubes, i&#x27;ve never had a pop when i use my eastsheen but my friends 
always pop it, so it just might be a question of force there.  THe 
big problem with the eastsheen is that i get my fingers tangled up in 
it cause it is way to small, if they could make one with bigger 
cubies that would be awesome!!!

Living in Canberra, Australia, it wasn&#x27;t realistic for me to make it <br>
to Toronto. However, by sheer coincidence, I&#x27;m actually going to be <br>
travelling to Washington DC in August. I&#x27;m thinking that if I&#x27;m <br>
making the huge trip from Canberra to DC, then I&#x27;ve really got no <br>
excuse not to make the (much shorter) trip from DC to Toronto!<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t registered yet as I&#x27;ve not been able to view <br>
the &#x27;Competition Rules&#x27; link from the Registration page (I can see <br>
the rest of the site though). DanG, if you&#x27;re reading this, I&#x27;ll keep <br>
trying the site and if I can&#x27;t get the page I&#x27;ll send an email <br>
inquiry to the website (I assume this is what you&#x27;d prefer us to do).<br>
<br>
My times are still really bad compared to many of you so I&#x27;m not <br>
expecting to get very far, but I reckon it will be awesome to just be <br>
involved!! :)<br>
<br>
BTW, I&#x27;ve been really busy lately and I&#x27;ve got heaps of messages to <br>
catch up on. The main thing that&#x27;s been keeping me busy is that I&#x27;ve <br>
moved house. I&#x27;m yet to get my computer set up again and my internet <br>
connection sorted which means it may take a while for me to catch up <br>
on the posts. I generally prefer not to do personal &#x27;net stuff at <br>

I work at Oxford UK, so it is not quite so far for me, but by a bizarre <br>

Are any other Australians thinking of going, so you know?<br>

Mefferts sells two types of 5x5x5 cubes - ones similar to Rubik&#x27;s <br>
professor cube and smaller ones.  These smaller ones (by EastSheen) <br>
haven&#x27;t given me any problems with falling apart, and are anything <br>
but stiff.  Without lubing them, they are decent, and after a lube, <br>
some would actually argue that they move too freely.<br>

I have no chance of winning anything either, but I&#x27;m not concerned by 
this. My reasons for wanting to go are to meet other speedcubers (and 
one cube artist!), to know that I&#x27;d given it a go, and to have fun! :)

to Toronto, I thought it should get some practice speedcubing in <br>
front of people.<br>
<br>
I generally don&#x27;t get too nervous cubing in front of people unless I <br>
know that there are other speedcubers around. Even if I do a really <br>
bad time, to someone who can&#x27;t even solve a cube, it&#x27;s still very <br>
impressive. Anyway, at the party my times were *all over the place*!! <br>
People were timing me at  various points and my times ranged from 42 <br>
seconds to around 80 seconds. I did an average of 10 last night and <br>
got times from 50-90 seconds, with an average of around 68 seconds. <br>
I&#x27;m thinking that I really need to consolidate.<br>
<br>
In any cubing session, even if brief (say 10 solves) then I can <br>
usually get a few times under 60 seconds, but I also get a few <br>
shockers. The fact that I can get under 60 seconds on a semi-regular <br>
basis makes me think that if I just work on what I know (ie. not <br>
learn any more algs for now) I should be able to always get under 60 <br>
seconds. I know what my problem is, it&#x27;s that I lose time moving from <br>
the cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when moving from the F2L <br>
to the LL. If I manage to do it all smoothly, then I always get under <br>
60 seconds.<br>
<br>
I guess I&#x27;m not really asking for advice since I know what the <br>
problem is. I also know that the only answer is just to practice <br>
practice practice!! Just felt like sharing...<br>

I remember going through the same stage, and my times were almost<br>
identical to yours (ranging from 50 to 90 seconds).<br>
<br>
&gt; I know what my problem is, it&#x27;s that I lose time moving from <br>
&gt; the cross to the rest of the F2L, and then when moving from the F2L <br>

&gt; 60 seconds.<br>
<br>
It might be effective to spend some time working out and memorising ways<br>
to solve each different case that can come up at each step. This does<br>
not involve learning any new algorithms, but simply memorising how and<br>
when to apply them.<br>
<br>
For example, if you only know one algorithm for twisting 3 corners on<br>
the last layer at a time, think about all the possible ways the corners<br>
can be twisted on the last layer (there are only 7 ways, and one of them<br>
is the solved state), and work out beforehand the sequence of algorithms<br>
you would apply to solve each case. Then practice each case so that next<br>
time you see it during a real solve, you will be able to solve it<br>
automatically. This should reduce or even elimate your delays.<br>
<br>
Another reason for delaying might be when you move on to the next step,<br>
and you don&#x27;t remember what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing. Here, you just<br>
need to insert a trigger into your memory that will fire as you are<br>
approaching the end of each step. With some focus, you can practice<br>
activating that trigger until it becomes routine and automatic. For<br>
example, as you&#x27;re approaching the end of the cross, you should be<br>
remembering to look for a white corner piece on the opposite side of the<br>
cube (if white&#x27;s your cross colour).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I believe you named all the top solutions to the problem. I 
personally have been using vinly tape for the past few years and 
love the brightness of the cube with them. I purchese an assortmant 
pack of 5 colors (all but orange) made by 3M, it&#x27;s easy to find it 
at Target or Meijers. They last fairly long even with the abuse I 
give them, performing over 200 solves a day, 3 times a week. For 
orange I looked in several hardware shops. My orange ones run about 
a month after sticking them on. For the incredible look, I don&#x27;t 
mind having to replace stickers every month or so.

I would highly recommend against buying the rubikshop sets, since 
they are over priced and last for only 1-2 weeks. Paint wouldn&#x27;t be 
a bad idea, I havn&#x27;t tried it but with the right paint, would 
imagine that it would take a lot of time and care to get it looking 
right. Multiple coats of course, with drying time in between. I 
believe Vining uses this approach. Using the plastic off notebooks 
or dividers would probably be my second choice, definatly choose 
bright and thick ones though. Gilles site 
(http://grrroux.free.fr/me/me.html)
details this method, and using neoprene glue means that you can 
still take the stickers off easily with a razor blade in the future. 
This may be the best permanent, but not too permenent solution.

You say you runined that cube, but perhaps with a good razorblade 
you can that those off. I just got a Studio cube recently also, I&#x27;ll 
be changing the stickers on it soon, before they get destroyed. Some 
of my screws are turning WITH the faces however, and I may need help 
with this problem.

Robert is right, there were two more casualties 3 or maybe 4 days 
ago. I hope you didn&#x27;t expect the organizers to say &quot;SARS is not 
under control, it still kills some people, even in Toronto.&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">yes the screws turned with the faces on my studio cube too.  i used 
super glue on the screw threads to fix it.  this is what i did to 
prepare my studio cube:

1.  new cube, very stiff, totally unusable
2.  disassemble cube and pop all six middle faces off with razor 
blade
3.  assemble cube and tighten all the screws down all the way to 
make it extremely tight
4.  turn the cube for an hour
5.  disassemble cube and wash all the plastic bits out with water 
and assemble entire cube
6.  unscrew one center and remove the center face so you have a 
complete cube except the hole in one center
7.  put a drop of super glue in the screw threads
8.  reinstall the center:  tighten the screw all the way, then back 
it out 1.5 turns (or however loose/tight you like it)
9. repeat steps 6 - 8 for the other five sides
10. pop an edge and lubricate cube with castle 100% silicone spray

the cube now turns like butter and the corners don&#x27;t rattle and it 
rarely pops pieces.  now if i could just figure out what to do about 
the stickers!  i will probably try buying the vinyl tape.

He states that &quot;My record time in the World Competition in Hungary was 22
seconds. It will be very difficult, if not physically impossible, to beat
this time.&quot;

I think it&#x27;s a load of crap and that the record will be broken, and with a
large margin .. but mostly because of the fact that this time the
competitors  will be able to bring their own cubes.

I dont want to discredit the competitors of the 82 WC because i know that
they were very fast, and if they had used their own cubes i think the
records would be much lower.

Any comments on this ? Are the best cubers now faster than the best cubers
were in 82 ?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

   The basic basic problems with most cubes:
   1. Stickers wear out easily,
   2. The center caps are hard to get off,
   3. The center cubies unscrew or tighten up,
   4. The cubes pop pieces alot,
   5. Lack of contrast between blue and green that they sometimes get
mixed up.
   6. The plastic is weak and thin and not very slick.

   All four of these problems were addressed by Ideal in 1980. The
solutions were:
   1. Stickers were replaced by plastic tiles,
   2. There are no caps; the screws are underneath the tiles which are
easy to pry off and easily reglued.
   3. There is a small washer on the head of the screw,
   4. They went back to the original design which is having a center
cubie which is ached underneath. When you open your cube and remove
one layer you should see a circle. If it&#x27;s flat under the center cubie
it&#x27;s not a circle so the edge pieces can derail and pop out easily,
   5. Green was made much brighter,
   6. The plastic was 3 or 4 times as thick, and slicker. In 1981 was
often beating 25 seconds with no lubrication.

   The solution was applied to the Deluxe cube in 1980, and in the
Rubik&#x27;s Game cube, from 1982, which is a Deluxe with little peg holes
in the center of the tiles.
   These are excellent cubes. They come up fairly regularly on ebay.
There is a &quot;deluxe&quot; that is made now but I don&#x27;t know if it is at all
like the original.

I would say the opposite. The methods are better now, but the technology isn&#x27;t.<br>
<br>
We had silicon spray back in those days, and the cubes were probably <br>
slightly better, if anything.<br>
<br>
The advantage the cuber today has over the old timers is the <br>
Internet. I had to discover pretty much every algorithm myself. <br>
Others were more in contact with other cubers, but even so someone <br>
had to discover everything by hand, and tell others about it either <br>
in person or possibly by mail.<br>
<br>
Today you can find all the algorithms you could possibly need online. <br>
And they&#x27;re known to be perfect. The game today is mostly to learn to <br>
do a method real fast, not to develop a good method as it was much <br>
more back then.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah.. thats a good point.  On stage anything can happen.  someone 
like me may have a freaky 11.3 second time hehehe.  But breaking 22 
sec is possible, its gonna be super tough but possible!  If i knew 
that i was averaging 16-17 sec solves, i&#x27;d consider myself as totally 
owning the competition, but once you factor that you KNOW that you 
can achieve these times, means that you may PUSH yourself to achieve 
those times, and end up totally screwing up an alg, popping, or 
dropping the cube, or get a 23 sec time and barely beat the record.  
BUT i don&#x27;t average 16-17 sec per solve, so i have nothing to worry 
about :)

          <div class="email-content">Yep, totally agree! I aim to have lots of fun!

My fiance is keen to come and watch. He owns a cube (I gave it to 
him) but hasn&#x27;t managed to solve it yet. He&#x27;s not into cubing like I 
am, but he&#x27;s certainly impressed by what I&#x27;ve told him about everyone 
here. He thinks I&#x27;m fast when I solve it in a minute, so he&#x27;ll be 
totally astounded by seeing people do it in 20 seconds. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone. So now my dream has finally come true =)Today I broke <br>
the world record on the 3x3x3 cube with an avg of 16.5 seconds. I <br>
have been on vacation for two weeks and I didn&#x27;t really cube much <br>
during. And when I got back home I lubed my cube (terrible before) <br>
and then I suddenly made very fast times! <br>
<br>
My style of solving the cube is a little bit of risktaking I <br>
suppose. I don&#x27;t solve the cube as smooth as many other people, and <br>
I solve it &quot;faster&quot; when it comes to &quot;going slowly&quot;. What I mean is <br>
that I don&#x27;t really try to go slowly, just really concentrate on <br>
finding the next pair and still do all the F2L algs quite fast. <br>
Sometimes I can get an avg of up to 18 seconds. This happens when I <br>
am either tired or unfocused (which leads to bad looking ahead in <br>
the F2L and pauses between algs). But on the other hand when I am <br>
really concentrated I make very fast times since I have no pauses <br>
but still many face moves per second. <br>
<br>
Here were my times:<br>
(13) 15 17 14 18 18 15 17 15 16 (19) 15 =&gt; 16.0 + 0.5<br>
No bad times, and that&#x27;s more important than to make a few fast ones.<br>
<br>
I will try to make another (and much better) video of me solving the <br>
cube maybe in two weeks. My old one is dowmnloadable at: <br>
http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip<br>
It&#x27;s not a very good quality nor solve, but it&#x27;s the only one I got. <br>
As you can see I had bad recognition in the F2L, but anyway it was a <br>
descent time in front of people.<br>
I have no Rubik&#x27;s cube home site if anyone wonders. <br>
<br>
At last: What is a reasonable limit for speedcubing? I would say <br>
that it&#x27;s not impossible to brake 16 seconds in the future (although <br>
it would require a LOT of training and most of all learning more <br>
algs. I challenge you other guys to keep on practising until we <br>
reach the dream limit 16 seconds (for me it is). And enjoy the <br>
speedcubing! It&#x27;s a lot of fun =)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey David you&#x27;re awesome, congratulations. 

You&#x27;ve improved very fast from 18.5 seconds to &lt;17, and finally you 
have broken the unofficially WorldRecord.

I don&#x27;t care about your video, or you &quot;style of solving&quot;, every good 
speedcubist (sub20) has is own style, and his own algs. I only look 
at the times, and they are really good. Congrats again!

but! be careful at Ron&#x27;s revenge ;-))

Ok so it only works in internet explorer, and it is very slow. Maybe <br>
some java guy could make this in java, or tell me how to use the java <br>
applets to get the same effect.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, as I was writing my previous post I was thinking that some 
people probably do have old cubes that are so loose that they could 
put in a corner piece last. However, I just assumed that anyone 
initially attempted to restore a cube this way is probably new to 
cubing and therefore likely to have a fairly stiff cube.  :)

&gt; Subject: [Speed cubing group] Broke the world record<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi everyone. So now my dream has finally come true =)Today I broke<br>
&gt; the world record on the 3x3x3 cube with an avg of 16.5 seconds. I<br>
&gt; have been on vacation for two weeks and I didn&#x27;t really cube much<br>
&gt; during. And when I got back home I lubed my cube (terrible before)<br>
&gt; and then I suddenly made very fast times!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My style of solving the cube is a little bit of risktaking I<br>
&gt; suppose. I don&#x27;t solve the cube as smooth as many other people, and<br>
&gt; I solve it &quot;faster&quot; when it comes to &quot;going slowly&quot;. What I mean is<br>
&gt; that I don&#x27;t really try to go slowly, just really concentrate on<br>
&gt; finding the next pair and still do all the F2L algs quite fast.<br>
&gt; Sometimes I can get an avg of up to 18 seconds. This happens when I<br>
&gt; am either tired or unfocused (which leads to bad looking ahead in<br>
&gt; the F2L and pauses between algs). But on the other hand when I am<br>
&gt; really concentrated I make very fast times since I have no pauses<br>
&gt; but still many face moves per second.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here were my times:<br>
&gt; (13) 15 17 14 18 18 15 17 15 16 (19) 15 =&gt; 16.0 + 0.5<br>
&gt; No bad times, and that&#x27;s more important than to make a few fast ones.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I will try to make another (and much better) video of me solving the<br>
&gt; cube maybe in two weeks. My old one is dowmnloadable at:<br>
&gt; http://web.holmstroms.com/skogshyddan/david_kuben.zip<br>
&gt; It&#x27;s not a very good quality nor solve, but it&#x27;s the only one I got.<br>
&gt; As you can see I had bad recognition in the F2L, but anyway it was a<br>
&gt; descent time in front of people.<br>
&gt; I have no Rubik&#x27;s cube home site if anyone wonders.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; At last: What is a reasonable limit for speedcubing? I would say<br>
&gt; that it&#x27;s not impossible to brake 16 seconds in the future (although<br>
&gt; it would require a LOT of training and most of all learning more<br>
&gt; algs. I challenge you other guys to keep on practising until we<br>
&gt; reach the dream limit 16 seconds (for me it is). And enjoy the<br>
&gt; speedcubing! It&#x27;s a lot of fun =)<br>

I forgot talking about the limit of speedcubing.
With JESSICA&#x27;s method, I would say the limit is around 15, not much 
less, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s sub 16.

But if someone found a new method, averaging let&#x27;s say 40 moves (why 
not???), it might be possible to get some 13 seconds averages (at 
about 3 moves per second). 

So we can&#x27;t guess the limit of speedcubing, but we can imagine it 
must be 15-16 (maybe sub15 terje?), with the current methods.

I think many would agree with me when I say that you need to get an <br>
EastSheen 2x2x2 from Meffert&#x27;s.  They are $9 with free shipping.  You <br>

  someone must IM me because i dont have VM for chat.  i copied the 
  algotithms for the fridrich method.  i solve the cube with the cross 
  on the left side.  do i need to change these algoritms so they can 
  be useful.  because now, when i try to solve for a corner and an 
  edge, i find no algorithm that lets me solve that cubie.

Andy can solve the cube under 20 sec CONSISTENTLY, that&#x27;s got mean 
his average is probably sub-19...
Now that&#x27;s really impressivce, but I don&#x27;t see his record on 
speedcubing.com. I mean, he can probably be in the top 10, so why 
wouldn&#x27;t he post? Doesn&#x27;t he know about it?
I&#x27;m just really curious since I&#x27;m 13 and just got 19.9 avg w/ some 
luck. I hope to beat my record soon.

          <div class="email-content">I make the cross on the bottom and keep it on the left when solving 
the 4 edge-corner pairs. Then I solve the LL on top. It&#x27;s something I 
developped over time and it works pretty well for me. Sometimes I also 
do the first F2L-pair with the cross on the bottom if I know the 
moves.

          <div class="email-content">Speedcubing is, shall we say, the oldest discipline in the Rubik&#x27;s 
cube kingdom, but there are others, that yet need to  be developed. I 
knew, that when they featured Andy, people will comment. The younger 
set, those whose age is less than or equal to 14 years, will 
complain: &quot;Now wny am I not featured? I am at least as good, if not 
better, than Andy.&quot; (Please  note the quotation marks. )

The championships in Toronto will resolve all those questions. Also, 
to resolve any doubts as to whether Minh Thai has been derhroned as 
world champion, he should come to Toronto to defend his title under 
the new rules. He says he is not going to. Well, that is his decision.

<br>
Well, to me I believe the right brain takes over. Just like when one drives a car. If the left-brain was in control of &quot;speed cubing,&quot; it would not be very fast. The left brain is way too slow. The right brain will see the situation and quickly react. <br>
I would assume that when we start with cubing, we first use the left brain (or even for fewest moves). Once we get better, the right brain figures out how to do it faster.<br>

If the LL were on the bottom, you would have to turn the cube to get a look at the whole thing and you cannot plan ahead for the next step of the LL very easily.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am interested to know the average length of some of the algorithms listed<br>
on speedcubing.com. I will use this to compare different strategies.<br>
<br>
Particularly, I&#x27;d like to know about:<br>
<br>
1. the algorithms that place the last F2L pair simultaneously with<br>
   orienting the LL edges (also, how many cases are there?)<br>
2. the algorithms that orient and place the LL corners without affecting<br>
   the orientation of the LL edges.<br>
<br>
Ron, do you know these figures? It would be preferable to know the<br>
average length weighted by probability since that is more accurate, but<br>
otherwise I would still be interested to know the average algorithm<br>
length.<br>
<br>
Also for (1), between 0.5 to 0.75 of the time an alignment move needs to be<br>
inserted before doing the algorithm. I don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s excluded since<br>
I can add 0.75 onto the overall figure for a good estimate.<br>

<br>
Ok, I found the answer to this on the Helmstetter index. It is 9.78. But<br>
I still don&#x27;t know about (1).<br>
<br>
So, considering two methods for the LL where edges are already oriented:<br>
<br>
method 1:<br>
<br>
orient/permute corners = 9.78 moves<br>
permute edges = 8.75 moves<br>
align = 0.75 moves<br>
TOTAL = 19.28<br>
<br>
method 2 (Petrich):<br>
<br>
orient corners = 6.29 moves<br>
permute edges/corners = 11.21 moves<br>
align = 0.75 moves<br>
TOTAL = 18.25<br>
<br>
So, the Petrich method uses fewer moves and fewer algorithms.<br>

Hi Jake,

   &quot;Popular&quot; articles like that often get things wrong.

   You&#x27;re right about memory and skill. Unfortunately people often
confuse having a good memory with being intelligent, ala &quot;Win Ben
Stein&#x27;s Money.&quot; There are lots of folks who have great memories who
don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;ve memorised.

   As to whether one need to be smart to solve a cube, you need to
make a distinction between the different ways of &quot;solving&quot; the cube,
i.e. figuring it out yourself or following someone else&#x27;s directions.
 Figuring it out yourself does take a modicum of brain cells. 

   This is not to say that starting from  memorized facts someone
cannot grasp the material, but this is why I encourage people to
figure it out themselves, at least initially.

   You&#x27;re also right about the both the left and right brain being
involved with solving the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Over the past few years, I have been exploring new ways of solving the
cube. I pretty much stopped speed cubing during this period, and just
continued experimenting until I found a system I was willing to commit
to. This is not it, but Ron suggested that I describe it to you all
anyway. I have a habit of only revealing the systems that I have no
intention of using (for instance, &quot;tripod&quot;). After all, I don&#x27;t want to
give my competitors the advantage :-)

As I said, this system requires no thinking. All solutions to all cases
can be memorised and applied, with an end result of maybe 13 seconds
average. Maybe someone is interested in doing that. Personally, I find
it hard to call that puzzle solving - it&#x27;s more like running the 100
metres.

(btw, I am not competing in this year&#x27;s championships so people have
suggested that I reveal the system I actually use- I agree. Stay tuned.)

Phase 1 -> &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2> group

	- simple, no algorithms

Phase 2 -> &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2> group

	- Direct up/down edges to up/down face (simple, no algs)
	- Direct corners to up/down face (between 8 and 60 algs)

Phase 3 -> &lt;U2,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2> group

	- Corners (between 1 and 2 algs)
	- Edges (between 1 and 4 algs)

Phase 4 -> place pieces

	- Corners (intuitive)
	- Edges (intuitive)

DETAILS OF STEPS

* PHASE 1

This is solved in 4.6 moves on average.

* PHASE 2 EDGES

This is rather simple. You can learn all 20-30 cases if you wish. I
forget the exact number. This can be solved in an average of 4 moves.

* PHASE 2 CORNERS

I used a method similar to Gaetan - first get 3 corners oriented on one
side, and then apply one of 8 algorithms. It is possible to directly
learn all 60 cases if you want (I can&#x27;t remember the exact number).
I think they have an average of 8.5 moves.

* PHASE 3 CORNERS

In phase 3, it is important to do the corners first, because it is
difficult to see whether they have made it into the U2D2L2R2F2B2 group.
Just getting opposite colours on each side isn&#x27;t enough. The algorithms
you learn to fix this are shorter when you don&#x27;t have to worry about the
edges.

Here, I&#x27;ll just describe the simplest technique that requires two
algorithms, but is very quick for the fingers and brain:

First, separate up/down colours (one colour on each side). Average 3.2
moves. There should be, for example, all red corners on top, and all
orange corners on bottom.

Now, pairs of adjacent corners will either match or mismatch. Our goal
is to make them either all match, or all mismatch. So, in this step, we
find the odd pairs out (whether they&#x27;re matching or mismatching), and
fix them so they match/mismatch like all the rest. There are 4 pairs.
Either one pair is the odd one out, or two pairs are the odd ones out.

For one pair: hold the pair at UF, and do R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R. It&#x27;s a
modification of the corner mover that doesn&#x27;t care about the exact
positions of corners.

Two pairs: hold two pairs on F (you may need to move them there), and do
R2UF2U2R2U. (if you needed to move them there first, there&#x27;s also a
trick to get it to work...)

I looked for a long time to find other methods here that used fewer
moves. I found some, but this way was definitely by far the quickest to
perform.

PHASE 3 EDGES

4 cases - simple (2,4,6 or 8 bad edges). Average 6.1 moves.

Total moves so far: 33.4. Obviously, fewer moves are necessary to
achieve an average of 40 moves overall. I worked out some shortcuts, but
I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth it, because I could perform the longer way
faster.

PHASE 4 (the end game)

I think you already have a strategy for this. Corners, then edges. I
think it&#x27;s possible to learn all cases for the edges (about 150 I think,
but easy to memorise). 

A downside is the number of double turns which are more difficult to
perform. But I tried a few algorithms and they are possible to do
quickly enough. I think the main benefit of this method is fast reaction
time and no thinking. Another benefit is that it looks cool when you
solve it. None of the pieces are placed until the very end.

Above, I listed each individual step with no shortcuts. It is possible
to combine steps, or do steps in different orders depending on
opportunities. The basic method above, if you learnt all cases for each
exact step, should give an average of 45.7 moves.

----- End forwarded message -----

Just a note I&#x27;d like to add: it is not necessary to stick to only moves
within each group. For example, in phase 4, it is not necessary to stick
to double turns. In fact, the shortest solutions for most cases involve
single turns. The first half (phases 1-2) already has a lot of freedom
of movement. I suppose it could be solved in 5 to 6 seconds. Maybe
someone has a better way to finish phases 3-4? For example, one idea is
to first get all red on top, and all orange on bottom, then permute.
Another idea is to build up blocks like Fridrich and Petrus (more
intuitive).

          <div class="email-content">This is another idea I had a while ago. It similar to the Petrus idea of<br>
orienting edges early so that you only need to turn two sides.<br>
<br>
Instead, we orient all edges right at the beginning, create a &quot;line&quot; on<br>
the D side from front to back (or a cross if you wish), then we only<br>
need to turn three sides to solve the rest of the cube (L, U, R). This<br>
also means you don&#x27;t ever need to rotate the cube.<br>
<br>
To see what I mean, have a look at this video by AdaM:<br>
<br>
	http://borntodie.free.fr/videos/solvedin16.avi<br>
<br>
Either by plan or by chance, all of your F2L edges must have been<br>
oriented after your first few opening moves. We can deduce this because<br>
after that you only used L,U,R turns to solve the rest of the F2L. On<br>
the other hand, not all of your LL edges were oriented. I have to say<br>
seeing you solve the cube without rotating it looks pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Note, it only takes 4.6 moves on average to orient all edges at the<br>
beginning, and maybe you can combine this with placing parts of the<br>
&quot;line&quot; or &quot;cross&quot;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here is a description of my system.<br>
<br>
The basic idea is, rather than to leave the last layer until last, to<br>
work on the last layer while doing the first two layers (F2L). This<br>
makes it possible to &quot;understand&quot; what you&#x27;re doing to the cube right up<br>
until close to the very end. Only the last 4 pieces require the<br>
assistance of mysterious algorithms. The design of the stages requires<br>
very few algorithms yet gives very short solutions.<br>
<br>
I will explain by modifying the Petrus method (since I first realised<br>
how to make this work last year with the Petrus method). Step 4 involves<br>
completing a 2x3 slice of the F2L, usually built in two parts: a 2x2<br>
square (a corner and two edges) and a 2x1 rectangle (a corner and edge).<br>
<br>
The second section takes (corner/edge) about 7 moves to build. But if<br>
you only insert the edge, it only takes 2 moves average (when you blend<br>
this into the building of the previous section).<br>
<br>
This is a relatively cheap move, but puts the cube into a position that<br>
has 1/8th the number of permutations reduced by symmetries (1/4 because<br>
the U side can be turned independently of the edge, and 1/2 because the<br>
edge is correctly placed and the orientations of the edges are<br>
considered valid from twice as many angles).<br>
<br>
So now what can we do with that?<br>
<br>
Because the edges are already oriented, and because edges are generally<br>
more mobile than corners, it becomes extremely easy to recognise and<br>
manipulate the positions of the edges. We re-shuffle the LL edges while<br>
inserting the last F2L corner, as it is very easy to manipulate the<br>
edges in different ways as the corner is going in. There are in fact<br>
only 17 unique permutations of these 5 pieces (one is the solved state,<br>
so really 16), and they can be solved in an average of 8.5 moves. This<br>
average includes the alignment moves.<br>
<br>
After that, there are only 4 pieces left on the cube unsolved, and they<br>
take 12.5 moves on average to solve, including alignment moves (40 or 50<br>
algorithms depending on whether you count inverses as unique).<br>
<br>
When compared with the original, inserting the last corner/edge pair of<br>
the F2L takes 3.5 moves longer, but it also solves half of the last<br>
layer in the process!<br>
<br>
So, the idea originated with the Petrus method, but what I actually use<br>
now is quite a bit different, especially in the opening steps. However,<br>
everything is the same from inserting the corner simultaneously with the<br>
last layer edges, to the end.<br>
<br>
Here are the other aspects of my system:<br>
<br>
- I start with a 2x2x2 block, but from there, I start building whatever<br>
  I see. One path is to extend to a 2x2x3, but I have practiced several<br>
  other alternative paths and pick whichever way jumps out at me. Here I<br>
  avoid searching for pieces.<br>
- If nothing jumps out at me for each step, I have a fallback strategy<br>
  so that I don&#x27;t have to waste time searching. It works like this:<br>
  basically I have learnt to orient edges at any stage throughout my<br>
  solution. When I can&#x27;t find anything to do at any particular stage, I<br>
  just orient the edges, and then re-examine the situation. This<br>
  orientation is definitely not wasted moves, and wherever I do it, it<br>
  always gives around the same solution length.<br>
- I also learnt how to orient edges while doing the normal routine of<br>
  building blocks. This means I can orient an edge here, and another one<br>
  there, along the way (if it&#x27;s worth it).<br>
<br>
My &quot;normal&quot; sequence is as follows:<br>
<br>

Hi Ross,

   I asked Seven Towns, who own the right&#x27;s to Rubik&#x27;s stuff, and
Winning Moves, who make that particular cube. The cube is a regular
3x3x3. Amazon attached the &quot;deluxe&quot; label.

   Very nice.

   What if the last F2L corner falls into place while inserting the
last F2L edge? Do you take the corner out and put it back or do you
jus place the egdes as step 5?

   The algorithm I use is longer but for me much easier.

   I place tha last level on the right face and perform D&#x27; F2 (R U2 R&#x27;
U&#x27; R U2 ) (L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L) F2 D.

   If you perform (R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 ) (L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L) on the last level
alone it does half the job!

You don&#x27;t like the obvious ((L&#x27;UR&#x27;)U2(LU&#x27;R))2 ?

At first, I had problems with this one. Now I can do it in 2.5s or 3s
(max).

But most of all, the macro L&#x27;UR&#x27;U2LU&#x27;R (or RU&#x27;LU2R&#x27;UL&#x27;) is very useful
for the &quot;G&quot; and &quot;J&quot; permutations (P14-P15-P16-P17-P8-P9) too. You can
use it for &quot;U&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;T&quot; and others, but it&#x27;s less interesting.
Just do it 1000 times before going to bed tonight :-)

Good luck with watercubing,

Gilles.

&gt;    What if the last F2L corner falls into place while inserting the<br>
&gt; last F2L edge? Do you take the corner out and put it back<br>
<br>
No, If the corner falls in by itself, that&#x27;s a slightly better position<br>
than if I have to then put it in myself, because then it only takes only<br>
6.3 moves average to reshuffle the LL edges instead of 8.5 when I&#x27;m<br>
doing it with the corner.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to, you could learn algorithms to insert the corner with<br>
the edge while orienting the LL edges (8.2 moves), then reshuffle the LL<br>
edges separately (6.3) moves. That would actually take slightly more<br>
moves on average: 14.5 instead of 14.4 (it takes me 5.9 moves to insert<br>
the last F2L edge and orient the LL edges, and 8.5 moves to insert the<br>
last F2L corner and reshuffle the LL edges).<br>
<br>
It is not much of a difference in terms of moves. But there is a HUGE<br>
difference in the number of algorithms required. There are 124 (symmetry<br>
reduced) algorithms to learn for inserting the last F2L corner/edge and<br>
simultaneously orienting LL edges, plus two more to reshuffle edges. For<br>
my method, there are only 16 algorithms to learn and that includes<br>
reshuffling the edges. Because orientation is done at a much easier<br>
time, no algorithms are required for that. It is very easy to insert the<br>
last F2L edge while orienting the LL edges, because you are just<br>
focusing on edges and you don&#x27;t have to worry about destroying the<br>
corner.<br>
<br>
To compare different approaches:<br>
<br>
f2l+edge ori(8.2) + edges(6.3)      + corners(12.48) = 26.98 (167 algs)<br>
redges(5.9)       + corn+edges(8.5) + corners(12.48) = 26.88 (57 algs)<br>
f2l+edge ori(8.2) + ll(12.83)                        = 21.03 (300 algs)<br>
<br>
f2l+edge ori means insert last f2l pair and orient LL edges.<br>
redges (ryan&#x27;s edges) means insert f2l edge and orient LL edges.<br>
<br>
The only way I know to beat my number of moves is to learn 300<br>
algorithms. Note, all these figures are symmetry reduced (they&#x27;re the<br>
only figures I have). I do know that the 300 increases by more than 100<br>
algorithms if you treat inverses as distinct, but my 57 increases only<br>
by about 10.<br>
<br>
In my system, I spread the last layer work over (at the least) 3 steps,<br>
and so I also distribute the memorised sequences over 3 steps. Another<br>
advantage of this is that all of the cases come up more frequently and I<br>
can practice them more often. If all cases are concentrated into one or<br>
two steps, that means you might forget how to do rare cases, or when<br>
they come up you might take some time to access algorithms from your<br>
memory. I&#x27;d imagine with doing the LL in one step (with edges already<br>
oriented) that some cases would only occur once a week even if you cubed<br>
a lot. Maybe it is even less frequent (I&#x27;ll leave someone else to figure<br>
that out exactly).<br>

I am only just starting to practice speed cubing again now. For the past<br>
few years I haven&#x27;t practiced at all. I guess I&#x27;m under a minute :-) It<br>
will be interesting to see whether this system can work in speed cubing.<br>
You realise, though, that it is possible to apply the second half of my<br>
system to most other openings other people use. For example, it is<br>
possible to use this with the fridrich system as well as the petrus<br>
system. Those have already been proven to give sub-20 times.<br>
<br>
I think the number of moves is a limiting factor in how fast people get.<br>
Sure, it may take more &quot;thinking&quot; to get fewer moves, but what<br>
alternative is there? It is just a matter of training your mind to be<br>
able to think more quickly. I think that&#x27;s possible.<br>
<br>
Note that the 300 algorithm system uses fewer moves than mine, so maybe<br>
that will lead to more amazing times than mine. However, I still have a<br>
few improvements I plan to make - it is still in development. I<br>
definitely don&#x27;t plan to learn 300 algorithms (my memory is not that<br>
big), but there are other ways to economise on moves. I believe the key<br>
is to work on the last layer simultaneously with the first two layers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I found your post interesting, but I&#x27;d have to
disagree with one thing in particular: &quot;The pint is,
that this frenzied chase after averages and timers
rather spoils the fun, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;  First of
all, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a frenzied chase; I&#x27;d like
to consider it as working towards a goal.  Working
toward a goal in speedcubing doesn&#x27;t spoil the fun, it
creates it!  There is nothing more exhilarating than
reaching a goal that you have set for yourself.  &quot;A
frenzied chase&quot; makes it sound barbaric and purely
competetive.  I&#x27;m very competetive with one person: 
Myself.  And your frame of mind is what seperates you
from speed cubists, not your times.  I think someone
who averages 3 minutes can consider themselves a
speedcubist, depending on their attitude.  Take you
for example, your times are around 5 minutes avg. 
Everyone was there once, (or is still there) but your
thought is &quot;someone has to be the slowest&quot;.  If you
have accepted this frame of mind than maybe it&#x27;s
better that you only do cube art. Anyway, I&#x27;m done
typing almost.  I&#x27;m sorry if you found this reply to
be offensive in any way, shape, or form.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with the definition, but I do not solve the cube for speed. 
As a cube artist using the cube as art medium, I MUST be able to 
solve it. In order to use judicious twiddling to construct patterns, 
your cube must be silved. If I went to my neighbors and qsked trhem 
to please solve the cube for me, they would tell me to get lost. It 
us also very easy to mess up the cube in the twiddling process. If 
that happens, the cube myst be re-solved.

Make no mistake - cube artists must also be cubists. They do not have 
to be speed cubists.

too hard for most of you. Trouble is, that only the fastest is the 
winner. Suppose that you make a spectacularly short average, and 
smeone from the boondocks beat you to it by  fraction of a second? 
You will be frustrated and angry. I know I would.

Cube art is a new duscipline  on the Rubik&#x27;s cube spectrum.There are 
very few of us in the world today. But if you thini cube artists 
don&#x27;t have to be able to manipulate the cube, then think again! You 
can only use conventional twiddling to  achieve those pieces, that 
is, if you use the cube as art medium. 

No, I don&#x27;t feel offended by your reply. I expected something like it.

So I finished it just in time to mention it as an interesting aspect 
of the cube during a little lecture I was giving at my university on 
group theory of the cube. I only briefly mentioned it, and at the 
end some grad students couldn&#x27;t take their hands off it. One, 
claiming to be able to solve one, even drew diagrams to figure out 
the irregular color scheme I used, lol. (A professor questioned 
whether it would be EASIER, but I said that instead of getting 
stickers to where you want them, you would be trying to get stickers 
out of a certain face.)

Has anyone else out there envisioned or created such a cube?

<br>
I never did this intentionally, but when I originally got my <br>
megaminx, tiles would occasionally fall off, and I wouldn&#x27;t put them <br>
back on right away.  I could still solve it, as long as no two pieces <br>
looked the same (e.g. two edges from the same face lost their other <br>
color).<br>
<br>
That said, I would expect that out of a total of 3x3x6=54 stickers, <br>
you would need only 31, if I figured it right.  Here&#x27;s my thinking:<br>
-Two adjacent center stickers (e.g.. D&amp;F) can set the cube&#x27;s <br>
orientation (-4)<br>
-One color can be completely replaced by &quot;unstickered&quot; (U = up = <br>
unstickered for simplicity) (-8)<br>
-Corners opposite U only need the D color, and one of the other <br>
stickers (-4)<br>
-One of the D corners only needs the D color, position being defined <br>
by the other D corners (-1)<br>
-Edges opposite U need the D color, but 1 can do without the other <br>
sticker (-1)<br>
-One of the U corners can be left completely unstickered because <br>
position and orientation are defined by the rest of the corners (-2)<br>
-The U corner diagonally opposite the unstickered corner needs only <br>
one sticker (-1)<br>
-One of the U edges can be left completely unstickered, being set by <br>
the other edges (-1)<br>
-One of the middle layer edges on the same face as the completely <br>
unstickered edge can go without it&#x27;s other color (e.g. If UF is <br>
without stickers, FR can lose its R sticker, or FL can lose it&#x27;s L <br>
sticker) (-1)<br>
<br>
54-4-8-4-1-1-2-1-1-1 = 54 - 23 = 31<br>
<br>
Is this the number you came up with?<br>

I stand corrected (after talking with someone else).  My previous <br>
solution to your puzzle assumes that we also want a unique solved <br>
state for the cube.  If you are allowed to have multiple solved <br>
states, then each piece merely needs to be unique.  In this case you <br>
need just 26 stickers:<br>
- 6 edges have 1 sticker (one of each color)<br>
- 5 edges have 2 stickers (all unique pairings)<br>
- 1 edge is unstickered<br>
- 6 corners have 1 sticker (one of each color)<br>
- 1 corner has 2 stickers<br>
- 1 corner is unstickered<br>
- 2 centers have stickers<br>
<br>
6*1 + 5*2 + 6*1 + 1*2 + 2*1 = 6 + 10 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 26<br>
<br>
This will still offer 43 quintillion unique configurations, but there <br>
will be multiple possible solved states.  Here&#x27;s a new puzzle for <br>
you - given a cube with 26 stickers, how many different ways can it <br>
be solved?  I don&#x27;t know, but it would probably depend on the <br>
configuration of the stickers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I&#x27;ve been speedcubing for a while now, (36.5 second average) but <br>
&gt; everytime that I come across the N permuation (according to <br>
&gt; Jessica) <br>
&gt; I get a far worse time. That permutation takes my more than 10 <br>
&gt; seconds to do usually!  I use the algorithm that Jess Bond has in <br>
&gt; his tutorials on his website.  <br>
&gt; <br>

I&#x27;ve got a video showing how I do it here:<br>

My goal has never been to get into Guinness.  And I
think it&#x27;s safe to say that&#x27;s not the goal of the
majority of speedcubists.

Once again, the ultimate goal is not to be extremely
competetive and beat everyone.

I wouldn&#x27;t be bitter about it.  I would probably
invite them to dinner with some fellow cubers to
discuss methods or something.

I wouldn&#x27;t be frustrated and angry...but you probably
would be.

You&#x27;re right, cube art is on the rubik&#x27;s spectrum. 
But it&#x27;s so far away from speedcubing that its almost
astonishing.  I wouldn&#x27;t neccessarily call it a new
discipline, because I&#x27;ve seen cube art.  It&#x27;s not
complicated at all.  I believe there are few cube
artists because its too simple.  (but thats what i
believe not everyone else)  I&#x27;m confident that if i
had 500 extra cubes sitting around I could replicate
any cube art I&#x27;ve seen so far.

If you think about it, people who only know how to
scramble a cube are capable of manipulating it.  The
cube is an interesting thing to use as an art medium. 
Some people make art with mashed potatoes.

          <div class="email-content">I think I&#x27;d probably put the mark at a few minutes (maybe 2-3 
minutes?) to be called a speedcuber. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m basing this 
on, it was just what popped into my head when I read the post. Maybe 
I&#x27;m thinking this because (in my mind) the maximum time it would take 
someone to solve the cube if they were using an inefficient method 
and going fast enough to show that they have a some knowledge of 
speedcubing, but not the sort of speed attained when algs have 
embedded themself into the subconscious or when fingertricks are 
applied.

So, if we imagine someone using a layer-by-layer-by-layer method with 
a 4-6 look LL (as opposed to, say, a cross/F2L/LL method with a 2 
look LL), it would often take 120+ turns. FYI, I&#x27;m basing this on 
figures from an inefficient method that I learnt years ago. If they 
were turning at an average of, say, around 0.75 turns/sec, this would 
take 160 seconds, ie. between 2-3 minutes.

On the point of &#x27;going for speed&#x27;. It&#x27;s clearly a factor, but if 
someone was working on getting their times from 1 hr down to 1/2 hr, 
I wouldn&#x27;t think them worthy of the title &#x27;speedcuber&#x27;!  Maybe they 
are just a &#x27;cuber&#x27;? Or &#x27;speed-cuber-in-training&#x27;?  :)

Here are some thoughts... BTW, I just made up these titles, but you 
probably get the idea:

SpeedCubingGod:   can regularly solve in 15-20 seconds
UberSuperSpeedCuber:   can regularly solve in 20-30 seconds
SuperSpeedCuber:   can regularly solve in 30-45 seconds
SpeedCuber (1st class):   can regularly solve in 45-60 seconds
SpeedCuber (2nd class):   can regularly solve in 1-2 minutes
SpeedCuber (3rd class):   can regularly solve in 2-3 minutes
Cuber:  can regularly solve in 3-10 minutes
Cuber-in-training:  can regularly solve in 10-30 minutes
TryhardCuber:   those people who claim that they can solve it but it 
takes them a day or two. I&#x27;m skeptical of these people. I kinda think 
that if you can do it, then you can do it in minutes (even if 30 
minutes). I hope I haven&#x27;t just offended anyone!!!  :/

Geez, I really rambled on there didn&#x27;t I??

          <div class="email-content">I remember a few years back, i found a cube at a friends house (first time i<br>
had seen one since 83), and tried to see if i could still solve it.<br>
<br>
i got the first 2 layers, and after some fiddling i managed the top edges,<br>
but i had troubles with the corners.<br>
after some more fiddling i found an algo that rotated 3 corners. since one<br>
of my edge moving algos flipped one or more corners, in theory i could<br>
complete the cube by a combination of those algos.<br>
<br>
I didnt bother writing down the algos to figure out what combinations i had<br>
to make to get it complete, but just sat there for a while doing those algos<br>
until it was solved.<br>
<br>
i tried it again a few days later and made it again after a while. i think<br>
this would qualify as someone that can solve the cube, but it might take a<br>
long time. i didnt try the cube again until this spring.<br>

where those Bohemians think that, by slapping a Rubik&#x27;s cube on 
paper, they have created a first-class cube art masterpiece. Nothing 
could be more false. Because it is a new discipline, there are really 
no rules as to what constitutes cube art. Read about it in 
rubikschamps.com, what I define as cube art. It is a form that uses 
Rubik&#x27;s cube as art medium. I repeat, ART MEDIUM. That means the art 
pieces are made from Rubik&#x27;s cubes.

Therefore, to manipulate the cube means more, than just scrambling 
it. In terms of 3d cube art you have to:
	Solve it  and that means solve it completely. You `paint&#x27; 
patterns on each solved cube by judicious twiddling. If the cube is 
not solved, you have a problem. If your neighbor is a speed cubist, 
you can ask him for help. However, I am not fortunate enough to have 
such a neighbor. As I need to learn judicious twiddling anyway, I 
might as well learn how to solve the cube. End of justification.
	Do judicious twiddling  you speed cubists use it all the 
time, except you call it F2L,LL, etc, etc.All that speed aside, 
basically what you are  doing is to get the identity element of the 
Rubik&#x27;s cube group. Once I get that element I use certain prescribed 
sequences to get another symmetric element  a pattern on the cube 
that will participate in a design.
	Use parity pairs and parity-pair induced design symmetries- 
what? You have never herd of them? No mention is made of those pairs 
n speed cubing, but they are extremely important in 3d designs. You 
see, you deal only with one cube, but this property applies to two 
cubes, a pair.  If you come to Toronto and condescend to stop by my 
exhibit, I will tell you what that is.
	Use color control just to make sure the cubes color-
synchronize properly, a part of judicious twiddling.
	Fractals is just a sub problem of the design problem, will 
speak about it, if you are interested.
What do you think now? Is this more or less complicated than speed 
cubing? THAT is what will be presented in Toronto.

May I ask you a favor? You said that you saw some cube art.  Based on 
that, you evidently came to your conclusions.  What type of art did 
you see?  Could you produce a website of that art?  I to, saw a few 
pieces. The one, which left me in stitches, was a picture of a guy 
holding 4 cubes with a letter on each cube. The message was SHIT. 
That is roughly equivalent to putting a DO NOT DISTURB message on 
your door and calling it art. I would hope I am doing somewhat better 
than that.

          <div class="email-content">I completely agree with your figures for the centers and edges. I 
don&#x27;t know about the corners, but your probably correct. I am still 
trying to figure out if it works, since it is different from what I 
concluded. It is kind of hard to visualize what my cube looks like 
with out certain stickers.

However, I believe we&#x27;re under different criteria. I had two 
additional criteria (that are most likely mutually dependent on each 
other) that I thought was assumed, but am now proven wrong. First, I 
did want a unique solved position, which is equivalent to saying 
that the stickering scheme FORCES a certain, predetermined color 
scheme. Secondly, it shouldn&#x27;t have more then one solved postion (to 
address the other possibility in your other post). I think the two 
are probably equivalent conditions since they are so inter-related.

That second post does pose and gives rise to an EXTREMELY difficult 
challenge - How many &quot;solved&quot; positions are there for a given 26 
stickering with the broader criteria? Which 26 stickering(s) 
maximizes/minimizes this number?.

So what I am left to determine is whether your 31 solution forces a 
color scheme. It is only the corners I care about now, but you don&#x27;t 
explicitly specify how many edges are fully stickered. Form this I 
can determine how much adjacency is already forced.

hemm, hope nobody poses the same questions on larger cubes)

          <div class="email-content">I think 2 minutes is a good place to put the mark, but this is 
purely an opinion (so no offense please). From my experience 
(nothing compared to those that started during the rage), when I was 
first able to solve the cube consistatly (I don&#x27;t remember my 
randomly solving phase lasting for longer then 1 week), I was able 
to obtain sub-2min times with no more then ten simple algorithms, 
poor dexterity, and no outside resources/help (till maybe 1:20). 
Perhaps, it was my recognition that allowed for these 
good &#x27;beginner&#x27; times, reaction times that eventually got me to 
where my times are today. Then again, many would agree: recognition 
is developed through practice.

So someone who is not achieving under the 2min mark and wants to be 
a speedcubist is probably lacking in one of these attributes (that 
may or maynot be under their control): dexterity, recognition, 
memory, memory recall, or most likely lack of motivation and/or 
practice. (I am having some joint problems myself currently; somehow 
I got that idea that since I &#x27;can&#x27; solve over 1,000 cubes in one 
day, I should do it. Advice, don&#x27;t do something just because you 
can, lol.)

Also, what do you suppose would qualify as a blindfold cubist? I am 
getting to around 40% of doing this feat, is that enought for me to 
use this title? Again, this is up to ones opinion.

-Doug 

P.S.  some people think I don&#x27;t post enough, so I will be rambling 
on from time to time and perhaps contribute something occasionally

P.S.S. the metronome thing was a big failure on my part, one turn 
for each tick even at 50 beats/min is too much for me, but I can 
still regularly solve in about 22s. I suppose I solve in bursts, 8 
to be exact.

Okay, for this contest, there are competitions...  You DON&#x27;T have to compete in each one, it&#x27;s just a variety of things to keep it interesting.  The first 4 are always permenant, but the fifth changes every wednesday.<br>
1) HandiCap<br>
2) Most moves a minute<br>
3) To solve any cube in the largest number of people<br>
4) One hand-frenzy<br>
**5)** The weekly contest, which changes every week (every wednesday of course).<br>
 <br>
People get ranked by the point system explained on the site.  I hope this makes sense :)  If you have any other problems let me know! ;)<br>

Ne did not say so. However, I  know how to do it, at least  for 
opposite clors. You do a diagonal that starts from the lower left-
hand corner and proceds to the upper right hand corner. With the cube 
in this position you do L2 R2 U2 L2 R2 D2. This combination produces 
letter S.

Hi danG, thanks for joining this community discussion.<br>
<br>
There was also another concern that I expressed. Since rubikschamps.com<br>
is a commercial entity, there is no guarantee that we will not have to<br>
subscribe to marketing in the future. Can you guarantee this?<br>
<br>
I noticed I must join the Rubik&#x27;s Club in order to have my unofficial<br>
record appear on this new records list. Surely we need only be a member<br>
of our own community to post a record to our own record list. I don&#x27;t<br>
see the Rubik&#x27;s Club as having necessary part of this. Isn&#x27;t commercial<br>
interest sneaking its way into our community records list? Does Rubik&#x27;s<br>
Club want to advertise their latest commercial offerings to us?<br>
<br>
You might try to convince me that the Rubik&#x27;s Club is a good thing so I<br>
should not argue about joining it. But let&#x27;s do things the proper way<br>
and let people join the Rubik&#x27;s Club only if they want to. And more<br>
importantly, let&#x27;s preserve our community. Let&#x27;s maintain the feeling it<br>
has always had by keeping commercial interests separate from it.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Ryan<br>
<br>
PS. I&#x27;m not against commercial entities. I may even join Rubik&#x27;s Club.<br>
But I think that the commercial side should be run separately from the<br>
community side.<br>

You&#x27;re right. We have the right to maintain our own records list, no<br>

Ok, I might be alone on this. I will not be posting records on<br>
rubikschamp.com, but I understand that other people will not have a<br>
problem signing up with rubiks.com first. I am disappointed that there<br>
is no alternative to rubikschamps.com, though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,
Sure it is not a good think to have two record site. But the Record 
pages is not only for 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. Are you sure 
rubikschamps.com is willing to post ALL the records even if it is not 
a Rubik&#x27;s puzzle? 

I will ask Ron (he is on holiday) what the status will be of the 
record pages in the future.

This one is very different to any others you may have seen, as it <br>
includes a Kociemba solver, a choice of viewing modes, and a choice <br>

Full list of changes:<br>
UPDATED 06/07/2003. Added Cubie, a new Rubik&#x27;s Cube Java Applet. New <br>
pages about the Circle Puzzle, Rotos, and the Zauberkreuz. Expanded <br>
the Lights Out pages with more info on the Deluxe, the theory of lit-<br>
only games and toggle games, as well as solutions. Added JavaScript <br>
for the Circle Puzzle, Zauberkreuz, and Rotos. Added dreamball, <br>

          <div class="email-content">All,

please be advised that i have no involvement with the content on 
Rubiks.com other than the wc2003 championships.

Its all the sponsors doing. not mine.....

As to the records lists. I suspect Ron will keep his records list on 
the speedcubing.com site but I am not 100 percent sure.Let wait til 
he returns before assuming...

We can have as many lists as we want. Please dont worry about the 
legalities on the rubikschamps site.

If you all have privacy issues etc like myself then hey, dont submit 
any records then....easy as that....

But after reading all the comments on this forum about the rubiks 
champs site, please by all means send your voices and opinions to 
the respective folks on rubikschamps....If they dont see your 
concerns then nothing will happen...

each part of rubiks champs has a person who answers certain types of 
questions...

if its regarding the rules for the event then i get the email...if 
its for the record list then patrick hess gets the email...if your 
concern is about privacy then Dave Jones from Seventowns gets the 
email...etc etc

What we did with the rubiks champs is created a forum for you all to 
voice your concerns so by all means send them in to 
rubikschamps....we also have implemented many items to &quot;protect&quot; the 
rubiks name hence all the privacy items and legalities imposed on 
the site...

This way you get heard by more than just myself.....you now have all 
the sponsors(licensee&#x27;s and licensor) listening(BUT PLEASE KEEP IT 
PROFESSIONAL).

I guess the biggest thing i have read on this forum is the privacy 
issues which i have brought forth to Seventowns as I personally have 
issues with that...All in all, Its their product and we all have to 
abide by certain standards and rules etc that they want to 
implement...

What we all are able to do now it voice our concerns for 
change....Which took be 3 years to set the platform for you all to 
step up with your issues.

Now that its all in place lets use it to our advantage.

I personally dont like the fact that they want the right to use my 
name and personal info to their advantage without compensation or 
royalty for myself....

Its all issues i am fighting for us all on ......

But we can all be happy because in 6 weeks wc2003 will be reality 
and i can now say we are doing this all again in 2005 with myself 
stepping away from this organiser role(which i never want to do 
again) and coming back into competitor mode where i belong..

Minh Thai recently had an an interview with rubikschamps.com. Read 
it; the bottom line is he is not coming to Toronto to compete. Too 
busy with work and family, he says.

Erno Rubik is still alive, but, according to the sponsors, he does 
not want tio be pestered by people. I would like to ask him, if he 
knows anybody, who creates 3d designs. Nobody else seems to know. :-(

          <div class="email-content">On the Rubikschamps.com site:
What is Minh Thai up to these days? Well, RUBIKS.COM found out 
through an interview via email that he is still cubing away. 
However, he states that the time of 22.95 seconds &quot;will be very 
difficult, if not physically impossible to beat&quot; as part of his 
responses to a variety of questions asked by RUBIKS.COM.
Won&#x27;t he be feeling a bit annoyed when Jessica or Ron or someone 
beats 22.95 by nearly ten seconds, and get&#x27;s a 15 second time? LOL I 
don&#x27;t understand how he could possibly think that 22.95 seconds 
would be hard to beat.
By the way, I finally beat his record (22.95) yesterday. It made me 
feel happy inside. Now I only need to get a sub-20 time, and I&#x27;ll 
feel much better.

          <div class="email-content">clarification!!!

the film documentary that is being produced has no involvement with 
the championships and it is not about the history of the 
cube...FYI...

the documentary is about 1 man&#x27;s adventure bringing the world most 
famous puzzle back to life and one groups adventure in the search 
for god&#x27;s algortyhm.

the gaming show company you read about is there to shoot the event 
for an upcoming unusual gaming show out in LA.

The finale will be webcasted and filmed however only the web cast 
will be &quot;live&quot; and that of tv stattions wishing to film..

but it will not be on tv the same time as the event...

described some of those concepts there under another name. Is there a 
glossary of those cube terms somewhere? This is a new field, and its 
terminology should be standardized.

You are correct that you can only deduce the remaining colors on a <br>
cube from two adjacent centers&#x27; stickers if you know the color <br>
scheme.  However, in reference to my solution, there are other pieces <br>
to look at for determining the colors of the remaining faces, so <br>

&gt; comes? Is a BOY-cube the same as a BOW-cube?<br>
<br>
Actually, I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that all the middles were set, but <br>
that the cube orientation was set based on two adjacent centers - <br>
BOY/BOW cubes are not the same, but both can be determined in the <br>
same way, assuming that other pieces on the cube also have stickers.<br>
<br>
If you remove all the stickers from the center pieces, any center <br>
could be U (6 possibilities) and any center adjacent to that could be <br>
F (4 possibilities), leaving 6*4 = 24 possible cube orientations.<br>
<br>
Putting a sticker on one of the centers restricts the rest of the <br>
face to that same color, but leaves four possibilities for the <br>
surrounding faces.<br>
<br>
By finally adding a sticker to one of the four adjacent faces, the <br>
cube orientation is set and the colors of the rest of the faces can <br>
be deduced through inspection of the other pieces (corners and edges) <br>
on the cube.<br>

No, there is no cube art group I could be &#x27;banished&#x27; to. Unless a

otherwise it&#x27;s censorship.

Does anyone know what happened to the cube-lovers mailing list? And, is<br>
anyone interested in starting it up again?<br>
<br>
The cube-lovers mailing list discussed a wide range of topics relating<br>
to the cube, including the mathematics of the cube, the relationship<br>
between the cube and science, cube art, algorithms for solving the cube<br>
in the fewest moves, and yes, even speed cubing. (Only cube religion is<br>
missing from this list, yet it is the one that everybody worships!)<br>
<br>
Since there is no cube-lovers mailing list at the moment, those people<br>
interested in mathematics, cube art, and solving the cube in the fewest<br>
moves, have had no choice but to join this community here. I also wonder<br>
whether our discussions would be as interesting if those people left.<br>
Personally, I am interested in all topics relating to the cube if they<br>
can increase my understanding of the cube. Really, in the end, a better<br>
understanding of the cube may help you in speed cubing.<br>

pointless. Basically, you are ranting against people  you really

I am not saying, that your message is offensive, far from that. But

Oh, yes, *please*!  Maybe we can start a yahoo group called &quot;cube-<br>
lovers&quot; and hijack the name, since it&#x27;s been so inactive for so long.<br>
<br>
Obligatory speedcubing content:  there&#x27;s all these &quot;methods&quot; with all <br>
these &quot;algorithms&quot;---and I hate memorizing.  On the other hand, some <br>
algorithms just make sense in that they are logically clear; one such <br>
is the algorithm to twist two corners:<br>
<br>
   r-d+r+f+d+f- u+ f+d-f-r-d-r+ u-<br>
<br>
So what method requires the fewest algorithms that aren&#x27;t &quot;obvious&quot; <br>
or logically clear?  If I solve top corners, bottom corners, three <br>
top edges, three bottom edges, last top/bottom edge, then the middle <br>
edges, the only non-obvious algorithm I need is one to swap a pair of <br>
bottom corners.<br>
<br>
(Of course, this isn&#x27;t really *speed* cubing, but I bring it up <br>
because I used to sort-of speed cube back in 1981 and thereabouts, <br>
but in the intervening 20 years I&#x27;ve forgotten *all* the nonobvious <br>
algorithms.  It took me quite a while to even solve the cube again <br>
for the first time because I couldn&#x27;t flip those bottom corners!)<br>

If there is a topic you wish to discuss, or feel has been missing, I 
encourage you to post a message about it.  I suspect many of us 
(silent majority? ;)) lurk waiting to read messages that interest us. 
If a message generates absolutely no replies, then perhaps that would 
be a signal to start a new group (based on that topic, not the 
cube).  But if it is even vaguely related to the cube, it&#x27;ll probably 
get some interest.

I also got spammed about the cubes.

I emailed them back asking for more info, avalibility/prices ya 
know.  They replied back saying the cubes are not into production 
yet, but the design is proven and can be made wayy cheaper than the 
larger cubes that are on the market today.  Also they said it would 
stand up to speedcubing perfectly.  They also said the email was an 
attempt to get someone to pay for the patent, so then they can start 
making the cube.

It is similar to your algorithm to twist two corners.  In your<br>

It is impossible to swap two corners without affecting any edges, so my<br>

two of the corners in the correct place.<br>

r+u+r- (moves DFR corner to top layer)<br>

d- (rotates bottom layer to prepare for third corner)<br>
r+u+r- (puts second corner back in a different position on the bottom<br>

r+u-r- (puts third corner back in the first position on the bottom<br>

Using a simplified Thistlethwaite approach, it is possible to solve the
cube without any mysterious algorithms.

Step 1 uses no algorithms.
Step 2 uses a 5 move algorithm.
Step 3 uses a 7 move algorithm and a 4 move algorithm.
Step 4 uses two 6 move algorithms.

Because all algorithms are short and simple, someone who tries this
method can say they solved the cube and understood how they did it!

It&#x27;s not too easy to follow, but it&#x27;s an interesting way to solve the
cube if you can do it.

** step 1 **

Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F,B,U,D> group, which I will call G1. That is to
say, put the cube into a position where the cube can be solved by only
using L2,R2,F,B,U,D moves. It helps in this method to think of opposite
colours as the same colour up until you get to step 4. Let&#x27;s call the
left/right colours &quot;green&quot; (these are unimportant in step 1), the
up/down colours red, and the front/back colours white.

Once you get into G1, it is impossible to flip edges, and the only thing
we need to do to get the cube into G1 is to make sure all the edges are
flipped right. First you need to find bad edges that are flipped the
wrong way. A bad edge is one that, if moved to its home position using
only moves from G1, will be flipped the wrong way. (Of course, you don&#x27;t
need to move it there to see that)

There are always an even number of bad edges, between 0 and 12, or 6 on
average. The only way to flip edges to turn the left or right sides 90
degrees, and that will flip the 4 edges on that side. To flip 4 bad
edges, you simply move them all into positions on the left side (for
example), and turn that side 90 degrees. If you have only 2 bad edges,
you can make that into 4 by moving just one of them onto the left side
and turning it. That will change one of the bad edges into 3 (plus the
other one it makes 4).

At end of step 1, you should see no red edges facing to the front or
back, and you should see no white edges facing to the top or bottom. To
the untrained eye, it will look like you have accomplished nothing so
far! Yet, these 12 edges are in a much better position now.

** step 2 **

Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U,D> group, which I will call G2. In this
group, pieces in the middle layer will stay in the middle layer without
flipping, and pieces in the top and bottom layers can only exchange
between those layers without twisting or flipping. At the end of step 2,
you should only see red on the top and bottom. In the middle layer, you
should only see green on the left/right sides, and white on the
front/back sides.

Remember we are currently in G1, so to get to G2, we can only use moves
from G1. To start with the edges, we want to get a red cross on the top
and bottom. There are 8 red edges and because of limited space, at least
4 of those must already be forming part of the crosses. The general
strategy is to first get 3 red edges on the top and 3 edges on the
bottom, and align them so that the missing parts of both crosses are
facing to the front. The other 2 red edges must be somewhere in the
middle layer (if not, you must have 4 edges instead of 3 edges on the
top or bottom). Using double turns around the L2,R2,F2,B2 sides, move
those two remaining red edges over to the two front positions on the
middle layer, and turn the front 90 degrees. With the edges done, we
have created some symmetry so it is possible rotate the cube about the
U-D axis and change your perception of what is the front and back. Very
convenient.

Now for the corners, we can twist two corners at a time. Start with one
corner at LUF (corner A) and the other corner at FDR (corner B). Then
do:

R&#x27;D  - twists the B corner
L2   - swaps the B and A corners
D&#x27;R  - twists the A corner on the way back

Do this repeatedly until all corners are twisted the right way. You
should have all red on the top and bottom.

** step 3 **

Put cube into &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U2,D2> group, named G3. In the previous step,
you put only opposite colours on the top and bottom (red). In this step,
you do the same for the front/back (white) and left/right (green). In
G3, each corner can only move between one of 4 positions, which I call a
circuit. There are only two circuits and each corner belongs to one of
those circuits. Within G3, the only moves you can do (double turns) will
swap two corners in one circuit, and two corners in the other circuit
that overlap. This limits the permutations that are possible, and it
means that simply getting opposite colours on all sides is not enough to
satisfy G3.

Since the corners are the tricky bit here, we will put the corners into
G3 first, then the edges. You must now distinguish between opposite
colours to know if G3 is satisfied. I will use red opposite to orange,
white to yellow, and green to blue. An easy way to see if G3 is
satisfied is to move all red corners to the top side, and all orange
corners to the bottom side. Pairs of corners around the top and bottom
will either match or mismatch. If they either all match, or they all
mismatch, the corners are in a G3 position. There is only one way for
all corners to match, and one way for all corners to mismatch (you swap
a pair of opposite corners), and so when the exact pattern occurs on the
top and bottom, the bottom corners should align exactly with the top
corners.  You can switch between all matched, and none matched, by doing
R2L2R2 (that swaps a pair of opposite corners on the bottom, and a pair
of opposite corners on the top). If you&#x27;re not in either of those
positions, here is a sequence that will swap a pair of opposite corners
on the bottom, and an adjacent pair of corners on the top:

R&#x27;FR&#x27; - move the 4 target corners to the back side
B2    - swap!
RF&#x27;R  - move everything back

This is one case where it is more efficient to temporarily break G2. At
the end of the move, everything is restored. This move sequence will
do swapping on the bottom side, and at the rear/back. The front/top pair
of corners will be left alone. When you are looking for corners that
match or mismatch, you will usually find a pair that are not like the
rest of the pairs (eg. if all the other pairs match, this pair will
mismatch). If you find this odd pair and hold it at the top/front, doing
the above sequence will harmonise all the corners.

Now for the edges, there is nothing special here. The edges also lie on
circuits, but there are 12 edges and 3 circuits. The edges in the middle
layer were already done in step 2 and haven&#x27;t left their circuit. There
are only 8 edges left do deal with, and we must move the white edges to
the white sides (front/back), ie. into their circuit, and the green
edges to the green sides (left/right). There must be an even number of
edges that are facing in the wrong direction. The easiest move to do
here is to swap two edges on the green sides for two edges on the white
sides. The edges on the greens side must be positioned on the bottom,
and the edges on the white sides must be positioned on the top. Then do:

D&#x27;
M2 (M is the slice between L and R) - swap!
D

This is self explanatory. Like in step 1, if you only have 2 bad edges,
you can make it into 4 in a similar way.

At the end of this step, you should only have two (opposite) colours on
each side of the cube.

Step 4.

The cube can now be solved by only using double turns. However, we will
break this rule when we see an obvious short cut.

First, using only double turns, solve the corners. First, pick a side,
then join two corners on that side and the other two corners for that
side will automatically join (if you did step 3 properly). It is then
easy to join the two pairs together, and the other 4 corners will be
automatically joined (if you did step 3 properly).

To solve the edges, there are two simple moves that are easy to
understand:

F2R2 F2R2 F2R2 - Swap two pairs of edges on different circuits. The
                 other pieces return to normal.

F2 M2 F2 M2    - Swap two pairs of edges on the same circuit. The second
                 F2 returns the other pieces back to normal.

Using variations of these, it is possible to solve all the edges.
Variations of the first include:

R     (F2R2 F2R2 F2R2)      R&#x27;
L2B2R (F2R2 F2R2 F2R2) R&#x27;B2L2

Variations of the second include:

F2 M F2 M&#x27; (the pairs overlap so as to rotate 3 edges)
F (F2 M2 F2 M2) F&#x27;

Thanks for all those links... I already checked out Fridrich&#x27;s page 
and Lars Petrus&#x27; page (I prefer Fridrich&#x27;s system so far, seems more 
streamlined to me). I&#x27;ll definitely give the others a look over, too.

Without using memorized algorithms, I used to form a cross on the 
top, solve 3 corners in the top, solve 3 edges in the middle, solve 
all remaining edge pieces, permute all remaining corner pieces, 
orient all remaining corner pieces.

If you just go along with that order it should be pretty obvious how 
to do everything.

I don&#x27;t use that method at all anymore, though... I haven&#x27;t actually 
solved the cube once since I started memorizing Fridrich&#x27;s 
algorithms. Just practice, practice, practicing those algs.

Thanks again for the links! :)

          <div class="email-content">This is very insightful, as with many of your other posts. If 
impemented this method could be very useful for speed cubing, with 
an extended algorithm set for each step of course. It&#x27;s good due to 
it&#x27;s low number of moves, however I think recognition could be 
killer. I have practiced rapid determination of flipped edges for 
blindfold cubing, but would probably still have trouble doing this 
kind of stuff in speedcubing mode. It is fun (and perhaps a good 
exercise) to solve in the &lt;U2,D2,F2,B2,R2,L2> generated group 
though. You are comming to Toronto, right? This article makes me 
want to use my site to host various insightful articles from 
experienced cubists, with due credit of course. I&#x27;ve only seen this 
on 1 or 2 sites, and believe that a categorized repository would be 
great to have. If not for anything else, then just to minimize that 
random repetitive, annoying posts we have that get the same answer 
the first dozen times it was asked: for instance &quot;I am new at 
cubing, what resources/method do you people suggest?&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t 
solve the cube, teach me/tell me your secrets?&quot;. I could look up the 
answers various people post here and collect them in one place.

You sort of imply that most speedcubist don&#x27;t truly understand how 
they do it when using a highly structured method. I don&#x27;t agree with 
this, at least I hope it is not the case. It would be sad to have a 
sub-20 cubist not understand the entirety of their method or 
algorithms and be blindly applying algorithms and a method found on 
the net.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone.<br>
<br>
On the weekend I did my first public speedcubing, in front of about 120 <br>
people.  It is a bit different from doing it on your own, in the living <br>
room!<br>
<br>
It was a pretty relaxed atmosphere (everyone there was from my church) but <br>
that did not seem to stop me getting very nervous.  I started with a bit of <br>
patter, which seemed to help wind them up a bit, so that was good.  I <br>
wondered if it might be possible to solve it in under a minute, which gave <br>
me tons of breathing space.  I got someone to scramble, and someone else to <br>
give a 15 second countdown and then time with a stopwatch.<br>
<br>
In one sense it was a bit of a disaster, because I ended up having to do one <br>
f2l slot twice, and a three-look LL (yikes!).  But that is not how I feel at <br>
all: I didn&#x27;t chicken out even though beforehand I sort of wanted to, I did <br>
it in 33 seconds, which is not a very good time for me, but in the end is <br>
not the point at all: it just felt great to be up there, doing something <br>
that no one else there could even conceive of doing themselves!  It was fun, <br>
and I really enjoyed myself!<br>
<br>
So hooray!<br>
Happy speedcubing everybody!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Speedcubing in public is usually tough at first, because you&#x27;re so 
nervous. I do it a lot, though, so I&#x27;m used to it. Also I&#x27;m a 
magician, so performing in front of a lot of people is regular for 
me. :)

This name defies logic. If this topic is so unique and rare, why have 
a special grouop for it?
As I said, all those trends hatve one thing in common - they re rew
related to the Rubik&#x27;s cube.

Being out of sync with the group, I am afraid I
cannot answeryour questions offhand. During the last cbe craze I have 
heard of a cbe pendant, a gold affair, whose tiles were colored 
gemstones. The price was n the millions as I recall. For  earrings 
you will need two smaller Rubik&#x27;s cubes. Please do me a favor....mak 
it a parity pair.

          <div class="email-content">Since there has been some heated debate about this lately I feel it&#x27;s <br>
time I jump in and say something.  First of all I started this group <br>
because I was completely obsessed with the cube at the time and <br>
thought it would be cool if I could start a group and have others <br>
join.  I had NO IDEA that it would get as many members as it has <br>
now.  The reason I named the group &quot;Speed Solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; is <br>
because I wanted to draw in the attention of other cubists, not just <br>
have another &quot;hey I&#x27;m into the cube too...&quot; kind of group.  So anyway <br>
my original goal with this group was to try to gather as many people <br>
as I could who were interested in the cube.  The speed solving part <br>
was just an attention-getter.  So I must say I&#x27;m dissapointed that <br>
the discussion environment sometimes isn&#x27;t as open as I originally <br>
intended it.  Since this is the case, I would like to change the name <br>
of this group to promote this more open discussion, and have those <br>
who do not wish to participate in the more diversified discussion <br>
start their own group on whatever specific topic they wish.  Now this <br>
is just my opinion.  So the purpose of this message is to ask all of <br>
you what you want to do.  I can either change the name of this group <br>
to Cube Lovers or something to that affect, or we can keep this group <br>
as speed solving rubik&#x27;s cube and start another group where topics <br>
such as the math of the cube, art, and any other interesting topics <br>
can be discussed.<br>
<br>
I absolutely do not want this group&#x27;s discussion to be limited to <br>
just speed cubing and I would like to change it&#x27;s name.  What are <br>
everyone&#x27;s opinion&#x27;s on this?<br>

&gt; I absolutely do not want this group&#x27;s discussion to be limited to <br>
&gt; just speed cubing and I would like to change it&#x27;s name.  What are <br>
&gt; everyone&#x27;s opinion&#x27;s on this?<br>
<br>
I personally think everything should be left as is.  It&#x27;s nice to <br>
have all the cube related discussions in one place, especially since <br>
discussion on speed-cubing can lead to questions/discussion on math <br>
or other topics.  Besides, I think it&#x27;s nice not to have to follow <br>
several different groups.<br>
<br>
I know that other groups that have been started in the past have <br>
failed to gain momentum.  For example, look at the world championship <br>
group.  In theory, all world championship related discussions and <br>
questions are supposed to be posted over there, but they end up here <br>
instead.  Why?  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably because this is the greatest <br>
concentration of people &quot;in the know&quot; when it comes to anything cube <br>
related, be it speed specific or not.<br>
<br>
I think the problem, here, is that people are getting sick of hearing <br>
about certain types of &quot;off topic&quot; content and forget that they <br>
themselves talk about quite a bit that is not actually within the <br>
context of &quot;speed cubing&quot; proper.  I say if there&#x27;s a discussion you <br>
don&#x27;t want to hear about, then skip over it - don&#x27;t even bother <br>
reading it.  The name should still be SpeedSolvingRubiksCube, because <br>
in general, that&#x27;s probably the main focus/goal of most people once <br>
they can solve the cube (get an interest in being able to do so).  I <br>
think it describes our &quot;community&quot; well, and should stay, as well as <br>
the discussion that isn&#x27;t necessarily focused on the &quot;speed&quot; part of <br>
the name.  Besides, like you said - it&#x27;s a good attention getter.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have to agree as well, the name is fine.  I think the problem is 
that the topics that are being discussed are quite interesting but

I think we all can get along without changing the name. We just need

though)

As far as Cube art goes, Hana, as you said, you are the minority and 
that is sad, I like that you have joined this group and are active in 
it, but i think you just have to simir down your cube art tangents in 
a &quot;non cube art&quot; discussion to a low roar.  I think that is whats 
peeving everyone, for ex.  when your concentrating on the posts for 
memorization tips, and then out of the middle no where someone 
says, &quot;well i don&#x27;t need to memorize anything for cube art&quot;  well 
that kind of bums some people out.  And i shouldn&#x27;t be aiming this 
just at you Hana, there are plenty others that like to include their 
own spin offs, (I raise my hand high as well)....

As far as others go, we are lucky to have a group to discuss certain 
aspects of the cube, and this is not a battlefield of pety diferences 
and such.  If you have a problem with something or someone just email 
them privately.

No. I would like to, but Toronto is on the other side of the planet, and<br>
that&#x27;s too far to travel for someone who is not competing.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Because all algorithms are short and simple, someone who tries this<br>

&gt; You sort of imply that most speedcubist don&#x27;t truly understand how <br>

&gt; this, at least I hope it is not the case.<br>
<br>
For me, at least, it is true. Although I would like to understand how<br>
all my final step algorithms work, I don&#x27;t. Some of them are just too<br>
complicated. Of course, the philosophy of my system is to reduce the<br>
mysterious part as much as possible so that you can participate more in<br>
the solving of the cube.<br>

I vote for the second. If we are to start up the cube-lovers mailing<br>
list again, it has to be a continuation of the original, out of respect<br>
for one of the oldest and longest running mailing lists in the history<br>
of the Internet. If we simply renamed this Yahoo group to cube-lovers,<br>
it would not be the same list that it was. Not only that, an *important*<br>
historical fact about cube-lovers was that it was a &quot;mailing list&quot; and<br>
not a &quot;Yahoo Group&quot; :-) We should either ask someone at MIT if they<br>
could start it up again, or if there is no other option, I can probably<br>
host it here at progsoc.<br>

But.. if you want to rename this group, my suggestion is &quot;cubists&quot;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">it isnt bad to do F2L based on algs, in fact it can help you to grasp the concept better.  (In my opinion)  I just feel that if you do need to use algs to get the hang of it, then do so, but then start solving based on intuition...  this is when you will start seeing drastic improvement in your times.  That is how it was in my case anyway.  Another big help would be to solve some example cubes with other people either in the weekend chat or through yahoo messenger.

          <div class="email-content">If there is something I truly dislike, it is flame wars and heated <br>
discussions. I even more hate starting them. However, sometimes that <br>
is unavoidable in a group of diverse people and equally diverse <br>
opinions. I am a veteran of the USENET newsgroups, where flame wars <br>
habitually flare up. I sometimes got on and urged the combatants to <br>
please borrow some of my kostky and go twiddle with me. : -)<br>
<br>
Nothing like that, however, happened o me in cube-lovers mailing <br>
list. I joined it, hoping I would find some 3d designers. I found <br>
none, but the people there were nice and congenial. It was a very <br>
pleasant environment. Should MIT decide to start it again, of course <br>
I will join. I hope to see some academics there, math professors <br>
specializing in the mathematical aspects of the cube, and he like.  <br>
The speed cubist hotheads that attacked me should also join, if only <br>
to get an idea, how things are run correctly.<br>
<br>
When I made the suggestion about the name change, I was responding to <br>
a poster, who used the present to suggest that `off-topic&#x27; posts <br>
should not be tolerated. I replied, if the name is that important to <br>
him, why not change it to something more general, and suggested <br>
cube_lovers. I have read Chris&#x27;s post and various responses to it.  <br>
There are two alternatives: change the name or create another group.. <br>
On creating  the other group, I agree with Grant. This void would be <br>
filled, if they restarted cube lovers nailing list. I don&#x27;t know what <br>
this would take. Certainly MIT would have to agree to it. BTW, is <br>
anyone on this group from MIT, who could answer this question? What <br>
caused the MIT to discontinue cube lovers mailing list in the first <br>
place? Does that condition still exist or can it be corrected? MIT <br>
is  top school that likes to be top.<br>
<br>
Until something can be done about this, I am afraid you are stuck <br>
with me. : -(  But don&#x27;t despair. When my post comes to you from the <br>
server, just select it and press the DELETE key. Presto  the message <br>
that offends your sensibilities goes to the trashcan. Don&#x27;t forget to <br>
empty the trash.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hana, are you a member of cubism for fun?  They deal with rubik like 
puzzles and math behind them as well as non rubiks puzzles and 
stuff.  Its an interesting magazine.  The downside of the magazine is 
that you only get 3 a year, and the price is kinda high, but the 
information is fascinating!!!  I think that would be cool if someone 
started a mailing list and some articles.  We could have a small 
yearly fee, but send out monthly newsletters or something.  Maybe I&#x27;m 
just hoping too much ;)  
But this goes for everyone, if your not just souly focussed on 
speedcubing Cubism for Fun is definately a magazine to check out!

was planning to come on Thursday, and set up the exhibit on Friday, 
but as I haven&#x27;t booked my flight yet, I am flexible. Please tell me 
what I should do, if I may do that. Please give me some time frame. 
The designs I plan to exhibt are Vasarely, Landry Staircase and 
Design for Pedestrians. They are all in http://cube.misto.cz .

I hope this site is functional. Recently there was some sort of a 
server error, and the site did not display what it is supposed to 
display. It was working correctrly last time I looked. If worse comes 
to worse, you cn always show then the scanned photos  sent you. I 
hope you still have them.

          <div class="email-content">I both agree and disagree with your friend.  I think that the more 
you break in your cube (twisting etc.) then the more the inside will 
wear down and the more you will be able to cut corners, which is a 
major boon when going fast (at least I try to take advantage of it as 
much as possible).  Since wearing in a cube and wearing down the hard 
edges builds up cube dust inside, I guess it could appear that the 
dust itself is lubing the cube, but I think it is just the fact that 
the dust has come off the pieces that helps.  I used to think that 
the dust in the cube was the best lube, however the first time I 
applied some silicone based lubricant to my cube I changed my mind 
completely :)

My two cents,
Chris

Yes, cube-lovers appears to be alive again, just on a different server!<br>
I suppose that all of our subscriptions were lost when the old one shut<br>
down.<br>

But what would probably work best is if all speed cubing related<br>

there.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, guys, you are finally doing, what I always asaked you to do - 
providing me with resources on cube art on the web. However, I know 
this page also. It shows another 2d cube artist, who, alas, is now 
deceased. I think he is one of the first to have the idea to create  
multi-cube art, and from the website I suspect he was about ready to 
switch freom 2d to 3d. The end came too soon for him. :-(  His name 
was Fred Holly.

And that&#x27;s it. As far as I know, Jacob Davenport, Fred Holly and I 
are the only multi-cube artists I could find. So  the next site has 
to point to someone I don&#x27;t know., Keep trying. :-)

Please, by all means visit this page. Interesting pieces.

Amd let us not make the mistske of excluding the speedcubists, just 
because they have their Yahoo group. In fact, everyone who loves the 
cube should belong to cube-lovers.

On Rubiks.com you can get replacement stickers that are already the 
right shape. But you should measure the litte cubes on the cube, 
andthen cut the stickers to that size. I think it&#x27;s 1.6 cm. 
Unfortunately for Americans, we&#x27;re kinda dumb, so I don&#x27;t know to to 
use the metric system. Maybe you do.

          <div class="email-content">I have recently bought the &quot;Memory Pack&quot; by Andi Bell (I wanted to <br>
try a different approach to that implememted by Harry Lorayne).<br>
<br>
I am sure that this topic has come up before but cannot find any <br>
references when searching the archives, but he uses a rubiks cube to <br>
represent the number 56, with the intriguing comment &#x27;If you think <br>
about it, it has 56 squares&#x27;.<br>
<br>
There are 9 squares on each of the 6 facef which adds up to 54, so <br>
my question is how can you think that there are 56 squares?<br>
<br>
The only 2 possibilities I can come up with are:<br>
<br>
a) he made a mistake thinking 9 times 6 is 56, or<br>
b) his cube had two extra squares on it (eg on a logo on the centre <br>
piece of the white face), though I haven&#x27;t seen a cube that does.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Jake, let&#x27;s all be friends!  :)

Here are some more thoughts...

Let&#x27;s keep the existing name. This group has a life of it&#x27;s own and I 
doubt a name change would have too much impact on how it evolves 
anyway.

I&#x27;m certainly happy to see people initiate conversations on any cube 
related topic, not just speedcubing. However, when replying to 
someone else&#x27;s topic, surely the reply should_be_a_reply? Isn&#x27;t the 
reason you hit the &#x27;reply&#x27; button because you want to engage in 
discussion on that issue? If you want to talk about something 
different, then perhaps you should start a new conversation string. 
Replying to a topic, and then cutting the conversation off and 
changing it to something unrelated to what everyone was discussing 
will frustrate people.

I thought of an example to illustrate one of the points Jake was 
making (at least I think this is what you were getting at Jake, sorry 
if I misunderstoof)...
Imagine someone saw a funny Rubik&#x27;s cube t-shirt in a shop and wanted 
to tell everyone (&quot;hey guys, guess what I saw when I was shopping 
today??&quot;). I don&#x27;t think there would be a problem creating a new 
conversation string and saying this. It&#x27;s a different situation, 
however, if someone replied to an existing conversation where people 
were discussing group theory and said &quot;yeah, well, that maths stuff 
can be interesting if you&#x27;re into it, but I found this cool t-shirt 
and so let&#x27;s all talk about that now&quot; (not that anyone would say that 
exactly, but you get the idea). In the first example, it&#x27;s likely to 
lead to a string of replies from others who have seen fun cube 
merchandise around (ie. a positive outcome!). In the second example, 
however, people will just get annoyed (definitely not a positive 
outcome!).

So, I think the issue isn&#x27;t so much the idea of talking about cube 
topics that aren&#x27;t strictly speedcubing, it&#x27;s more how you go about 
raising the topic, and not cutting off existing conversations.

What do people think?

Unfortunately, unless you live in, or have friends in Toronto, you 
need a place to sleep and food to eat. That costs money, which some 
of hose college kids just don&#x27;t have. 
Let us not forget transportation. I think the original poster is from 
the US. But that could be Hawaii, Alaska, Florida or Texas. Pretty 
far from Toronto, as the map will tell you.

          <div class="email-content">Do you have a job? If not, then you probably need to save your money. 
I&#x27;m going to assume you do, though.

I got lucky, though, because my dad goes on so many business trips 
that he has roughly 5.7 billion frequent flier miles. So we got the 
plane tickets for just about nothing. But doesn&#x27;t the hotel have a 
special Rubiks cuber rate for people participating?

Since this topic is about people going/not going, I&#x27;m going to share 
something I find very annoying: I taught three of my friends how to 
solve the cube. They can each solve in about 45 seconds, and they 
enjoy it greatly. At first all three of them were going, then one 
dropped out for no reason. Another one lost interest, so he&#x27;s not 
going either. Then the last friend, and the one that&#x27;s best at the 
cube (besides me) decided not to go for no reason at all either. He 
says that he thinks it will be boring. He figures that we&#x27;ll go to 
Toronto, go to the cube for time, then leave. Now I&#x27;m all alone....

I&#x27;ve seen some people, like Lars Petrus and Gille(sp?) have a watch 
that they time themselves on screen with. And I think some computer 
movie editor things can let you put a timer on it. I don&#x27;t know of 
any other way, though.

          <div class="email-content">The best place to buy a silicone spray lubricant is your local <br>
hardware store.<br>
<br>
I just got some today, and WOW what a difference! It really is great.<br>
<br>
Most people take it apart and spray each side, but the spray I got <br>
today came with a thin red plastic tube that you can attach to the <br>
spray-head, so my dad just attached that and gave it about a .5 <br>
second spray between each cubie.<br>
<br>
That worked perfectly. So if you don&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of <br>
taking your cube apart, just buy a spray that comes with a little <br>
tube that you can attach to the spray-head.<br>
<br>
Make SURE the spray you buy is silicone-based. If it&#x27;s not silicone-<br>
based, you&#x27;ll have a lot of problems with it... at first I tried some <br>
WD-40, that&#x27;s a petroleum-based lubricant, and it completely <br>
destroyed my second Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<br>

I just take out an edge piece, and spray a little silicone inside, 
put the edge back in, and mix up the cube....do this 2 or 3 times.  
Then you need to let it set and dry for about 20 mins.

Hi!

Why don&#x27;t you assemble your cube and practice, instead of cleaning/ 
drying/lubing/watching it and posting messages?

Seriously beginners use to worry TOO MUCH about their cubes, but the 
cube is not so important (especially for beginners).

You shouldn&#x27;t wash it. If it become slippery on the outside at all, 
then you might have used too much so just wipe it with a towel.
After all, why would you wash the lubrication off when you just lubed 
it?

          <div class="email-content">Hi !<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m about to improve the method I currently use and I&#x27;m looking for <br>
interresting new approaches...<br>
<br>
I do 44 sec AVG with a lucky PB of 33 sec.<br>
I use a light friedrich system with a LL in 4 looks.<br>
I average 23 in the F2L.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of starting to do the Last layer before the first two <br>
are completely done.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s call it an extended LL, where instead of doing all the LL in 2 <br>
looks you do the last F2L pair and the LL in 3 looks.<br>
<br>
Based on this there is several possible approaches including your <br>
own, that is  : <br>
<br>
last f2l edge + orient edges, last f2l corner + permute edges, orient <br>
and permute corners.<br>
<br>
I thought that if we could find a chronology that let us end with <br>
only the permutations, it would be easier to switch techniques from <br>
friedrich&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
for example : <br>
<br>
last f2l edge + orient edges, last f2l corner + orient corners, <br>
permute all.<br>
<br>
it just spreads the orientation phase on the last pair...<br>
the problem with this one is the huge ammount of algs when the 5 <br>
corners are to be moved altogether...<br>
<br>
And we can&#x27;t touch the LL edges before the last f2l edge is in <br>
place...<br>
or can we ?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure there is a way...but I still don&#x27;t see it...<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about someone able to do the Hardwick&#x27;s extended cross, then 2 <br>
F2L pairs, then finish in 3 looks...it would be pretty fast !!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Oh. You shouldn&#x27;t wash it anyway. Sometimes dust collects in the 
cube, and that helps it turn better. So don&#x27;t wash it out.
As for the stickers, I personally like vinyl tape so I don&#x27;t know why 
it isn&#x27;t working for you. Some people paint their cube, and that 
wokrs quite well.

          <div class="email-content">Well, I would suggest an exacto knife or something. I&#x27;ve never done 
it before, though, so I can&#x27;t say.
But on rubiks.com, they have sticker replacement kits for $4.99. 
They come with enough stickers for three cubes, and since it will 
take several years for the stickers to wear out (I think), those 
will hold forever. Those stickers are already in the right shape. 
Here&#x27;s the link: http://www.rubikshop.com/cgi-
bin/shop.cgi/SID=1058140009.3466.r/num=stkcls

Also, I&#x27;m working on a new way to resticker cubes that doesn&#x27;t 
actually have anything to do with stickers. It has to do with super 
gluing colored index cards on to the cube. It should (hopefully) 
work well.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t particularly agree with this suggestion. I go through 
stickers like crazy and order them buy the hundreds. Those crappy 
rubiks.com ones are not worth the money, they will peel and lose 
pigmentation after 3 weeks of use. I recommend vinyl/electrical tape 
and a good pair of sissors. I call dibs on the signature deep fillet 
I&#x27;ve been using for the last 3 years :). I&#x27;m currently trying to 
work out a deal to obtain a bulk supply of cube stickers (with the 
good orange), I might run a service (little/no profit) similar to 
Ton&#x27;s studio cubes to help remidy this problem we face in this 
community.

&gt; it just spreads the orientation phase on the last pair...<br>
&gt; the problem with this one is the huge ammount of algs when the 5 <br>
&gt; corners are to be moved altogether...<br>
<br>
14 orientation patterns * 5 corner positions = up to 70 algorithms.<br>
<br>
Also, corners are quite difficult to manipulate. You might find the<br>
algorithms are longer and more difficult to work out. <br>
<br>
I decided to permute edges instead, for a number of reasons:<br>
<br>
1. The edge permutation is easy to recognise because the edges are<br>
   oriented.<br>
2. There are only 3 unique edge permutations because the F2L edge is in<br>
   place.<br>
3. Edges are easier to manipulate.<br>
<br>
Also, many of the algorithms are obvious and easy to work out:<br>
<br>
http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step3.html<br>
<br>
Half of the algorithms require only 7 moves, and you probably know many<br>
of them from the Fridrich system. It is just a matter of knowing how<br>
they affect the edges.<br>
<br>
For step 4, you can if you wish split it into two stages, orienting<br>
corners (6 algs) then permuting (3 algs). 4 of the 6 orientation algs<br>
can be taken directly from Jessica&#x27;s orientation algorithms (the ones<br>
that preserve the edges). And all 3 permutation algorithms can be taken<br>
from her list.<br>

it&#x27;s already been done? My colored note card idea, is wokring well so 
far, but on Gille&#x27;s site there is something basically the same. Only 
he uses plastic dividers instead. You might want to check his site 
instead of vinyl tape anyway, as it sounds like a really good idea.

Centre close enough to walk..

they are both 5 minutes away..The Crown Plaza to the east and The 
Holiday Inn to the West..

The Crown is much nicer and cheaper along with the simple fact that 
there will be a gathering before and a party after...

your ultimate choice in the end...

And could you please elaborate on the TV appearances post you made a 
few days ago.

How many people are actually driving to Toronto from the US through 
Michigan and wish to car pool?

          <div class="email-content">If your coming early and your from the US, everything is cheap 
here....pick a place...

my recommendation would be at the venue hotel for 10 bucks more..

or if you want el cheapo motel, i could arrange that also...but 
please remember that your on your own once you get here, so be safe!

as to TV appearances, the PR company has requested a list of people 
showing up early as media outlets will be wanting interviews(live) 
during the week before the event..

Thus far the TV stations here locally want to do the underwater on a 
week day at a local pool..

thus the reason for asking who is showing up when......

          <div class="email-content">Dan, I sent you an email privately. I hope you got it. Please respond.
Some questions there you already answered here:
1. How far is it from venue to  hotel? Answer: 5 minutes&#x27; walk
2. About TV company: will be here a week prior to the event.
Further question Should they be interested in cube art,I will need to 
come earlier and et up the designs. I would like some time frame.
Other questions are in the wmail I sent.
Thank you,

          <div class="email-content">I was also looking for hotels, and before I found the Crown Plaza I 
found one called Inn on the Lake (or something like that). Is that 
one any good?
I&#x27;m staying at the Crown Plaza, but I just wanted to see if you know 
about this one.

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
Mike Reid&#x27;s optimal solver does that:<br>
<br>
http://hedgehog.math.arizona.edu/~reid/Rubik/optimal_solver.html<br>
<br>
By default it is configured for the quarter-turn metric.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m also arriving early afternoon on the Thursday, flying in from the 
UK, it would be great to meet up and have a nose around the city, and 
do the touristy thing. I&#x27;ll be staying at Crowne Plaza the whole time 
I&#x27;m there, so perhaps we could sort something out.

Cheers

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Does anybody know about an optimal solver that finds otpimal <br>
&gt; solutions in terms of quarter-turns?<br>
<br>
I have an optimal solver that finds solutions in either the quarter<br>
turn metric or the half turn metric.  I&#x27;m currently running it on<br>
random cubes (I&#x27;m up to 7000 cubes) but I&#x27;d be delighted to &quot;optimize&quot;<br>
any patterns that people here have.<br>
<br>
Input is a move sequence (of course, possibly non-optimal).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d be happy to make source available too, but it requires 700MB of<br>
RAM to run.  On an old Celeron 1.3GHz machine, it takes an average of<br>
about 15 minutes to solve a half-turn position and 6 minutes to solve<br>
a quarter turn position.  (The median is quite a bit less than this.)<br>
<br>
It takes advantage of symmetry too so it works well for &quot;pretty<br>
patterns&quot;.<br>
<br>
So just post the move sequences you&#x27;d like to optimize (or email them<br>
to me) and I&#x27;ll send back the result.<br>

   Will there be anything in the vicinity of Toronto related to
viewing Mars? Its closest approach in a very long time is that weekend.

<br>
But there is SUCH a difference between knowing the alg, and really KNOWING the alg, in the first case, you would see the case, and think, righttt, what do I do here... and then perform the algorithm. But in the second case, you would see the case, and not even thinking about it your hands would instantly apply the algorithms. This way, even if you have not seen the case for weeks, as soon as you see it, your hands would automatically start the algorithm off. This I&#x27;m afraid, only comes with lots and lots of practice.<br>

you memorize them well, there is very little chance of you forgetting 
them, except for the occasional bout of amnesia :)

I say go for learning the LL algs if you&#x27;re interested.  However, you 
may want to wait until after the championships to really dive into 
that area, so that you won&#x27;t confuse yourself when you&#x27;re on stage.

So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll start working on it yet.
Or maybe I&#x27;ll start wokring on it, but just not /use/ it yet. Hmm....

&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t you forget the ones that you barely ever do?<br>
<br>
What I do is practice the algorithms in groups. In your case, you can<br>
divide up your groups according to the orientation pattern of the edges,<br>
with each edge pattern representing a different group. Within each<br>
group, there will be many different patterns of corners, and in one day,<br>
you can practice one such group. The way to practice is to just do a<br>
normal speed cubing session, and when you get to the final layer, adjust<br>
the orientation of the edges to match the pattern your practicing<br>
(usually a 6 move algorithm is enough to do the trick). You should still<br>
end up in a random corner pattern, but you have just narrowed the<br>
possibilities. This way, you can make some of the rare cases occur more<br>
frequently while you&#x27;re practicing.<br>
<br>
As for remembering algorithms, some algorithms are very easy to<br>
remember, while some are very difficult. I pick the ones that are very<br>
easy to remember.<br>
<br>
For example, in my last layer approach, there are a few basic algorithms<br>
that are very short, and it turns out that it is possible to solve most<br>
positions using a combination of these short algorithms. When they are<br>
combined together, a few moves in the middle cancel out giving an<br>
optimal solution, but an easy to remember one. Maybe this is possible in<br>
the Fridrich system too.<br>
<br>
&gt; See, I&#x27;m trying to figure out a different way to do the method I&#x27;m <br>
&gt; using (petrus). During the F2L, the edges get oriented. Then for the <br>
&gt; last layer, I use two sequences. But if I didn&#x27;t orient the edges <br>
&gt; during the first two layers, and I learned the LL orientation algs, <br>
&gt; it would be the same amount of time minus the edge orientation.<br>
<br>
Not exactly, the F2L can be finished more quickly if the edges are<br>
already oriented (single hand grip), and so can the last layer (most of<br>
the shortest orientation algorithms are when all of the edges are<br>
oriented). So maybe it all evens out...<br>

I noticed that around half the posts to this group recently have been <br>
about WC details.  There is actually another group, &quot;wc2003&quot;, that <br>
was set up specifically to keep these sorts of topics out of the <br>
regular speedcubing group.  That way people who aren&#x27;t going to <br>
Toronto don&#x27;t have to read all those posts, and even people who are <br>
have a better way of separating emails about speedcubing technique, <br>
and logistical topics related to the championships (lodging, <br>
transportation, etc.).  I myself subscribe to both groups so I&#x27;m <br>
going to get all the posts anyway, but we should be mindful of the <br>
people who aren&#x27;t going to Toronto (and the people who went to the <br>
trouble of setting up the wc2003 group) when making our posts.<br>

I agree, it is not very  onsiderate to those who set up the WC2003 
group,  but such is human nature.

          <div class="email-content">Dan, trhe time flies by. Today is July 16. Wehave 15+23=38 days. In 
that time the cubes should be set up and ready for viewing. I am 
worried about Canadian customs. Those gentlemen don&#x27;t know trhat 
there is a Championship going on in Toronto and the cubes are shipped 
for an exhibit. When confronted with not one, but 252 Rubik&#x27;s cubs, 
they might think the world has gone crazy. That&#x27;s why I would kike to 
send them out sooner.

The post office here told me the maximum weight and box duimensions 
it will accept. When I figured it all out, I found all those cubes 
WILL STILL BE UNDER THOSE LIMITS. Isn&#x27;t that cool? I may send the box 
via the Post Office.
Thank you,

PS. Who is Dave C?

Canada Customs has been alerted about our event.

Dave C is one of the licensee&#x27;s here in Canada and he is also a major 
sponsor.

His office location will be used to deliver all the gear for the 
event which now includes your cubes...

if you have my work email please send me a quicky so we can get you 
the address today for shipment...

<br>
Speedstack timer pads will be used for our event to introduce total <br>
fairness during starts and stops.<br>
<br>
All competitors will be assigned time to get use to the pads upon <br>
arrival to the event hotel.<br>
<br>
Whats new on these pads which introduce total fairness you ask?<br>
<br>
there are hand pads where your hands have to be place on the pad to <br>
ready the timer...timer starts when hands are removed from pad and <br>
stops when hands are place back on the pad....<br>
<br>
We are aware of possible fallout from this however in order to make <br>
things totally fair the RCC(rubisk championship committee) has <br>
decided to implement this type of timer.<br>
<br>
Each event podium will have one of these timers as well as 2 <br>
officials with stop watches as backups to the timer. in case of timer <br>
failure the lowest time on the backup stop watch will be the time for <br>
said run....<br>
<br>
These pads in the future will be modified with the Rubiks logo etc <br>
and will be implemented onto the rubiks site for purchase and will be <br>
used for all future events...<br>

          <div class="email-content">The fewest moves event will run as follows:

1 scramble will be identified.

person who produces the lowest move count wins...

if you start on saturday you have until end of saturday to provide 
the finish result in writing as well as demonstrating...

you are not permitted to leave the podium area&#x27;s or consult with any 
third party device or person during your time. Brain only.

same thing applies to Sunday...

therefore you have basically 8 hours each day and i will permit 
attempts from both days...

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
I suspect alot of people aren&#x27;t telling how fast they really are now <br>
near to the WC. But I think that it doesn&#x27;t matter for me. When we <br>
will be on stage in the WC it won&#x27;t matter what record we have. I <br>
think that most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower than their <br>
best avg. So that&#x27;s why I post this. Don&#x27;t think I will repeat this <br>
in the WC...<br>
<br>
Today I broke the unofficial world record. I haven&#x27;t cubed much <br>
lately and I thought that I should practise some so I wouldn&#x27;t be <br>
slower. So I made a few averages. At first my avg was something like <br>
18.2 or so. But in an hour my times were much better. Here are my <br>
times:<br>
<br>
15.74 17.83 17.53 14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7 14.83 14.83 <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey David, 
congrats on breaking (your!) UWR again, the times were good.
Talking with a friend or so helps to keep relaxed and achieve 
good/consistent times.

I suppose your thought about WC ic completely true. Anyway I think 
the same.

bye and congratulations again.

          <div class="email-content">It was pretty easy to learn the permutation algs, but that&#x27;s because 
there are only 21 of them.
I usually try to learn 2 algs per day, except when I have loads of 
free time when I do 3-5. So it would take  about a month to learn 
alll of the OLL algs, but then it would take about 2 or 3 more months 
to get really used to them and be able to use them instantly when I 
see the proper pattern.

Did you include inserting the last edge on the first layer? There are 7<br>
positions the edge can be in, either flipped or unflipped. Here are the<br>
move counts to insert (and possibly orient) the edge from different<br>
positions:<br>
<br>
When it&#x27;s badly oriented: 5 4 4 4 3 3 4<br>
When it&#x27;s correctly oriented: 0 1 1 1 2 2 2<br>
<br>
You seem to suggest that the orientation step does not contribute to the<br>
solution and it only wastes moves. I found in my system that wherever I<br>
do the orientation step, it always makes the following steps easier, so<br>
I don&#x27;t consider it a waste of moves. In fact it seems to all even out<br>
in the end, wherever I do the orientation.<br>
<br>
It may be that you find it easier to do it one way than the other. It&#x27;s<br>
all a matter of personal preference, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean one<br>
way is better than the other.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think that the edge orientation step is necessarily a waste 
of time, I just feel that is is not entirely needed. Right now, I&#x27;m 
averaging 65 moves. I do about 2.5 to 2.75 moves per second, which 
results in times of 25+ seconds, so without the edge orientation step 
(which I just think I&#x27;m bad at, for some reason) I can get my moves 
down to at most 60 moves. That will be about 22 to 25 seconds. 
Hopefully. And if it doesn&#x27;t work out to lowering my times, then I 
doubt that it will raise my times at all.

What I said about corner permutations applies specifically to last layer<br>
corner permutations which involve only 4 corners. If you do any U/R<br>

Subject: I broke the UWR

Hi!
I suspect alot of people aren&#x27;t telling how fast they really are now
near to the WC. But I think that it doesn&#x27;t matter for me. When we
will be on stage in the WC it won&#x27;t matter what record we have. I
think that most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower than their
best avg. So that&#x27;s why I post this. Don&#x27;t think I will repeat this
in the WC...

Today I broke the unofficial world record. I haven&#x27;t cubed much
lately and I thought that I should practise some so I wouldn&#x27;t be
slower. So I made a few averages. At first my avg was something like
18.2 or so. But in an hour my times were much better. Here are my
times:

15.74 17.83 17.53 14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7 14.83 14.83
(18.83) = 16.31

Four times below 15 seconds and no one above 19! That has never
happened before. Non of the solves was lucky btw.

The strange thing was that I during this session talked  with a
friend in the phone. I may not have been a very active speaker, but
I answered questions and saying &quot;yes &quot; or &quot;no&quot; while I was solving
the cube. This may have had the effect that I wasn&#x27;t &quot;thinking&quot; so
much, and instead my brain took care of the rest. I couldn&#x27;t
understand that it went so fast but it did. Someone else who have
similar experiences?

therefore you have basically 8 hours each day and i will permit

   this is Mirek.
   You&#x27;ve got the point. I&#x27;ve solved cube in less than 30 moves 
several times recently. It usually takes me couple of hours and the 
overall time depends on my concentration, mind condition and luck. I 
am observing that the time for solution is shrinking with my 
experience, however. I looked into one challenge from Fewest Moves 
Challenges that had an old winner Guus Razoux with 27 moves solution 
(see FMC Results for 04/07/03) and I found my 24 moves solution in 
about 1 hour (between midnight and 1am).  
Scrambling Algorithm: R B L F (D&#x27; R)x6 (L B)x6 (U&#x27; F&#x27;)x6
Solution: D2 L2 F D2 F&#x27; D B2 L&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; U&#x27; L U B L 
B&#x27; L2
Sure, I may struggle with other challenges for 4 hours to get under 
30 moves.
My solution for this week challenge took me little bit more. If I 
have measured the time it would have been about 2 to 3 hours. I am 
not revealing the number of moves now, you&#x27;ll see on Friday. ;-)

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/3153

It seems other speedcubists are not that interested in this aspect of 
defining records, which I find a bit a bit strange because it seems so 
crucial.  Records need a definite start and a definite finish, and starting 
and finishing with the cube in your hands will make those two &quot;instants&quot; 
almost impossible to identify.

I think the speedstack timers will probably work quite well but serious 
contenders had better start practicing!   I could be wrong, but it seems to 
me that using the speedstack timers results in something fairly similar to 
what I proposed.

          <div class="email-content">Fair comment, Adam. However...

I joined the the wc2003 group ages ago when it started, and was 
checking it regularly (not as often as this group). Then one day, my 
access suddenly disappeared. I couldn&#x27;t get into it anymore. I never 
bothered trying to find out what happened though, because this group 
was so active that (sometimes) I had trouble keeping up with all the 
posts here.

Don&#x27;t know if this happened to anyone else, but if so, it might 
partially explain why people post stuff here instead of there?? 
Having said this, I suspect the main reason people post RWC stuff 
here because this is (at least I think it is?) the most active cube 
group, and probably the one that more people join and check. Probably 
most people would automatically post their cube topics here, 
regardless of whether there&#x27;s a specific sub-group (eg. RWC, blind-
folded cubing).

but not to worry, wc2003 is not used much and there is only 5 weeks 
left at which time it will be shut down and reopened 
as &quot;cornersfirstcubing&quot;

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I guess this explains it then.

I guess this means that some people would have to post RWC questions 
here then. There are probably people who aren&#x27;t going, but are still 
interested to ask about things. Also, from previous posts I gather 
that there are people who are interested to go but are still weighing 
up the financial side of things before committing. I guess these 
people would also have to post their RWC questions here?

          <div class="email-content">>From Mirek:
Some of you noticed that the solution I gave in my previous posting 
was incorrect. This is because I rotated the cube before solving. The 
following move is correct (hopefully :-)):

B2 D2 R B2 R&#x27; B L2 D&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; D F L D L&#x27; D2 (24) 

A short explanation:
B2 D2 R B2 R&#x27; B L2 D&#x27; F2 B&#x27; L&#x27; . B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; D F L D L&#x27; D2 + 3-cycle 
of corners inserted after the dot as 
  L F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B

          <div class="email-content">so i&#x27;ve known how to solve the rubik&#x27;s cube for maybe 8 months or so <br>
now.  i&#x27;ve never done any speedcubing stuff, i just know the long <br>

have a special cube or anything, just whatever kind they were <br>
selling at KB toys.  no special lubes or anything.<br>
<br>
i can usually do the cube in under 3 minutes, but i&#x27;d like to get <br>
faster.  memorizing all of those algorithms seems a bit more then im <br>
willing to take on right now, but i do have some questions that i <br>
think might help me out.<br>
<br>
one part that slows me down a lot is getting the first face.  <br>
usually i solve for one color, and then swap some of the cubies <br>
around (take one out, then put it back in where it needs to go)...  <br>
obviously the slow way of going about things.  i&#x27;ve heard most <br>
speedcubers get the initial &#x27;cross&#x27; in about 7 moves...  but i dont <br>
see how to do that.  does anyone have any tips for me?  i dont know <br>
how to do it besides doing it one edge at a time, which would <br>
obviously take more than 7 moves.<br>
<br>
any helpful hints for the first face, or any part of the cube <br>
really...  anything that i can do without having to memorize 40 <br>
algorithms...  would be greatly appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">There are a few methods that require very few algorithms to be 
memorized. Lars Petrus&#x27; is the best, in my humble opinion. 
www.lar5.com/cube
There is also a corners first method that requires very few algs. But 
to get fast, you will eventually need to learn at least 10, 
preferably more.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; one part that slows me down a lot is getting the first face.  <br>
&gt; usually i solve for one color, and then swap some of the cubies <br>
&gt; around (take one out, then put it back in where it needs to go)...  <br>
&gt; obviously the slow way of going about things.<br>
<br>
Yes, for the first layer, instead of just solving for one color only <br>
and replacing cubies until it is all solved, at first you might want <br>
to try using the standard cross (solving the edges). At this point in <br>
your cubing, don&#x27;t even worry about using minimizing moves (for the <br>
cross), that number will go down the more you solve it. Also, for the <br>
cross part of your solution, take 10-15 seconds and examine the cube <br>
to try and plan out at least two edges of the cross, that will help <br>
your time as well.<br>
<br>
I would also recommend solving your cross on the bottom (or left) <br>
because you can see another face (as opposed to solving it on the <br>
top) and therefore more edges, leading to reduced time and moves for <br>
that part. If you are still solving the cross on the top, I suggest <br>
you adjust your method immediatly.<br>
<br>
Another benefit of solving the cross on the bottom, is the finger <br>
shorcuts associated with solving the corners (or corner-edge pairs). <br>
Just position the corner above (cross on bottom) the correct <br>
position, and do a three move finger shortcut (R U R&#x27; or L&#x27; U&#x27; L) to <br>
place the corner in the right spot.<br>
<br>
This will allow you to solve the first layer in 10 or 15 seconds once <br>
you get the hang of the shortcuts (you need some silicone spray, <br>
check out Dan Knight&#x27;s page for instructions on creating a good, <br>
fast, loose cube).<br>
<br>
Once you have the first layer (with no algorithms mind you), you can <br>
solve the second layer using only one algorithm (and its inverse). <br>
With the first layer on bottom, just position the edge piece you want <br>
to solve (learn to avoid &quot;seeing&quot; edge pieces that have your last <br>
layer color in them) so that whatever color is not in the top layer <br>
lines up correctly with the center piece and do one of the following:<br>
<br>
(U&#x27; L&#x27;) (U L&#x27; U) (R&#x27; U&#x27; R): places edge lined up with right face.<br>
or<br>
(U R) (U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;) (F&#x27; U F): places edge lined up with front face.<br>
<br>
For a better visual understanding of these algorithms/situations, <br>
check out the second and third algorithms (I think) on <br>
speedcubing.com&#x27;s F2L algorithm section.<br>
<br>
For the last layer, just use (and speed up, &quot;triggerize&quot;) the moves <br>
you already know.<br>
<br>
Using this method I averaged 40 seconds (that&#x27;s the much improved <br>
second layer algorithms I listed, much better/shorter than the ones <br>
listed in the Rubik&#x27;s hint book that comes with the cube, and I used <br>
the last four algs in the book: 2-corner swap, 3-corner shuffle, and <br>
right/left edge flip).<br>
<br>
Once you get this down and under a minte, I recommend learning Dan <br>
Knight&#x27;s intermediate last layer solution (about 9 algorithms), then <br>
his Advanced (about 20), the you will be ready for the expert (2 look <br>
LL solution, 13/21 + 40/57 algorithms!).<br>
<br>
If you are unfamiliar or unclear about anything, you can post here to <br>
ask for clarification or email me.<br>
<br>
Basically the beginning of &quot;the speed&quot; starts with a well lubed cube, <br>
lots of research and reading, determination, and practice!<br>
<br>
Good luck and I hope this was somewhat helpful while longwinded.<br>

one depicted at<br>
<br>
http://www.chrisloanshome.8m.com/Rubics_Cube/cube_complete.htm<br>
<br>
...im not sure what it&#x27;s called.  i looked at the lars method <br>
earlier today, but it seems really different from what im already <br>
doing, i think id rather stick to the method i already use, modified <br>
a bit of course.  thanks for your help tho =]<br>
<br>
<br>
in response to nathan...  these hints seem like they should help <br>
me!  i think i&#x27;ll have to give them a lot of practice though.  i <br>
usually work with the first layer on top (i dont do the &#x27;cross&#x27; yet) <br>
until i solve the first two layers, then flip it over and have the <br>
bottom on top.  i can see the benefit of adjusting it so the cross <br>
is on the left or bottom, but it will take some getting used to, <br>
since my finger already know the algorithm with the cross on top, so <br>
i dont have to think about it too much.  ill get the hang of it <br>
though.<br>
<br>
sometimes when solving the cube i have a piece that should be in my <br>
top layer on bottom, and i have to mess up some of the top pieces to <br>
get the bottom one in place...  if that makes sense.  the same <br>
problem occurs when i have the piece i want in the &#x27;top&#x27; row (so <br>
that the cubie is permuted incorrectly).  are there any helpful <br>
algorithms for these?  or am i just looking at this from the wrong <br>
perspective?<br>
<br>
and you have the three finger shortcuts for getting all of the <br>
corners in the right place...  these seem helpful, but what <br>
algorithms do you use to permute the corner to make sure the colors <br>
are facing the right direction?<br>
<br>
also, the notation you mentioned (U R&#x27; F, etc) is always in relation <br>
to how you hold the cube, correct?  or is it standard no matter how <br>
you hold the cube?<br>

&gt; since my finger already know the algorithm with the cross on top, so<br>

&gt; though.<br>
<br>
I remember when I used to solve the cross, I used have &#x27;algorithms&#x27; <br>
as well. However, try not to think of/use algorithms to solve the <br>
cross. Try to do it intuitively. Just pick one edge at at time, line <br>
it up with the appropriate middle/center cubie, and rotate that face <br>
to the bottom...over and over and over and over and done.<br>
<br>
&gt; sometimes when solving the cube i have a piece that should be in my <br>
&gt; top layer on bottom, and i have to mess up some of the top pieces <br>
to <br>
&gt; get the bottom one in place...  if that makes sense.<br>
<br>
The only way I can see that happening is if you are not solving the <br>
cross &#x27;correctly&#x27; (All four edge pieces lining up correctly with the <br>
middle/center cubie) or completely (all four edges solved = cross). <br>
Because once you have the cross, you don&#x27;t have to remove/move any <br>
edge pieces to finish up the remaining first layer corners. Just <br>
double check to see if your cross is complete/correct.<br>
<br>
&gt; the same <br>
problem occurs when i have the piece i want in the &#x27;top&#x27; row (so <br>
&gt; that the cubie is permuted incorrectly).  are there any helpful <br>
&gt; algorithms for these?  or am i just looking at this from the wrong <br>
&gt; perspective?<br>
<br>
I am not sure about this problem, could you clarify it a little bit <br>
more?<br>
<br>
&gt; and you have the three finger shortcuts for getting all of the <br>
&gt; corners in the right place...  these seem helpful, but what <br>
&gt; algorithms do you use to permute the corner to make sure the colors <br>
&gt; are facing the right direction?<br>
<br>
Once again, they aren&#x27;t really algorithms, just maniuplating the <br>
first layer corner pieces into positions. Once again, try to &quot;not <br>
see&quot; the corners for the last layer, only the first (ie: my bottom <br>
layer is white, and I only look (&quot;see&quot;) white corner pieces. The key <br>
to positioning them and setting them up for the quick triggers I <br>
mentioned...is simply getting them in the top layer (cross on bottom) <br>
and having your bottom layer color facing either left or right. <br>
(Assume you use white for the cross from now on, and you have yellow <br>
opposite, for easier explanations) Once you have a white corner piece <br>
in the top layer and it is facing left or right (the white side of <br>
the cubie), simply rotate the <br>
top layer until that corner piece is directly above where it goes. <br>
Still assuming the white is facing left or right on the top layer, <br>
you will know that it is in the correct position because the color to <br>
the right/left of the white (on the same corner cube) will match the <br>
center/middle cubie. Then it is in the correct location, and do one <br>
of those triggers. Do it slowly and watch how it places the corner.<br>
<br>
If you have corners with white facing up (as opposed to left/right) <br>
in the top layer, just move the top layer so that that corner cubie <br>
is over an unsolved (empty) corner. Now you can do a quick move (you <br>
will eventually triggerize it) to fix it (make the white face left or <br>
right). You can do one of the following (with a corner where white is <br>
facing up and above an empty/unsolved corner:<br>
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27;  or  L&#x27; U2 L U<br>
They both do exactly the same thing. But do them slowly at first and <br>
watch how thow four moves positions it correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; also, the notation you mentioned (U R&#x27; F, etc) is always in <br>
relation <br>
&gt; to how you hold the cube, correct?  or is it standard no matter how <br>
&gt; you hold the cube?<br>
<br>
Yes, the &quot;standard&quot; notation always refers to your current <br>
orientation (how you are currently holding the cube). <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  I just wanted to make a quick post about a revelation <br>
of sorts that I have had recently.  For anyone that is interested in <br>
speed solving, I want to take the time to emphasize exactly how <br>
utterly and completely important the quality of your cube is to your <br>
skill as a speed cubist.  I have recently made some pretty big <br>
improvements, after a very very very long stretch of static times, <br>
and I now know why.  Anyway for those of you who don&#x27;t know, I had <br>
been stuck with a personal best average of 22.0 seconds for about 2 <br>
years straight.  This was on a worn out cube that I had been using <br>
since I first started cubing (1998).  Anyway I was able to improve <br>
down to the high 21&#x27;s on this cube but then I switched to a studio <br>
cube.  As I am continually breaking in this studio cube my times have <br>
gotten consistently better.  What made me want to send this post is <br>
that I lubed my cube last night, then all of a sudden I set a new <br>
personal best average today.  Compared to my old junky beat up cube, <br>
my new cube after this last lubing/cleaning is AMAZING!  It is <br>
effortless to look ahead and go fast without having to worry about <br>
the alignment of the faces, not popping it because it is so loose, <br>
etc..  <br>
<br>
So anyway to make a long story short I was stuck in the low twenties <br>
for 2 years simply because I had a crappy cube.  Now that I have seen <br>
what a really good cube feels like I know what was holding me back.  <br>
So I just want to say that if any of you are like me and are cubing <br>
on a loose cube (the corners rattle when you shake it) and you&#x27;re <br>
stuck at a barrier, don&#x27;t do what I did!!!  Don&#x27;t keep using your old <br>
cube and getting frustrated that you&#x27;re not improving!  Chunk your <br>
old cube (well, save it for one handed cubing :-P) but get a new <br>
speed cube if you want to improve.  I have now realized that a good <br>
speed cubist not only has to have all the algorithms come to you like <br>
second nature, dextrous hands and all that, but SOOOO much of getting <br>
good times is having a good cube.<br>
<br>
So in short, don&#x27;t be like me.  Chunk your cube when it wears out for <br>
a better one if you want to improve.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll get off my soap box now,<br>

&gt; for 2 years simply because I had a crappy cube.  Now that I have <br>
seen <br>
&gt; what a really good cube feels like I know what was holding me <br>
back.  <br>
&gt; So I just want to say that if any of you are like me and are <br>
cubing <br>
&gt; on a loose cube (the corners rattle when you shake it) and you&#x27;re <br>
&gt; stuck at a barrier, don&#x27;t do what I did!!!  Don&#x27;t keep using your <br>
old <br>
&gt; cube and getting frustrated that you&#x27;re not improving!  Chunk your <br>
&gt; old cube (well, save it for one handed cubing :-P) but get a new <br>
&gt; speed cube if you want to improve.  I have now realized that a <br>
good <br>
&gt; speed cubist not only has to have all the algorithms come to you <br>
like <br>
&gt; second nature, dextrous hands and all that, but SOOOO much of <br>
getting <br>
&gt; good times is having a good cube.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So in short, don&#x27;t be like me.  Chunk your cube when it wears out <br>
for <br>
&gt; a better one if you want to improve.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ll get off my soap box now,<br>

<br>
&gt;i&#x27;ve heard most<br>
&gt;speedcubers get the initial &#x27;cross&#x27; in about 7 moves...  but i dont<br>
&gt;see how to do that.  does anyone have any tips for me?<br>
<br>
Hi Jeff: some good stuff has been posted already.  Here&#x27;s a few other <br>
thoughts.<br>
S.<br>
<br>
1.  Always start with the same colour.  That way you will start to learn <br>
where they go without having to aling the cross until it is finished.  I <br>
always start with white.<br>
<br>
2.  Practice this: start with a cross, and without looking at the cube <br>
scramble it 2 moves, then look at it, solve it in you head, and then <br>
actually do it on the cube (OK that should be fairly easy).  Move to 3, 4, <br>
and then 5 moves.  Once you can do 5 moves this way, you will probably be <br>
able to do the cross for real in under 8 moves nearly all the time.  And if <br>
you are really keen, see if can do it in your head for 6, or 7 moves!<br>
<br>
3.  Katsu has some tips on the cross that you might find helpful:<br>
http://www5.gateway.ne.jp/~katsu-k/cubemainf.html<br>
... and then follow the link at the top &quot;CROSS&quot;<br>
You can run his page through a translator but there is no need to bother if <br>
all you want to do is look at his java applets on the cross.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You speedcubists are lucky. You only need to concentrte of one cube 
to mke it a good cube. But I have to worry about 490 of  them, 
although if I had 490 lubed, easy-to-turn cubeus for speedcubing, it 
might make life asier for me as well.  Oh yes, my cubes should be 
paired. 490 cubes, that makes  245 parity pairs. 

Oh, I wish I could have 1000 cubes in 500 such pairs! Than things 
like a third iteration Menger Sponge, more symmetric Bohemian Pyramid 
and a Ladry Staircase having 125  (27) blocks with 8 (27) cubes per 
block would be within my reach. Right now all I can do is drem about 
such designs.

wc2003 yahoo group is for actual registered competitors of the
wc2003 event which is why you were removed...

but not to worry, wc2003 is not used much and there is only 5
weeks left at which time it will be shut down and reopened

My best average (set a couple weeks ago) is 25.9.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m arriving in Toronto on the Tuesday evening before the event, and my<br>
wife is coming in on Thursday evening.  She doesn&#x27;t cube much.  I taught<br>
her how, but she has to read from the notes I made for her while she is<br>
solving.  A while back, I used to see if I could solve a 5x5x5 before<br>
she finished the 3x3x3, and she started beeathing me, so she was<br>
probably solving in 4.5 or 5 minutes.  She&#x27;s hoping that I can<br>
participate in non-cubing activities with her on Friday.<br>

By the way, where can I get a studio cube? I know Ton&#x27;s site, but

You know there is time to adapt to the new stickers when we use a painted 
cube. I use a painted cube and I like this a lot. Where can I get stickers 
then ?
I think the sponsors should send stickers before WC to the cubers.

<br>
Also, check out the link to Mirek Goljan&#x27;s 24 move solution for the 06/06/03 FMC, in which he shows how he beat Guus Razoux Schultz&#x27;s 27 move solution from several years ago. This is available on the Cube Station homepage!<br>
<br>
A new challenge wil be launched at midnight, I hope you all find the time to take part!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I call this my &quot;GIVE ME A BREAK&quot; speech.... sorry if it offends 
anyone, which it probably will.

Ok let me get a complete clearification on this (the sticker issue):

1. We are allowed to use any brand of cube we like. (Even if its 
dimensions are slightly bigger or larger? Or maybe a separate or sub-
category competition for those using key chain cubes.) We are not 
allowed to sand the outside? One of my main cubes was accidently 
dropped last yr and there&#x27;s  bit of corner missing, would this be 
allowed? How about all WHITE plastic instead of black?

2. I know we must show the rubik&#x27;s logo on the white side (would we 
get disqualified if we place the logo on a corner piece instead of 
center?). What about the tiled cubes? Can we just stick the stickers 
over the tiles? Are we allowed to to leave our normal stickers 
underneth? I use custom stickers, if the stickers are too large and 
show after placing &quot;official&quot; stickers over them will we be 
disquaified? What if a sticker or two falls off as we solve? We we 
be need to justify using group theory that it is in deed solved? 
Maybe people with tiled cubes or painted cubes need to razorblade or 
scratch them off before comming. If we want the official stickers 
early, will we have to pay the usual $4.99 for them? Probably not, 
then is there a limit to how many will be provided, if not I&#x27;d want 
a few dozen sets to resicker some of the nearly 20 cubes I have 
around the house (not including tiled or painted ones of course).

3. Do we need to use the official color scheme? What if I don&#x27;t like 
their tint of orange? I heard that we ARE allowed our own color 
scheme. What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)? 
I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their main 
cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple! Opps no 
purple in the Hessport/Seventowns stash... Guess they&#x27;ll just have 
to leave it blank. &quot;Hemm not all 6 &#x27;official&#x27; colors are present, 
you are hearby disqualified!&quot;

Honestly though, the normal stickers that come with new Hessport 
cubes are terrible, crappy, and disturbingly tikalish to the fingers 
when they peel; wouldn&#x27;t last a week on my cube (I solve ~250 times 
a day). It&#x27;d be a sad day when all the cubists in the world 
prescribe to the identical stickers and color scheme. Ultimately 
variety is the spice of life and diversity needs to be upheld. 
What&#x27;s next...? &quot;All competitors must solve corners first.&quot;
!@#$ that.

Anyone out there have an opinion on this issue? BTW I am working on 
obtaining a mass production of pre-cut VINYL stickers (1,200), I 
might bring part the stash to Toronto if it gets finished in time. 
(still seeking a satisfactory orange...)

          <div class="email-content">AND WE ARE OFF!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some excellent questions!! But where have you been Man!!! <br>
Sleeping!!???<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; I call this my &quot;GIVE ME A BREAK&quot; speech.... sorry if it offends <br>
&gt; anyone, which it probably will.<br>
<br>
danG-not!! I had a really good laugh!!! for once!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Ok let me get a complete clearification on this (the sticker <br>
issue):<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. We are allowed to use any brand of cube we like. (Even if its <br>
&gt; dimensions are slightly bigger or larger? Or maybe a separate or <br>
sub-<br>
&gt; category competition for those using key chain cubes.) We are not <br>
&gt; allowed to sand the outside? One of my main cubes was accidently <br>
&gt; dropped last yr and there&#x27;s  bit of corner missing, would this be <br>
&gt; allowed? How about all WHITE plastic instead of black?<br>
<br>
<br>
danG-good lord man - where have you been!!...Only Rubiks brand <br>
products are permitted!!..no clones!!..period....this has been <br>
indicated on this forum a million times along with the rubiks web <br>
site....Key Chain Cubes????  NOT!!!<br>
<br>
sanding - where have you been man.....&quot;no cutting corners&quot; ie if an <br>
edge is 90 degree&#x27;s your not permitted to round it off. sanding is <br>
only permitted to sand any imperfections of the plastic. 3x3x3 cubes <br>
will be inspected prior to each round.<br>
<br>
the plastic is black!!! anything else is a knockoff. if you break a <br>
cubie replace it or it will be replaced for you upon your arrival if <br>
you dont have spare parts....<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. I know we must show the rubik&#x27;s logo on the white side (would <br>
we <br>
&gt; get disqualified if we place the logo on a corner piece instead of <br>
&gt; center?). <br>
<br>
<br>
danG - where have you been man! ...The Rubiks brand places the logo <br>
on the white centre sticker. if you show up and its on a corner it <br>
will be relocated!!! I wont disqualify someone because of a sticker <br>
in the wrong place......<br>
<br>
<br>
What about the tiled cubes? Can we just stick the stickers <br>
&gt; over the tiles? <br>
<br>
danG-yes<br>
<br>
<br>
Are we allowed to to leave our normal stickers <br>
&gt; underneth? I use custom stickers, if the stickers are too large <br>
and <br>
&gt; show after placing &quot;official&quot; stickers over them will we be <br>
&gt; disquaified?<br>
<br>
danG-where have you been man!! - would you like a couple of NEW <br>
cubes????<br>
<br>
Can we have a closeup picture of this beast your referring to which <br>
you will be using as your primary cube for the event..If it looks <br>
like crap then we will resticker the whole thing before hand..<br>
<br>
Its the sponsors that want all the cubes to look pretty(dont make no <br>
difference to me personally)..<br>
<br>
So for 2 days lets all just do what we have to do and get this over <br>
with.....<br>
<br>
<br>
 What if a sticker or two falls off as we solve?<br>
<br>
danG-make that happen and i will give you 20 bucks!! you will be <br>
supplied stickers as required!!!........they ar enot for sale i dont <br>
believe but i can ask for them to bring a few hundred rolls ok!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
danG-get a new cube for the event!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 3. Do we need to use the official color scheme? What if I don&#x27;t <br>
like <br>
&gt; their tint of orange?<br>
<br>
<br>
danG-where have you been man!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO...if you dont <br>
like THEIR TINT OF ORANGE THEN BRING YOUR OWN!!!...<br>
<br>
come on dude!!!!..its a sticker.......you come here...we have <br>
camera&#x27;s....if your cube looks like crap then like i said....we make <br>
it look good.....<br>
<br>
2 days man 2 days...make the cube look good and forget the <br>
issues.....concentrate of giving us your best time....!!<br>
<br>
<br>
 I heard that we ARE allowed our own color <br>
&gt; scheme.<br>
<br>
danG-where have you been man !! WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED COLOR <br>
SCHEMES PERMITTED!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)? <br>
&gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their main <br>
&gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple! Opps no <br>
&gt; purple in the Hessport/Seventowns stash... Guess they&#x27;ll just have <br>
&gt; to leave it blank. &quot;Hemm not all 6 &#x27;official&#x27; colors are present, <br>
&gt; you are hearby disqualified!&quot;<br>
<br>
danG-buy a new cube!!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Honestly though, the normal stickers that come with new Hessport <br>
&gt; cubes are terrible, crappy, and disturbingly tikalish to the <br>
fingers <br>
&gt; when they peel; wouldn&#x27;t last a week on my cube (I solve ~250 <br>
times <br>
&gt; a day).<br>
danG-agreed!! good lord, i am agreeing.....but have been advised by <br>
hessport that they are now shipping the good stickers....just make <br>
sure you specify it when you order.<br>
<br>
 It&#x27;d be a sad day when all the cubists in the world <br>
&gt; prescribe to the identical stickers and color scheme. Ultimately <br>
&gt; variety is the spice of life and diversity needs to be upheld. <br>
&gt; What&#x27;s next...? &quot;All competitors must solve corners first.&quot;<br>
&gt; !@#$ that.<br>
<br>
danG-good lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have been <br>
adhearing to 2 color schemes in the mainstream for 25 years....<br>
your the only one with a color scheme issue and sticker issue that <br>
all can be easlily resolved....<br>
<br>
see you in a month......you just set yourself up for a major cube <br>
inspection when you get here...thats for sure....<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, it was primarily trial and error with some exceptions. For <br>
example, the three-cycle of edges and corners is a simple <br>
commutator. The permutations Z, H, E, and N (see my page)<br>
are &quot;logical&quot; moves as well. Some of the remaining permutation <br>
algorithms could be derived from algorithms that swap two corners <br>
and two edges and looking at cyclical versions of them.<br>
<br>
The trial and error is not that inefficient, btw, even though it <br>
might sound as the &quot;monkey typing Shakespeare&quot; example. What we did <br>
was to mess up the first two layers) using, say, 5-6 moves and then <br>
we tried to assemble them again but, of course, not using the <br>
inverse 5-6 moves. This is, actually, pretty efficient and one does <br>
not need THAT much time to invent most of the moves. What helps you <br>
is that with most moves, you killed two positions with one stone <br>
(the inverse usually solved a different position).<br>

          <div class="email-content">The discussion about how the algorithms were discovered during the <br>
early 80&#x27;s reminded me of our early attempts to find all short <br>
algorithms that swap two edges and two corners (e2c2). Such <br>
algorithms were important for LL permutations T, V, F, R, J, and Y. <br>
During the early 80&#x27;s, we knew that the shortest algorithm of this <br>
type must have at least 13 quarter moves (the number of q-moves must <br>
be odd). By writing the algorithms in some alphabetically smallest <br>
form, we tried to find all different e2c2 moves that had 13 q-moves. <br>
Then, we started collecting all e2c2 moves with 15 q-moves. The list <br>
of algorithms that we collected is on my page<br>
<br>
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/c2e2.html<br>
<br>
All of those algorithms were found using the trial and error method <br>
I described in my previous posting, btw :) I am curious if the list <br>
for 13 q-moves is complete (I think it is). I suspect that the list <br>
of 15-q moves is not complete. I wonder if anyone was interested in <br>
writing a computer program that would find all such algorithms. <br>
(Note that inversions, reflections, face renaming, and cyclical <br>
permutations of one algorithms form one &quot;class of equivalence&quot; and <br>
thus should be identified as one algorithm).<br>

It&#x27;s 9 moves start to end so 2 seconds is very achievable.

Start with two columns and 4 rows:

XX
XX
XX
XX

with the correct side opposite (there are two ways to do this but 
for one way up the moves won&#x27;t work so you can quickly learn which 
way to go).

1. Push away from you to form a ring.
2. Rotate the ring once clockwise.
3. Push away from you to get a column like at the start. (As I 
recall, if it was the wrong way up to start with you can&#x27;t get this 
far.)
4. Flip the top row and bottom row towards you.
It&#x27;ll now look like 
XX
XX
(each X is two squares deep).
5. Flip the two columns from the back round.
XXXX
XXXX
6. Continue with the right one.
XXX
XXX
(the right column is 2 deep)
7. Flip the lower right X up
XXX
XXX
(the upper right X is 3 deep)
8. and then left
XXX
XXX
(the upper right X and the upper middle X are 2 deep)
9. Then pull the upper two X&#x27;s up.
 XX
XXX
XXX

It should now be solved (and I mean properly, not just into the 
correct shape.) It&#x27;s years since I&#x27;ve seen one of these, but I&#x27;m 
sure that&#x27;s the way I used to do it.

What exactly constitutes a move is arguable.
1.-3. above can be done very fast and so can 4.-9.
In some sense you can practically trigger the entire solution.

You can solve it with your feet too. My best time was 18 seconds.
It&#x27;s better to do it on a fixed surface (not a rug for instance) but 
one with a bit of friction (not smooth wood) if you are solving with 
your feet.

&gt; products are permitted!!..no clones!!..period....this has been <br>
&gt; indicated on this forum a million times along with the rubiks web <br>
&gt; site....Key Chain Cubes????  NOT!!!<br>
<br>
***I don&#x27;t know about millions of times, but I hope that <br>
seventowns/hessport isn&#x27;t the only cube company sponsoring the <br>
event. I&#x27;ve bought a few cubes from Meffert&#x27;s myself and most people <br>
here would agree that their Eastsheen 2x2 is the best 2x2 availible. <br>
Are you saying that if I bring a Meffert&#x27;s cube (or something else <br>
if they are sponsoring) that it&#x27;ll be trashed.<br>
<br>
&gt; the plastic is black!!! anything else is a knockoff. <br>
<br>
***actually no, as DJ also noticed, Rubiks.com manufactured a white <br>
plastic promotional cube.<br>
<br>
&gt; danG - where have you been man! ...The Rubiks brand places the <br>
logo <br>
&gt; on the white centre sticker. if you show up and its on a corner it <br>
&gt; will be relocated!!! I wont disqualify someone because of a <br>
sticker <br>
&gt; in the wrong place......<br>
<br>
***this brings me to the central question: is this a comittee <br>
controlled even or company/sponsor controlled even???<br>
<br>
&gt; danG-where have you been man!! - would you like a couple of NEW <br>
&gt; cubes????<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can we have a closeup picture of this beast your referring to <br>
which <br>
&gt; you will be using as your primary cube for the event..If it looks <br>
&gt; like crap then we will resticker the whole thing before hand..<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Its the sponsors that want all the cubes to look pretty(dont make <br>
no <br>
&gt; difference to me personally)..<br>
<br>
***I don&#x27;t think people should be made to purchase a new cube for <br>
competition (if it comes to it I think if someone shows up cubeless, <br>
a speedcube should be made availible to them for the competition by <br>
the committee). Ok, my own main cubes are fine but I&#x27;m just asking <br>
these questions for my curiousity and to help others. I don&#x27;t want <br>
somebody to get disqualified for something as stupid as not using <br>
the logo sticker. Also, according to your post (#3504), &quot;Please note <br>
that these rules have been in place for years and the <br>
sticker portion was a request of our sponsor&#x27;s for the camera&#x27;s.&quot; If <br>
that is the case then why not leave it open-ended and subjective. I <br>
think if people here are smart enough to solve a cube then they <br>
should be able to tell if their cube looks like crap and do <br>
something about it. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; I think my <br>
wacky stickers - 9/16&quot; with deep 3/32&quot; fillets, are AWSOME (at least <br>
less chance of accidental peeling). So the sponsors should just calm <br>
down; I don&#x27;t think anyone here&#x27;s going to intentionally make Erno&#x27;s <br>
great invention look like it&#x27;s been through hell. <br>
<br>
&gt;  What if a sticker or two falls off as we solve?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; danG-make that happen and i will give you 20 bucks!! you will be <br>
&gt; supplied stickers as required!!!........they ar enot for sale i <br>
dont <br>
&gt; believe but i can ask for them to bring a few hundred rolls ok!!<br>
<br>
***USD or CAD? then again my stickers were custom made (non-<br>
rubiks.com) to prevent this.<br>
 <br>
&gt; danG-get a new cube for the event!<br>
<br>
***Unless someone&#x27;s main cube is pop-happy or in more then 21 pieces <br>
{27 if Studio, not counting screws/springs}, then I don&#x27;t see the <br>
need.<br>
<br>
&gt; danG-where have you been man!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO...if you dont <br>
&gt; like THEIR TINT OF ORANGE THEN BRING YOUR OWN!!!...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; come on dude!!!!..its a sticker.......you come here...we have <br>
&gt; camera&#x27;s....if your cube looks like crap then like i said....we <br>
make <br>
&gt; it look good.....<br>
<br>
***according to post #3448: &quot;2-Your own cube in your own colored <br>
scheme(must use original color&#x27;s).&quot; So perhaps bringing my own <br>
orange/pink will cause a hassle. Exactly, it IS a sticker so why is <br>
the committee making a big deal?<br>
<br>
&gt;  I heard that we ARE allowed our own color <br>
&gt; &gt; scheme.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; danG-where have you been man !! WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED <br>
COLOR <br>
&gt; SCHEMES PERMITTED!!<br>
<br>
***according to your post #3448: &quot;Therefore there is now &quot;NO COLOR <br>
SCHEMES RESTRICTIONS&quot; for this <br>
championship.&quot; You say Rubik&#x27;s produced... please clarify. There <br>
are/were several &quot;rubiks&quot; companies: Arxon, Ideal, Hessport, <br>
Meffert, etc... and some knock-offs I admit, but my first cube was a <br>
knock-off gift and I guess after 7-8 years it has stuck.<br>
<br>
&gt;  What about something like White opposite Black(no sticker)? <br>
&gt; &gt; I KNOW someone in the unofficial top 10 uses this on their main <br>
&gt; &gt; cubes. Heck, I bet someone wants Green opposite Purple! <br>
&gt; danG-buy a new cube!!!!!<br>
<br>
***I know of cubists faster then me that prefer odd color schemes. <br>
Heck, people I&#x27;ve taught want to get fast enough and make up their <br>
own &#x27;signature&#x27; color schemes as I have done.<br>
<br>
&gt; danG-good lord...the above is crap and you know it!!!...we have <br>
been <br>
&gt; adhearing to 2 color schemes in the mainstream for 25 years....<br>
&gt; your the only one with a color scheme issue and sticker issue that <br>
&gt; all can be easlily resolved....<br>
<br>
***I seriously doubt I&#x27;m the only one with these types of issues <br>
(which should be clarified before and not during the event), perhaps <br>
there are people out there that are just afraid to ask for fear of <br>
sounding like a nag. Also, when reading the official rules on <br>
Rubikschamps.com I was shocked at how short all of it was.<br>
<br>
&gt; see you in a month......you just set yourself up for a major cube <br>
&gt; inspection when you get here...thats for sure....<br>
<br>
***No my cube should be perfectly fine according to the various <br>
rules set by the committee, at least at one point in time or another <br>
(during redraftings of the rules)...<br>
<br>
&gt; haha<br>
<br>
***Another crucial point: I think the questions posed by people in <br>
this fourm shouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly. If nothing else, at least <br>
it&#x27;ll be good practice for when a crowd of cubists come up to the <br>
front desk with a marid of complaints. If questions were answered <br>
more carefully, we would have significantly least pots that start <br>
with &quot;I still have a question about...&quot; For instance back in March, <br>
someone asked about color blindness and special stickers, pointing <br>
out that just because you or I don&#x27;t have it, that it is indeed <br>
common among the general population. [post #3450,3454] &quot;that would <br>
mean that they have a red/green deficiency in their eyes <br>
and should have it looked at...&quot; I think that condition is permenent <br>
and the responds could have been more forthcomming. Hopefully, when <br>
someone with other disabilities will get the proper attention at the <br>
event.<br>
<br>
***By the way, in regards to the external sanding... After 4 years <br>
with the same cube, the sweat, amino acids, and soda in contact with <br>
my &quot;standard Hessport&quot; cube has surely left its edges and verticies <br>
noticibly rounded. Heck it&#x27;s a millimeter or two smaller then the <br>
two new ones I bought last night.<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, Homer Heads arn&#x27;t so great for speedcubing... as <br>
I just found out (as I was watching the Simpsons nontheless) :).<br>
<br>
-Doug<br>
<br>
P.S. [post #5436]&quot;main stream cubes are black...always have been <br>
always will be....&quot;<br>
<br>
***What so great about mainstream? If everyone thought so, who would <br>
be brave enough to jump out of an airplane with a cube?<br>

&gt; &gt; How can you get it under 2 seconds without breaking the darn <br>
&gt; &gt; thing!!!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
I remember being able to get it done in close to 1 second.<br>
<br>
&gt; with the correct side opposite (there are two ways to do this but <br>
&gt; for one way up the moves won&#x27;t work so you can quickly learn which <br>
&gt; way to go).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Push away from you to form a ring.<br>
&gt; 2. Rotate the ring once clockwise.<br>
&gt; 3. Push away from you to get a column like at the start. (As I <br>
&gt; recall, if it was the wrong way up to start with you can&#x27;t get this <br>
&gt; far.)<br>
&gt; 4. Flip the top row and bottom row towards you.<br>
&gt; It&#x27;ll now look like <br>
&gt; XX<br>
&gt; XX<br>
&gt; (each X is two squares deep).<br>
&gt; 5. Flip the two columns from the back round.<br>
&gt; XXXX<br>
&gt; XXXX<br>
<br>
By taking advantage of how the wires criss-cross, it&#x27;s possible to twist<br>
it in an abnormal way, and do all of the above in one move. This is what<br>
enables very fast times.<br>
<br>
(Be careful not to break it!)<br>
<br>
For this move, finger positions are very important. Looking from above,<br>
I&#x27;ll lable the important squares:<br>
<br>
ABXC<br>
XXDE<br>
<br>
Thumbs on top:<br>
<br>
A = left thumb<br>
E = right thumb<br>
<br>
Fingers on bottom:<br>
<br>
A = left index finger<br>
B = left middle finger<br>
C = right index finger<br>
D = right middle finger<br>
<br>
Hold the thing flat in front of you, face up, like so:<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
With your fingers in place, bend it like this:<br>
<br>
-v-<br>
<br>
Move the left and right sides in closer until they meet in the middle,<br>
but keep your middle fingers firm, pushing their squares in opposite<br>
directions. Now, this is hard to draw in ascii art, but it should look<br>
something like this:<br>
__<br>
/\<br>
<br>
Now here&#x27;s the trick, and be aware that this could damage your puzzle if<br>
done incorrectly, so don&#x27;t hold me responsible! With your whole right<br>
hand, you need to twist the right half of the puzzle toward you, in an<br>
anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) motion. This is assisted by your<br>
right thumb, right index finger, and left middle finger all applying<br>
force to twist it in that direction.<br>
<br>
DO NOT FORCE IT! With very little force, you can immediately see whether<br>
it&#x27;s started to do the trick. If not, go back and make sure all the<br>
wires are aligned again. If done correctly, the wires should not come<br>
off.<br>
<br>
Now keep twisting. It should move very easily. Once you&#x27;ve almost<br>
twisted it the complete 180 degrees, you will need some further<br>
assistance from the back sides of your fingers, in both your left and<br>
right hands. Now touching the backs of your fingers, you&#x27;ll see two<br>
flaps (each made up of two squares). Your right hand needs to flip the<br>
flap that&#x27;s above it over to the left side, and your left hand needs to<br>
flip the flap that&#x27;s below it (your left hand is upsidedown) to the<br>
right side. This should enable you to complete the 180 twist. Your<br>
thumbs will be pressed between the flaps. Remove them. You should now<br>
have a shape like this:<br>
<br>
XX<br>
XX<br>
<br>
Simply unfold it into:<br>
<br>
XXXX<br>
XXXX<br>
<br>
And proceed.<br>
<br>
Once you get better at it, you can use your thumbs to unfold it instead<br>
of removing them. This can all be done in a split second.<br>
<br>
Of course, the rest can be done very quickly since you just hold onto<br>
one X:<br>
<br>
&gt; 6. Continue with the right one.<br>
&gt; XXX<br>
&gt; XXX<br>
&gt; (the right column is 2 deep)<br>
&gt; 7. Flip the lower right X up<br>
&gt; XXX<br>
&gt; XXX<br>
&gt; (the upper right X is 3 deep)<br>
<br>
you mean flip the upper right X down<br>
XXX<br>
XXX<br>
(the lower right X is 3 deep and the upper right X is 1 deep)<br>
<br>
8. and then left<br>
XX<br>
XXX<br>
<br>
There are also a few steps you missed after this one:<br>
<br>
8.1 and then continue move the same X up<br>
XXX<br>
XXX<br>
(the upper middle X is 3 deep)<br>
<br>
8.2 then right<br>
XXX<br>
XXX<br>
(the upper middle and upper right Xs are both 2 deep)<br>
<br>
Then your final step:<br>
<br>
&gt; 9. Then pull the upper two X&#x27;s up.<br>
&gt;  XX<br>
&gt; XXX<br>
&gt; XXX<br>

hilarious!!!  What are we doing...  entering a cube into a fasion

I&#x27;m sure all of you know what i&#x27;m talking about.  We knoe our cubes 
better then ourselves, a scratch on the yellow blue piece, a dimple 
on a red, a squeak from the green center.  I think it would be neat 
as a person watching to see all the different 3x3s and what the 
cubers have done.  It brings a kind of mysteryious ownership sense 
when seing someone elses cube.  Maybe I&#x27;m just disgustingly obsessed

          <div class="email-content">In chess tournaments aren&#x27;t they supposed to use only vinyl chess 
boards, with only a limited number of chess sets available (they have 
to conform to certain specs)?  I think we&#x27;re fighting here over stuff 
so trivial, that we&#x27;re not even really talking about anything.  I 
agree that a cubist having their own cube and color scheme makes your 
cube personalized.  A good chess player will probably have a &quot;good 
board&quot; that they are very proud of, yet they still use a vinyl chess 
board and an aproved chess set in a tournament.  How is it any 
different for a cubist to have their own &quot;good cube&quot; but use 
an &quot;official&quot; cube in a competition? It seems to work for the chess 
community - why are we even fighting over this?

Just do it the same way the chess players do, use your own 
personalized cube, but also train on a competition &quot;approved&quot; cube 
every now and then to be sharp if you choose to go to a competition.  
If a cubist decides to not go to a competition, they wouldn&#x27;t have to 
worry about practicing on an approved cube.

I just think all this bickering is getting no where.

Blast me if you want, but seriously what&#x27;s the problem here?

Chris, where is the problem if we use our own cube and if the camera can <br>

Right, it&#x27;s a long time since I did it. I thought my move count was 
a bit short.
So it would be as you say.
I&#x27;ve only seen them once in the last 13-15 years or so, so my memory 
is a bit rusty.

UB&#x27;L2F2BD2LD&#x27;FR&#x27;U2FU&#x27;D2L2D&#x27;B2UL2 but the Y isn&#x27;t quite 2 colours. 
I&#x27;m fairly sure that you can&#x27;t get them all 2 colours with the Y in 
any of the other 4 faces.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
By which I mean a position which is reached using an algorithm w <br>
whose order is prime.<br>
<br>
My scribblings which (disclaimer) were calculated using pencil and <br>
paper without calculator etc.  (and not checked) indicate that there <br>
are <br>
<br>
170,911,549,183 positions of order 2<br>
<br>
(and 10,938,339,147,775 in the supergroup)<br>
<br>
59,807,090,449,754 positions of order 3<br>
<br>
133,637,037,514,624 positions of order 5<br>
<br>
153,245,476,454,400 positions of order 7<br>
<br>
44,590,694,400 positions of order 11<br>
<br>
Of course there are no positions of order p where p is a prime <br>
greater than 11.<br>
<br>
It follows that there are <br>
<br>
346,905,106,662,361 positions of prime order and for the supergroup <br>
there are 357,672,534,260,953 positions of prime order.<br>
<br>
Now (I used Mathematica for this)<br>
<br>
346,905,106,662,361 has just 3 prime factors (one is pretty easy to <br>
find, so I&#x27;m ashamed to say I went straight to the machine), <br>
13 is the smallest and 3,400,087 and 7848331 are the other 2. 13 is <br>
the smallest prime not to divide the order of the group.<br>
<br>
According to Mathematica 357,672,534,260,953 is prime, though <br>
whether that just means it is a probable prime I&#x27;m not sure as I <br>
don&#x27;t know what method it is using to test here. Since the number is <br>
quite small (having a square root of less than 1,900,000) I imagine <br>
it conceivably could have used a sieve of Erastosthenes method, <br>
although I&#x27;m sure it didn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m willing to believe it probably <br>
is prime and thus that the number of prime positions in the <br>
supergroup is prime.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">If the cube has been re-stickered with officially provided stickers, 
including the centre white logo sticker, then would this be 
satisfactory (assuming that it&#x27;s black plastic)?

If someone had an old cube that had been restickered ages ago and 
they can&#x27;t remember what the original stickers/packaging looked like, 
then how would the competitor know whether the cube was okay to use 
in the competition? If a cube has the official Rubik&#x27;s stickers (as 
provided at the competition), including the Rubik&#x27;s logo on the 
centre white, then would this cube be any less &#x27;eligible&#x27; for 
competition than a new Rubik&#x27;s cube?

Also, when the stickers are provided, I assume that we&#x27;re free to 
choose whether we want to use (for example) a white opp. yellow 
configuration or white opp. blue configuration? The rules seem to 
suggest that this is okay, so no need to reply on this point unless 
I&#x27;ve got it wrong.

          <div class="email-content">I have two questions about the new cubes produced for the <br>
competition. I apologise if these questions have been asked and <br>
answered before, I had a bit of a look around and didn&#x27;t see them, <br>
but I might have just missed something. Anyway...<br>
<br>
What colour configuration are the new cubes? What I&#x27;m most interested <br>
in is are they white opp. yellow or white opp. blue? (I&#x27;m assuming <br>
that they are one of these two?)<br>
<br>
If we did want to use one of the new cubes, when would we be able to <br>
purchase them? At registration? I assume we&#x27;d be allowed to have a <br>
play with one first before deciding whether to use it or the cube <br>
we&#x27;ve brought with us?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Question about the &quot;2x2x2 cube - Fastest time from first seeing it to <br>
solving it&quot; category... if when the cube first came out of it&#x27;s <br>

in a solved state in the box) and then 30 seconds solving it, would <br>
their time for this record be 30 seconds or 45 seconds?<br>
<br>
This question is probably not very relevant for something like the <br>
4x4x4 because the initial scrambling time when it first comes out of <br>
the box is negligible (well, this was certainly true for me anyway), <br>
but with something like the 2x2x2, any 3x3x3 speedcuber would solve <br>
it quickly straight away (as long as they realised that it&#x27;s <br>
basically just like solving the corners of a 3x3x3).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, I&#x27;ve been gone for two days and I&#x27;ve missed the entire 
conversation that I started... :)
On the official website or somewhere, they said that they think of 
having us use their own cube is similar to having someone use their 
own skis in a ski competition, or their own racket in a tennis 
competition. I can see it now....
All the skis have to be bright red!!
The tennis racket strings need to be however tight!!
The skiers have to wear blue snow caps!!
I mean, you know? I agree with whoever said that thing about all 
cubes are different. I even saw someone who had a purple face and a 
black face on his cube. It&#x27;s original, and it&#x27;ll show whoever happens 
to be watching the TV that we care about our cubes, and we make them 
special for our own personal preferences.
I for one don&#x27;t want to depaint my cube (or whatever you would call 
it), so I&#x27;ll probably use the cubes provided there.

I&#x27;ve taught three people to solve it, but they&#x27;ve all lost interest,

don&#x27;t start the time with a 3x3x3 when it&#x27;s solved, and stop it after

subject, i just thought it was a funny topic because i&#x27;m sure all of 
us can pertain to the &quot;grundgy&quot; more &quot;personalized&quot;  cube that we all 
prefer using.  I thought it was kinda funny how the previous posts 
came off as we are dressing up our cubes for some sort of ritzi party 
wearing their expensive suites and dresses and makeup just to make 
them camera appealing.  I;m totally cool with a spruced out cube but 
yeah...  maybe its my sense of humor or something.  Oh well.  
Speaking of sprucing up.. Are we competitors all going to have to be 
preped.  I myself could use a new set of &quot;stickers&quot; to wear and maybe 
the rubik&#x27;s logo slapped on my forehead....  hehehe ok I&#x27;m sorry, 
I&#x27;ll put my sense of humor away for the moment.  Are we all going to 
have to wear t shirts with our name and country and stuff?

          <div class="email-content">DanG,
Now I&#x27;m confused (but entertained too!)... does the sanding rule
pertain to not being allowed to sand the inside of the cube, the
outside, or both?  I thought the issue was whether we could sand
the inside, but this post now makes me wonder.

Thanks,
Adam

          <div class="email-content">All,<br>
I&#x27;ve read these posts, and thought I&#x27;d weigh in.  This is not a<br>
traditional Olympic sport.  This is a competition for a puzzle<br>
that is sold as a toy, and the sponsor is a toy company. <br>
Therefore, they want to make sure their product looks<br>
good--remember that they are sponsoring this because they&#x27;re<br>
hoping it will make more people want to buy their product.  If<br>
people want to exercise more flexibility here, the time to take<br>
up that issue is BEFORE any sponsor agreement is signed, not a<br>
month prior to the competition.  Let&#x27;s remember that if there&#x27;s a<br>
contest next year and give Dan a break this year.<br>
<br>
And remember that it could be worse... I&#x27;m sure most of you have<br>
seen that picture of the 1982 competition with everyone wearing<br>
the same t-shirt with the tacky design that looked about a size<br>
too small on everyone!<br>

Truly no offense to anybody but i found this post utterly <br>

what <br>
makes the cube has its own personality reflected throught the<br>
cuber.  <br>
I&#x27;m sure all of you know what i&#x27;m talking about.  We knoe our<br>

better then ourselves, a scratch on the yellow blue piece, a<br>

on a red, a squeak from the green center.  I think it would be<br>
neat <br>
as a person watching to see all the different 3x3s and what the <br>
cubers have done.  It brings a kind of mysteryious ownership<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, there could be a couple of reasons. One, someone just put in the subject line &quot; [Speed cubing group] &quot; and sent a message. The second way could be that someone opened up a telnet program and spoofed an e-mail... like I could send an e-mail that looks like it came from you, with the e-mail address and everything looking right, but you did not send it. I could send an e-mail to this group such that Yahoo believes the e-mail came from Chris Hardwick because the e-mail is &quot;from&quot; him. The message could be &quot;I am canceling this group.&quot; The less-wise would believe it. The only difference is my IP address could be looked up in the headers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Simple, chess is a two-player competition and the cube is not. So 
for chess standards must be set. And even so, debated and agreed 
upon by a committee (hopefully without &quot;company/sponsor&quot; 
interference). And I&#x27;m sure back in &#x27;97, Deep Blue wouldn&#x27;t have 
mined if Kasparov played it using his chose of board and pieces, 
brand and style. Because in this case it&#x27;d be the equivalent of a 
single player event as is cubing.

sanding...inside outside...dont matter...

sanding.......no cutting corners!!......what this means is that if 
there is a 90 degree edge your not permitted to round it off....your 
only permitted to sand down imperfections in the plastic....where 
ever that might occur....

its like buying a model.....some pieces have that extra plastic that 
you have to shave off....

that same thing can occur on cubie pieces...........thats what we 
are referring to and thats all folks!!...

just bring a normal cube...we will put the clothes on it upon 
arrival.....

or the sponsors are i should say.......i will be running around with

it&#x27;s kind of funny, my friend taught me how to do one face back in 
5th grade, i think it was.  and just a week or two ago (9 years

hi, thanks for your help, but i can&#x27;t seem to recreate your reults.

is that sequence to be done on a completed cube?  i tried 3 times, 
and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work :(  i get the O, but no J or Y.  are you 
sure you typed it right?

thanks again

Without financial backing from the sponsors, there is no Toronto! It <br>
is as simple as that. And who else but a toy company. a cube <br>
manufacturer, would sponsor such an event? It is logical.<br>
<br>
I think Dan is doing all he can to make this event a success, and I <br>
hope it is successful. The Championship does  more than establish <br>
records. It brings new areas of the cube the attention of the world, <br>
such as new types of speedcubing, computer cubing and cube art. That <br>
no one could be found whodoes 3d cube art is somehing I did not <br>
foresee in my wildest dreams and I am truly amazed. I  hope qe will <br>
also see underwater cubing, one-handed  and feet cubing, and <br>
othertypes of cubing.  It should be fun!<br>

&gt; what <br>
&gt; makes the cube has its own personality reflected throught the<br>
&gt; cuber.  <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m sure all of you know what i&#x27;m talking about.  We knoe our<br>
&gt; cubes <br>
&gt; better then ourselves, a scratch on the yellow blue piece, a<br>

&gt; on a red, a squeak from the green center.  I think it would be<br>
&gt; neat <br>
&gt; as a person watching to see all the different 3x3s and what the <br>

Must have hit the wrong thing on the screen. Try it backwards from a 
solved cube. i.e. L2U&#x27;B2DL2D2UF&#x27;U2RF&#x27;DL&#x27;D2B&#x27;F2L2BU&#x27;. Actually, I 
just noticed that the J had 3 colours too. : (

This solves the J problem but the Y has 4 colours:

YXY
XYX
WYZ

L&#x27;U2R&#x27;U2B2D2L2F2U&#x27;B2F&#x27;LBF&#x27;L2D2RB&#x27;D2.

That is an easy one...plus if you have an ATM card you can access 
both CAD and USD from alot of ATM&#x27;s here in Toronto...

plus alot of businesses here offer a US exchange rate.....even the 
venue will change it for you...

best thing to do is bring a small amount of running cash and use 
plastic for everything else....

          <div class="email-content">we will supply you with stickers(free) and/or supply you with a cube
(prelubed and official color scheme which you can change to another 
rubiks products color scheme(main stream)).

studio cubes are not rubiks produced products currently in the main 
stream therefore no studio cubes will be offered for sale at the 
event by the sponsors or owners of the name...

and to your final question.....hmmm...your at a world championship 
cube event as a competitor.....I would definately say that you will 
be able to buy a cube......but the term &quot;buy&quot;  should be replaced 
with &quot;aquire!!&quot;...ie for free.....for being a competitor......

bring empty bags for the stuff you&#x27;ll end up with for free....

I believe Seventowns is shipping like 2000 cubes(3,4,5&#x27;s etc)

          <div class="email-content">no lend - you get for free to keep..

but


the cubes they are supplying are prelubed with good stickers and 
they are all blue/green color scheme...(but not endorsed by myself)

if your color scheme dont match their, then you get to change it...


hence reason for showing up early to the event.....

i would also recomend showing up early to get use to the timers and 
you have a new way to stop the time......

You pet your cat
and lube your cube
but lubing your cat
and petting your cube,
you are met 
as being a rube.

how to make fun of your cat without them knowing. I tried the one 
where you put a strip of masking tape on their back, and they think 
they&#x27;re under something so they crawl around on their stomach all 
day. I couldn&#x27;t find masking tape, so I tried duct tape but it didn&#x27;t 
work.

Actually, Tteir old neighbors were the most annoying people on the 
planet, and about once a year my current neighbors cat got out and 
ran across the yard. The neighbors got annoyed, and then their cat 
disappeared. THREE cats disappeared, around the times the neighbor 
complained. And the neighbor constantly wrote letters, threatening 
their cats. That neighbor is the very reason they moved.

          <div class="email-content">We should ask the Rubiks company to make a special Rubiks timer pad. 
The cube is on it, then you pick it up and fifteen seconds later it 
will buzz. You put it back, then a countdown on the pad starts, then 
you pick it up, and when you put it back down solved, the timer 
starts. That would be coool.

Anyway, buy some vinyl tape and cut out squares with an Exacto knife.

          <div class="email-content">Some stickers are bad, so you would have to change them once a month 
or so. But the good ones last for quite a while.
I don&#x27;t know what kind of paint I use. But it stays on for ages. 
What I did to my best cube is take off the plasticky layer on the 
sticker, then paint over only the paper part. This works very well, 
for me.

          <div class="email-content">ps-there is no such thing as a rubiks &quot;company&quot; persay...

we have investigated the production of an actual Timer and it will 
cost 50k to produce and another 100k to market....

after the event some re engineering could occur on the speedstack 
pads which will match our needs a bit more however the it does 
introduce a standard for timing which is basically the same way we 
do now with hitting the space bar on a keyboard to stop our online 
timers....

On your other question, about the music:  I for some reason enjoy cubing to<br>
metal or other comparable rough music, soft music just doesn&#x27;t seem to fit<br>
to me...  My first vid had Bodies by Drowning pool.... not a bad song to<br>
cube to :)  Every now and then I&#x27;ll cube to Enya or Enigma though.  Mostly<br>
anything with a good fast beat... angry music :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I suspect alot of people aren&#x27;t telling how fast they really are <br>
now <br>
&gt; near to the WC. But I think that it doesn&#x27;t matter for me. When we <br>
&gt; will be on stage in the WC it won&#x27;t matter what record we have. I <br>
&gt; think that most people will be maybe 2 seconds slower than their <br>
&gt; best avg. So that&#x27;s why I post this. Don&#x27;t think I will repeat <br>
this <br>
&gt; in the WC...<br>
<br>
I sure hope not, for my sake!  Just kidding....;)  I agree, I think <br>
people will be at best within .5 seconds of their record average, <br>
most likely worse.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Today I broke the unofficial world record. I haven&#x27;t cubed much <br>
&gt; lately and I thought that I should practise some so I wouldn&#x27;t be <br>
&gt; slower. So I made a few averages. At first my avg was something <br>
like <br>
&gt; 18.2 or so. But in an hour my times were much better. Here are my <br>
&gt; times:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 15.74 17.83 17.53 14.69 16.99 16.25 (14.19) 15.7 18.7 14.83 14.83 <br>
&gt; (18.83) = 16.31 <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Awesome times.  Congratulations!  You are now unofficially the <br>
fastest cube solver on the planet, ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; The strange thing was that I during this session talked  with a <br>
&gt; friend in the phone. I may not have been a very active speaker, <br>
but <br>
&gt; I answered questions and saying &quot;yes &quot; or &quot;no&quot; while I was solving <br>
&gt; the cube. This may have had the effect that I wasn&#x27;t &quot;thinking&quot; so <br>
&gt; much, and instead my brain took care of the rest. I couldn&#x27;t <br>
&gt; understand that it went so fast but it did. Someone else who have <br>
&gt; similar experiences?<br>
<br>
Yes, I have had several experiences like this.  A few days ago I was <br>
sitting around chatting with someone during lunch, and I got two <br>
averages in the 17&#x27;s, in one of which the worst time was a 19.  <br>
Another day after I played an exhausting soccer game, I sat in the <br>
back of an open convertible with an aggressive driver (again, not <br>
your best conditions,) and again got an average with only one 19, <br>
and the rest 14-18!<br>
<br>
I think this could have very interesting psychological implications <br>
for speedcubing - that it&#x27;s good to be a little bit distracted.  <br>
Maybe I should have my friend on a cell phone during the WC... :)<br>
<br>
Anyway, congrats again, and I look forward to meeting you at the WC!<br>

As you may be aware, the company is actually named &quot;Seven Towns,

This timer looks pretty good, although unfortunately I expect one 
will lose around half a second during the picking-up and putting-
down times, so perhaps in the future we can do something about 
that.  I have written a small program in Visual Basic (download the 
exe file from the &quot;Files&quot; section) that times quite well (It&#x27;s a 
beta version, lacking many features).  

I also purchased a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard, which has a 
very large central Space Bar, and I use this to do my timing.  Can 
we just write our own custom program, and then use these keyboards 
at the WC?
http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/keyboard/nke_info.asp

If we must use the SPEEDSTACK pads, I think we can help reduce the 
time lost if we allow the competitor to place the cube on the table 
in whatever position he/she prefers after the inspection time has 
ended (I assume that will be the case?).

Another important function required of the timer is that it should 
keep track of multiple end times, in case the competitor 
accidentally puts the cube down unsolved.  Then the competitor must 
pick it up, finish solving, and put his/her hands back down.  There 
should be a log of all of the timer events received during each 
solution, something that could easily be written in my custom 
program.

A really cool song to cube to is called Out of Control, by Darude. 
Also, if you&#x27;re into DDR at all (or even if you&#x27;re not) there is a 
song called &quot;Drop Out&quot; (just do a search &quot;DDR Drop Out&quot;). It gets the

          <div class="email-content">yes and no dan re the Seventowns rubiks company....your correct when 
you say managed however your incorrect when you say they are an 
actual rubiks company..

a company manufacterers which Seventowns does not..SevenTowns 
manages inventions....

irrelevant to the question brough forth either way..

re your timer statements...

today we reach over and hit the space bar(most) and reach over and 
hit the space bar after we perform the solve..

same thing with these timers....

personally i dont care where the cube is placed..just as long as its 
solved...there will be a square where the cube should be placed 
inside however we will not be hard on that respect...just as long as 
the timer stops and the cube is done..there will be 2 backups to the 
timers just in case so not to worry....i expect you best time either 
way..haha

therefore we dont loose anything and will not increse anything by 
using these timers......


these timers look good for the camera and they sure beat out my home 
made design which is just like what you had described....since we 
did not have 150k to manaufacture our own design(in time for the 
championships) we decided to use speedstacks to introduce a brand 
new timing scheme which thus introduces total fairness in a 
competition...

its all a done deal in 33 days anyway so lets just do it and get it 
all done and overwith..

we will leave the timer manufacturer to Seventowns for future 
production after the event...

          <div class="email-content">That cube (or perhaps 2 cubes) does not appear to be of a standard 
color scheme, the one in his had had a white-yellow edge, and the 
solved one had a blue-green edge. The coloring of the shown corner 
of the solved cube does not match up with the white-blue scheme 
either (although matches up with mine). I deduce (frame-by-frame) 
that the cube in the guy&#x27;s hand WAS of white-blue scheme and then 
physically restickered to show it solved (the film had several 
cuts). I suppose that the people who filmed that commercial can&#x27;t 
solve or are too lazy to solve a cube since they had to incorrectly 
resticker it in the end.

          <div class="email-content">I am finally getting around to posting this ;-)<br>
<br>
On June 12, 2003, I held a Rubik&#x27;s Cube competition in my classes at <br>
Temecula Valley High School (California). Many of the participants <br>
were people with less than 2 weeks of practice. They each got three <br>
trials, with other participants scrambling their cubes...fastest <br>
time was recorded.<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
<br>
1. David Matics  49.02<br>
2. Bill Aanestad 1:05.70<br>
3. Bryan Curiel  1:07.00<br>
<br>
The first three are experienced cubists...most of the others, as I <br>
said above, have about 2 weeks experience...<br>
<br>
4. Matt Saul  1:21.79<br>
5. John Randall 1:31.43<br>
6. Robbie Elcome 1:39.97<br>
   Eric Totah  1:39.97<br>
8. Kota Washiyama 1:44.10 (using his own corners first method)<br>
9. Ty Yacoub 1:47.74<br>
10. James Whiteside 2:00.32<br>
11. Ryan Tracy 2:02.79<br>
12. Mark Billhofer 2:28.72<br>
13. John Wardlaw 2:53.20<br>
<br>
Due to time constraints, I only allowed 3 minutes for <br>
solving...several other people could do the cube in 5-6 minutes...<br>
<br>
During my teaching career, I have probably taught a couple of <br>
hundred people to do the cube, but it would be difficult to get an <br>
exact number.  I should have recorded all of their names ;-)<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t teach David Matics to do the cube...he has been doing it <br>
for several years and has a best of about 35 seconds. <br>
<br>
Many of the people in this years competition are juniors (numbers 1, <br>
2, 3, 5, and 9)...I am hoping that we have many sub one minute <br>
cubists next year...<br>

this is not true, very few contestants used that, many opted for a 
corners approach (according to David Singmaster in the Cubic 
Circular). This is indeed an interesting question, but I would guess 
that sevral people figured this out independently.

I also guessed the same thing. For some context, if I were to create a<br>

<br>
It would be easiest with some names, but otherwise I can say that the<br>

  A really cool song to cube to is called Out of Control, by Darude. 
  Also, if you&#x27;re into DDR at all (or even if you&#x27;re not) there is a 
  song called &quot;Drop Out&quot; (just do a search &quot;DDR Drop Out&quot;). It gets the

I am quite sure that there are many people who came up with this <br>
idea for solving the F2L independently, so it will be next to <br>
impossible to find the &quot;inventor&quot;. I learned about it when I joined <br>
the college. There were at least 5 guys (all coming from the same <br>
high school) doing the F2L this way. However, they solved the F2L <br>
kind of intuitively using lots of auxiliary moves with only a <br>
handful of basic intuitive moves. As a result, they were not too <br>
fast, and so I did not pay attention to this idea at first. Then, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

In Holland F2L was first mentioned in the second issue of Cubism For Fun (see
http://cff.helm.lu/), dated october 1981. In that issue Renï¿½ Schoof is
acknowledged as the &#x27;inventor&#x27;.
F2L is fully described in the book &quot;De Hongaarse Kubus voor doordraaiers&quot; (&quot;The
Hungarian Cube for those who cannot stop&quot;) by Frans Schiereck, dated december
1981. That is including pictures and algorithms. That book is the fourth in a
set of four books from that author.
See
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/collection/Books%20and%20Collectibles/pages/De%20
Hongaarse%20kubus%20voor%20Doordraaiers.htm in Ton&#x27;s collection.

OLL/PLL is first described in the third of the four books: &quot;De Hongaarse Kubus
voor Gevorderden&quot; (&quot;The Hungarian Cube for the experienced&quot;), dated november
1981. Hans Dockhorn and Anneke treep were then acknowledges as the &#x27;inventors&#x27;.
The book features complete tables for OLL and PLL (included mirrored cases). But
many algorithms are not optimal yet (all found by hand!!!).
See
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/collection/Books%20and%20Collectibles/pages/De%20
Hongaarse%20kubus%20voor%20Gevorderden.htm

Have fun,

Ron

wide apart are the palm rests spread? What actually stops the timer -
 pressure-sensitive, heat-sensitive, light-sensitve? Althought I

square, it&#x27;s feasible that a competitor would use the solved cube 
to &quot;tap&quot; the part of the pad to stop the timer, what if any would be 
the consequence of such action? Most importantly of all, will teh 
timer stop after one hand is placed on a spot or after both hands 
are there?

          <div class="email-content">glad to finally see some comments about these timers...

my response will be of 2 scenario&#x27;s....first is my personal opinion 
and my Chief Organizor statement...

my opinion and comments re these timers as i have used them are..

the hand pads were you place your hands, in my opinion could be 
spread a part a bit more..

the square box your referring to is only a guide(where the cube will 
be picked up from)......when you solve the cube and place your hands 
back on the hand pads to stop the timers, the cube can be placed 
anywhere on the pad........just make sure you put both hands on the 
hand pads to start and stop the timers...

the resistance from your hands(body) closes the circuit at the 
start.....thus starting the timer once lifted off pads......

cube solved and hands placed back on pads to once again close 
circuit..........thus stopping timer....

when you look at the way we time ourselves these days with online 
timers..there is 1 small problem i have found.....it creates the 
possibility of &quot;false&quot; starts. speedstack timers eliminate this....

When we solve the cube, we have to reach over and bang on the space 
bar(most of us)......speedstack timers do the same thing....once the 
cube os solved you must reach over with both hands and stop the 
timer....


now the RCC team thought about timing. we looked at previous 
events,online timers,home made timers and speedstacks.....

in a world class event and the fact that guiness is involved and we 
have record breaking attempts on the table we were faced with a 
number of issues....

1-sponsors/owners of rubiks want something that lookes very 
presentable(hence the sticker issues)...the timer used in the Korean 
championships did not meet their &quot;looks&quot; standards(however i thought 
it was a cool looking timer - even though it looked like a 
bomb)......
2-We did not want to put a timer issue on the table for Guiness to 
lay down the law thus the creating the possibility of us spending 
thousands on a professionally designed and manufactured timer....yes 
it is very simple to make a timer however in the eyes of guiness and 
the owners, presentation is the main key......not what the timer 
does...

We even went to speedstacks and requested a specially made timer for 
our event with the possibility of future business down the road
(which is still at this time a real possibility)...

Speedstacks came back and indicated in order to produce a prototype 
it would cost over 50k to re-engineer and they also requested a 
50,000 timer commitment order because of the Rubiks history..along 
with a 4 month turn around time.....


Therefore we were left with only 1 option...

To implement a &quot;standard&quot; for competitions with respect to timing.

Speedstack timers suit our requirements at this time. In The future 
there could very well be changes. This timing pad does not apply to 
blindfold cubing.....

there will be 2 backups to the main timer for everyones 
info...lowest time on the backups will take over in case of main 
timer failure...

all competitors will be alocated time upon arrival to become 
familiar with timers....


hope this all helps....for now...once you have solve a cube...take 
the effort and purposely slap both hands on the table or your knee&#x27;s 
or whatever to get use to it.....


hope this all helps....

30 days to go...

          <div class="email-content">i&#x27;ve been cubing about 3 months and use a standard cross, f2l, oll, <br>
pll method.  my oll is a 2-look (orient edges, orient corners), and <br>
my pll is the standard 1-look.  a typical &quot;good&quot; solve for me is in <br>
the high 30&#x27;s, i.e. no gross errors, no total loss of concentration.<br>
<br>
i spend 3 seconds on the cross, 20+ seconds on the f2l corner-edge <br>
pairs, 10 seconds on the last layer.  cross and last layer are <br>
pretty consistent, all the variation in my times comes from the f2l <br>
corner-edge pairs.  i know some of the non-intuitive algs for corner-<br>
edge pairs, but not all of them.  i average about 28-30 moves to <br>
place all 4 corner-edge pairs, which is not too bad considering my <br>
experience level.  but it is time-consuming due to all my pauses!  i <br>
videotaped myself the other day and basicly what i noticed was a <br>
quick cross, followed by a lot of pauses during f2l, then a quick <br>
end (well, quick considering its a 3-look LL).<br>
<br>
any recommendations on practice?  just cube and cube and cube?  if i <br>
just keep &quot;doing it&quot; will i recognize the f2l positions quicker and <br>
have fewer pauses?  or are there some drills/excercises that you <br>
would do if you were me?<br>

Have you tried this:<br>
http://h222n2fls31o933.telia.com/games/concentration/<br>
Some cubists (me being one of them) have found it helpful.  On the smaller <br>
squares you will find that the pacing is similar to F2L.<br>

Dan, thanks for this, which is a help.  I suppose I need to just practice <br>
dropping the cube and slapping the table or something.<br>
<br>
Are you going to have those displays that plug into the mats, so everyone <br>
can see the time?  They look ideal for this sort of event.<br>

cross on top to cross on bottom.  My advice is to quit
doing the cross on top cold turkey.  Incorporate cross
on the bottom whether it be speedcubing or practice
solves, and after awhile it becomes just as natural as
if you were doing the cross on top.  It took me about
a week to be really comfortable with it.

&gt; I am quite sure that there are many people who came up with this <br>

&gt; impossible to find the &quot;inventor&quot;. I learned about it when I joined <br>
&gt; the college. There were at least 5 guys (all coming from the same <br>
&gt; high school) doing the F2L this way. However, they solved the F2L <br>
&gt; kind of intuitively using lots of auxiliary moves with only a <br>
&gt; handful of basic intuitive moves. As a result, they were not too <br>
&gt; fast, and so I did not pay attention to this idea at first. Then, <br>
&gt; one day just for fun I tried to solve the F2L using this approach <br>
&gt; and quickly saw the _potential_ of this approach. However, it needed <br>
&gt; a substantial &quot;overhaul&quot;. Thus, I developed over a dozen new, less <br>
&gt; obvious algorithms that you can see on my page.<br>
<br>
I agree with your point that it would be next to impossible to find<br>
&quot;the&quot; inventor, although I&#x27;m not really interested in who came up with<br>
the idea first. In my view, all people who came up with it independently<br>
deserve equal credit. (If there were 20 years before rediscovery, that<br>
would be another story ;-)<br>
<br>
What I originally set out to do was to make a list of at least some of<br>
the people who came up with the idea, but even that sounds like it may<br>
be a difficult task. Schoof was one guy who is said to have discovered<br>
it, but if in reality there are more like 10 people who discovered it,<br>
then it may not be good to give all credit to Schoof.<br>
<br>
And also, the people who first gave you the idea to do the F2L this way<br>
only used the idea in a very primitive way, and so it seems to me that<br>
you really did all the work to make it into a world class speed cubing<br>
system. I think you deserve as much credit here. I looked everywhere on<br>
the Internet to find out this piece of history about your method, but<br>
I&#x27;m glad to finally read it in this email. Maybe you could add a bit to<br>
your short historical narrative?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dan, as you can see in this group, people are trying to get a handle <br>
on the competitors for the WC.  Several informal mechanisms have <br>
sprung up, like the database associated with this group.  I assume at <br>
some point more official detail will be made available--I&#x27;m sure the <br>
media will want it at some point.  It would be nice to know how many <br>
people are registered for each category of competition (e.g. 3x3 <br>
speed cubing, 4x4 speed cubing, 3x3 least moves, etc).<br>
<br>
Also, when will we be told the actual format for the 3x3 speed cubing <br>
event (and other events)?  What we know now is that there is some <br>
elimination on Saturday, and finals on Sunday.  What we don&#x27;t is:<br>
1) how the elimination works/what types of competition are going to <br>
be used for each round (e.g. best time out of 3, average of 10)?<br>
2) approx. what time of day each of the heats are scheduled?<br>
3) will the eliminations be based on a time target or # of <br>
competitors, or some combination?  For example, will the first round <br>
narrow it down to, say, 30 people regardless of how fast or slow they <br>
solve it, or will there be a time target people are going to have to <br>
reach (in which case we won&#x27;t know ahead of time whether 1 or 100 <br>
people are going to make it to the next round)?<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t feel obliged to answer questions here... if that info is going <br>
up on the WC site at some point, it would just be nice to know when.<br>

Using the basic Petrus method with only 3 (not so) magical last-layer
sequences (switch 2 corners + 3-corner orientation + 3-edge
permutation), it&#x27;s possible to reach a sub25 average.

If you want to switch to the standard F2L method...
...just do it ! :-)

I appreciate your concerns and questions however, I am not obligated <br>
to reveal information pertaining to the amount of competitors.<br>
<br>
I will say however that the total official count is 68 with another <br>
20 unregistered.<br>
<br>
Your media related questions are irrelevant to your concerns. If i <br>
did tell everyone everything that is planned then there would be no <br>
suprises. <br>
<br>
There is no elimination on Saturday. I dont know where you got that <br>
from as its not written by me anywhere.....<br>
<br>
Your questions have been answered here a million times regarding <br>
what is happening on each day.<br>
<br>
All competitors will be provided an email with start times etc and <br>
info 1 week prior to the event...<br>
<br>
For now I strongly suggest everyone concerntrating on their own <br>
performances and not worry about logistics..<br>
<br>
Day 1 is meet and great day...you show up ,register,meet and greet <br>
and when your good and ready you step up to the podiums and give me <br>
your best average...<br>
<br>
This day 1 averaging is for seeding and means nothing..Day 1 is <br>
designed for all of you to relax so you can give your best <br>
performance.<br>
<br>
Day two will see the eliminations and without a final competitor <br>
count, I cant reveal the final format plan....<br>
<br>
So not to worry Adam, we are light years ahead and on top of things..<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember one thing.....Be happy!! and practise and be prepared to <br>
meet the gang.<br>

It turns out you have to be 19 years old or older to check into the <br>
room, no exceptions.  I&#x27;ll turn 19 five days after i&#x27;d check in, and <br>
they still wouldn&#x27;t let me get a room.  <br>
<br>
So Dan, could you check into this and figure out whats goin on?<br>
<br>
in the meantime, is there anyone here that is 19 or older and <br>
looking for someone to share a room with?....I want to be in Toronto <br>
on aug. 21st and leave the 25th.<br>
<br>
the only other alternatives is for Dan to find some way to bend the <br>
rules for the hotel and allow people under 19 to check into the <br>
hotel alone, or my dad will have to come with me, and i dont really <br>
want that to happen.<br>

Im sure this will effect more cubers than just me.<br>

<br>
<br>
  I just called the hotel to make reservations for a room for the WC.  <br>
  It turns out you have to be 19 years old or older to check into the <br>
  room, no exceptions.  I&#x27;ll turn 19 five days after i&#x27;d check in, and <br>
  they still wouldn&#x27;t let me get a room.  <br>
<br>
  So Dan, could you check into this and figure out whats goin on?<br>
<br>
  in the meantime, is there anyone here that is 19 or older and <br>
  looking for someone to share a room with?....I want to be in Toronto <br>
  on aug. 21st and leave the 25th.<br>
<br>
  the only other alternatives is for Dan to find some way to bend the <br>
  rules for the hotel and allow people under 19 to check into the <br>
  hotel alone, or my dad will have to come with me, and i dont really <br>
  want that to happen.<br>
<br>
  Im sure this will effect more cubers than just me.<br>

   Before the term &quot;light year&quot; was in common use the expression was
&quot;we are miles ahead...&quot;.
   Yes, a light year is a unit of distance.
   Yes, a calorie is a unit of energy, and in this particular case it
is also part of a joke.
   And I have no idea what units jokes come in.
   Well...

There&#x27;s no SI unit for jokes. Jokes can be qualified but not quantified.

Hey everyone.  I just wanted to make a quick post about a revelation 
of sorts that I have had recently.  For anyone that is interested in 
speed solving, I want to take the time to emphasize exactly how 
utterly and completely important the quality of your cube is to your 
skill as a speed cubist.  I have recently made some pretty big 
improvements, after a very very very long stretch of static times, 
and I now know why.  Anyway for those of you who don&#x27;t know, I had 
been stuck with a personal best average of 22.0 seconds for about 2 
years straight.  This was on a worn out cube that I had been using 
since I first started cubing (1998).  Anyway I was able to improve 
down to the high 21&#x27;s on this cube but then I switched to a studio 
cube.  As I am continually breaking in this studio cube my times have 
gotten consistently better.  What made me want to send this post is 
that I lubed my cube last night, then all of a sudden I set a new 
personal best average today.  Compared to my old junky beat up cube, 
my new cube after this last lubing/cleaning is AMAZING!  It is 
effortless to look ahead and go fast without having to worry about 
the alignment of the faces, not popping it because it is so loose, 
etc..  

So anyway to make a long story short I was stuck in the low twenties 
for 2 years simply because I had a crappy cube.  Now that I have seen 
what a really good cube feels like I know what was holding me back.  
So I just want to say that if any of you are like me and are cubing 
on a loose cube (the corners rattle when you shake it) and you&#x27;re 
stuck at a barrier, don&#x27;t do what I did!!!  Don&#x27;t keep using your old 
cube and getting frustrated that you&#x27;re not improving!  Chunk your 
old cube (well, save it for one handed cubing :-P) but get a new 
speed cube if you want to improve.  I have now realized that a good 
speed cubist not only has to have all the algorithms come to you like 
second nature, dextrous hands and all that, but SOOOO much of getting 
good times is having a good cube.

So in short, don&#x27;t be like me.  Chunk your cube when it wears out for 
a better one if you want to improve.

I&#x27;ll get off my soap box now,
Chris

Everyone,<br>
<br>
I just got back from the International Conference On Thinking XI in Phoenix, Arizona.  Please see www.conferenceonthinking.org .  I have to say it was the most exciting and _awesome_ experience I ever had in my life.  By the way, for those of you who read Michio Kaku&#x27;s books, he himself was there, and I got his autograph, etc etc...  So much knowledge and wisdom just poured through the entire week...  I feel my brain has just clicked &#x27;on&#x27;.  ALSO, I actually set up a room for me to do the cube for an hour session - so I was a speaker in the Conference On Thinking XI, and it was AWESOME.  I made a few times in front of the huge crowd, like 23 flat, 28, 30, (but I haven&#x27;t received my good cube from Ton yet ;)...)  DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THESE Conferences on Thinking?  The last one was in England somewhere, so I thought ONE OF YOU did...;)  Well, thanks to this conference, I am WAY more prepared for the champs coming...  Just very excellent stuff, and I VERY MUCH plan to attend the<br>
 next one in 2005 at Austrailia... <br>
<br>
Oh, for those Wednesday Contest players, I will just extend the current week into a 2 week competition...  Thanks everyone.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Good for the audience, bad for personal use. The mat and display are 
a shocking $200 USD not including shipping. I hope the organizers 
got a good deal for them. How many timers were aquired for the event?

Also, what are they going to do with all those timers afterwards - 
sell them, award them to contestants, save them for future cubing 
competitions? Even though I really don&#x27;t like the mechanism of these 
timers (or their price) it&#x27;d be really sweet to have a setup like 
that in my dorm to peak people&#x27;s interest in cubing and show that I 
am a professional, lol.

brilliant graduate student in the Physics Department. He wqas also 
very nice. I seriously doubt he remembers me, as I am not on his

I would like to exhibit some of my designs atsome such cnference as a

lol, I would never stand outside the hotel hoping someone would take 
me in.  I dont know where you came up with that.  Thats why I was 
asking on here for someone to room with.  So I can get something set 
up beforehand, and plans made.

          <div class="email-content">I think that it&#x27;s not the hotel, but more of a Canada law where 18 
is still considered a minor, but I could be wrong, I&#x27;m from the 
states. Perhaps, DanG could set that one straight.

Anyways, I think that it&#x27;s stupid that the hotel both want 
contestants to stay at their hotel (throwing a banquet and stuff), 
and enforces this age limit at the same time. It&#x27;d of been nice if a 
whole block of rooms could be reserved for us, it&#x27;d be like CUBE 
CENTRAL! But anyways, could the organizers play middle man and do 
reservations for the youngin&#x27;s? I&#x27;m comming alone (under-aged), and 
perhaps my under-aged roommate (David) is also, and Heath is also in 
a similar bind; I really would like to stay with my potential 
roomate if at all possible.

          <div class="email-content">sorry guys, its the law.....has nothing to do with canada or 
anything like that....

you will find this will all hotels!!! in both usa AND canada.

if your under age then just get someone of age to book the room...

this is not a show stopper guys......

your issues should be taken up with the folks on the web site 
responsible for the hotel bookings...

to date i have seen no complaints on the web site. please dont 
expect them to be reading this forum when you all should be 
reporting this issue to the web site..

In the ascending frequency table, 35 and 10 are switched.
Also where it has 495 &amp; 330 there are some missing: 495 &amp; 990, 77 &amp; 
154, 45, 20, 165 &amp; 330.
What do you mean by &quot;the median is 67.3&quot;?

          <div class="email-content">Oh, God, so that is the way it is.... But if I recall correctly, you  
had certain age categories. The competitors at the lower end of this 
age scale would all be minors. At that point you should have alerted 
them to those problems, so that they knew in advance they wilk nort 
be allowed to book a room in any hotel. Thy should plan someone of 
age to book a room for them. Then they would have knowbn ahead of 
time, and you would never have this discussion.

But as you say, the show must go on. Just ine question I will ask 
for  them. What happens at the border with Canada, if rhey come alone 
and their passport shows they are not of age? Will they be allowed to 
enter Canada? Their parents might not be able to accpmpany them, for 
whatever reasons.

This is a fully open event. The Organization team is not responsible 
for anything outside of the actual event itself...

We went out of way and setup hotels and things here and there..

It is the sole responsibility for any said competitor regardless of 
their age or status to see through any roadblocks that may arise...

This includes border crossings: A: how can the Organization team be 
responsibly for getting people into Canada....answer: there is no 
such way. All we can do is &quot;alert&quot; canada customs of the fact that 
their is a world rubiks event where foriegn competitors are 
coming....we have done this and are jobs are done with respect to 
border crossings...

Hotels: a: we went out of our way to make sure their were siutable 
accomodations available  for everyone close to the venue...

We have done this and our jobs are once again DONE!!!

The new rubikschamps web site clearly states that it is the sole 
responsiblity for you to get here.

The problem people are having with respect to legal age of majority 
is not our problem what so ever nor can we do anything about it. We 
do not set the laws here in Canada so please do not try to put the 
blame of the people setting this event up. How can you all try to 
hold us accountable for hotels??

We do not run hotels. Nor do we write the Laws.

There is an easy way out of this problem which was identified 
earlier.

Start talking to the other folks registered and get it resolved!!..

to say im not putting the blame on the organizers of the 
competition. I just wanted everybody to know about the age limits 
and to see what, if anything Dan G could do about it for us.  

Im sure I can get things worked out so I&#x27;ll have a place to stay. 
Either by staying with someone of age, or having my dad go to 
toronto with me.

Dan G, i think you guys have done an excellent job getting this 
competition set up with all the sponsors and everything.

Don&#x27;t mail yourself.  That is very expensive and incredibly uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions you are probably best off phoning your nearest <br>
canadian embassy (you can find this from the link below).  There are people <br>
on this email group who probably have the right answers to your questions, <br>
but I reckon you are best off getting your answers from a more official <br>
source.  That way you will know for sure that everything is OK.  If you are <br>
a minor travelling without your parents or guardian you will probably need <br>
something to help you get into the country (a letter or something).  I could <br>
be wrong, but probably not: contact the embassy and find out.  If you feel <br>
unsure about doing that then ask your folks / guardians to do so for you.<br>
<br>
There is an official site for these sorts of questions here:<br>
http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/<br>

Forgive my late reply to this, but I was on vacation for a while...<br>
<br>
If we have a painted cube, can we put stickers over the paint, or <br>
must we get a new cube?  I know you said a while ago that tiled cubes <br>
could have stickers over tiles, but what about putting stickers over <br>
paint?<br>

          <div class="email-content">i will answer your question:

1-YES 

2-birth card and drivers license and any pice of picture id you have 
will get in across the border....it will also help if you can bring 
along something to provide your going to Toronto ie a page printout 
of the World Rubiks event....

I dont recommend crossing the corss without a vaild passport with 
all the problems in the world..

therefore i have answered your question but please take care and 
excercise some proper judgement...

ps-it takes 3 days to get a passport here in canada....you have 29 
days left...to get yourself one and avoid any potential border 
problems...

we would like you to come and not in handcuffs.....

heres a site i found with imformation about getting into canada...

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/index.html

looks like you just gotta have a passport, or some other way to 
prove who you are(picture ID)...

heres something about minors getting into canada...i got it from the 
same site...

&quot;Children under the age of 16 should bring identification showing 
who they are. Bring a letter from the parent of a minor child you 
are travelling with, if you are not the child&#x27;s parent or guardian. 
If you are coming with your child and are the only guardian, bring 
documentation showing the child has no other guardians. For example: 
a birth certificate that does not identify the father.&quot;

          <div class="email-content">All,
I&#x27;m coming from the US and was expecting to be able to travel with just my
driver&#x27;s license or other ID but not a passport.  However I recently checked
with a friend of mine who travels to Canada and he said I definitely should
have a passport.  I called the airline and they concurred.  If you&#x27;re
driving it&#x27;s possible you can get in without one, but if you&#x27;re flying,
forget it.  And even if you are driving, it&#x27;s probably not worth the risk
that you&#x27;ll get turned away.  You can get a rush on a passport for an
additional $60, which would get the application processed within a week or
so.  If you also make sure to overnight the application, you should be fine.

Regarding the issue of 18-year-olds checking into the Crowne Plaza--in
America it&#x27;s hard to rent a car if you&#x27;re under 25 years old, unless you
have a major credit card.  Has anyone checked whether having a major credit
card allows one to sidestep the hotel check-in problem too?

          <div class="email-content">I just thought I&#x27;d make an attempt at closing this
chain that I started...From what I gathered...

1.  Don&#x27;t mail yourself to Canada.
2.  If you&#x27;re flying, you NEED a passport.
3.  If you are driving you should still have a
passport.  
   >If you don&#x27;t have a passport have your driver&#x27;s
license, birth certificate, etc.  Whatever forms of
identification you can get.
4.  If you are underaged crossing the border without a
parent or guardian, get some form of written consent
from your parent/guardian.
   >It&#x27;s not a bad idea if you&#x27;re driving to bring a
RWC flyer, as sort of a proof that&#x27;s where you are
going.
5. Common sense too people...no drugs, no toilets, and
no small furry animals are to be taken across the
border. :P  

So yeah...that should just about cover it.  

P.S.  Does anyone know off hand when check-in is at
the Crowne hotel?  If no one knows I will call
tommorow.  Thnx all.

<br>
I&#x27;m looking for a speed edges first method. Ok, I know it&#x27;s not very <br>
used, but there&#x27;s perhaps some interesting methods to try.<br>
If you have ideas or links for me (I know the Philip <br>
Marshall &quot;ultimate&quot; pages), I&#x27;m interested.<br>
<br>
In fact, the problem is in the second part of the resolution. <br>
Placing the edges is very quick, but after that I don&#x27;t know what to <br>
do to place quickly the corners. Looking for, then placing corners <br>
with a 3-cube permutation isn&#x27;t fast enough.<br>
<br>
Ideas ?<br>

You can go to the State Department web site at www.state.gov and download an
application (there is one for a new passport and one for renewing) or look
up the closest passport center where you can apply in person.  Then go to
Kinkos (or somewhere... I was looking for convenience because I had dragged
my feet) to get your photos taken.  Mail or bring the application along with
a check for the regular fee and rush fee, and overnight mail fee if you
think you&#x27;re cutting it close, to a processing center.  There&#x27;s plenty of
info on the site.

Actually I&#x27;d start by calling your airline and confirming they will be
insisting on a passport.

<br>
you need a passport when traveling to a foreign country.<br>
<br>
Canada is a friendly neighbor to the north, but still a foreign <br>
country, with its own government and its own laws. It is not the 51st <br>
state of the Unted States. Therefore you need a passport to travel to <br>
Canada and Canadians need a passport to travel the US.<br>
<br>
Canada does not require a visa of the US citizens, otherwise we all <br>
would need to get one.<br>
<br>
Time is running  out. Only 26 days till the WC2003, counting today. <br>
So if you want to go to the Championships in Toronto, turns off your <br>

I can&#x27;t solve the cube in 20 seconds. Do you think a picture of 
Vasarely or Landry Staircase would do? :-)

Sorry, I have done nothing about my step 3 description - I know it is<br>
currently a bit difficult to understand. You just have to figure it out<br>
yourself, for the moment.<br>
<br>
My next goal is to put my algorithms for step 1 online. These are<br>
algorithms for building a square consisting of a corner, two edges and a<br>
centre piece. Step 1 consists of building 3 squares. Unlike the standard<br>
F2L system which involves building 4 corner/edge pairs, it is<br>
practically impossible to memorise algorithms for every arrangement of<br>
the 3 independent pieces that contribute to the square. Instead, you<br>
need to come up with a solution as you&#x27;re solving the cube. However,<br>
there are a few short algorithms that are useful to know, enabling you<br>
to think in terms of macros (not figure trick macros, but solution<br>
macros).<br>

          <div class="email-content">here is cool tip for people who like fussing with the center screws <br>
on the cube, but find it annoying to glue and break the center caps <br>
to access the screws.  the solution i use is neodymium magnets <br>
(super high strength magnets) to hold the center caps on.<br>
<br>
basicly i bought a bunch of neodymium disk magnets (5mm diameter, <br>
2.5mm thick) from an online retailer (see note at end).  they cost <br>
$0.60 each-- pretty cheap.  then i bought a bunch of small steel <br>
machine nuts (3mm) from my local hardware store.<br>
<br>
1.  super-glue a steel 3mm nut to the inside of each center cap<br>
2.  set a neodymium disk magnet on each steel 3mm nut<br>
3.  put the center caps on<br>
<br>
the neodymium magnet is attracted to both the 3mm nut and the center <br>
screw, thus holding the center cap on.  works great-- my center caps <br>
have never fallen off and when i want to access the screw, i just <br>
pop an edge cubie and pull off the center cap.  when the cube wears <br>
out, you just buy another set of 3mm nuts and glue them to the <br>
center caps of the new cube, and you can re-use the same neodymium <br>
magnets.<br>
<br>
you must be careful with neodymium magnets, since the attraction is <br>
so strong that they can shatter if allowed to come together <br>
uncontrolled.<br>
<br>
to buy neodymium mangets, i used the following retailer:<br>
http://www.indigo.com/magnets/neodymium-magnets.html<br>
and purchased several of part number 43512A.  i wouldn&#x27;t use <br>
anything but a neodymium magnet-- ferrite magnets won&#x27;t be strong <br>
enough and your center caps are liable to fall off.<br>

on stage in front of the incoming junior class to my high school, as 
well as their parents, (a little over 1000 people) and I was of 
course so nervous that my hands were shaking badly.  I intentionally 
slowed down a lot during the entire solve, however since I was so 
nervous and &quot;adrenalined up&quot; my &quot;slow&quot; solve was actually still 
pretty fast.  Anyway by going what I felt was a lot slower I still 
pulled off what I considered to be a really fast time.  So if you&#x27;re 
nervous, slow down and the adrenaline will make up for your seemingly 
slower speed.

my two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Hana,

   It is easy for me to comprehend someone not expecting to need a
passport to go between the US and Canada. It was that way for a couple
hundred years.

   Times change. In the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s I used to visit Canada quite a
bit. In 1969 I flew into Toronto with no ID at all, and was allowed in
no problem.

   I don&#x27;t know when passports became a requirement.

          <div class="email-content">any psychologist will tell you the key is to visualize yourself 
actually performing every time you solve, even in your living room.  
don&#x27;t just sit there and solve.  you have to convince your mind 
before every solve that you are on stage and people are watching.  
they only way to do this is to practice visualizing.  imagine the 
stage, imagine the timer, imagine the people-- you have to see it 
all in your head.  then solve the cube.  rinse and repeat.

do not become complacent and just solve over and over.  visualize 
every time.  you must convince your unconcious mind that you are 
there.  it is hard to do, but it can be done and it will take 
practice to visualize effectively.

i guarantee if you put effort into this procedure a hundred times a 
day between now and wc2003, you&#x27;ll be a lot less nervous than you 
would have been otherwise.

That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m after - hadn&#x27;t realized the conjugation was 
so short - except I&#x27;m cycling on the up face so I&#x27;ll need to start

F&#x27;U&#x27;F and finish F&#x27;UF (though I can cancel out the F of F&#x27;U&#x27;F with 
the initial F&#x27; of F&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;ULFSLUL&#x27;U&#x27;S&#x27;).
I can&#x27;t really mess with the corners since hopefully by the time I 
get to the edges the corners will be solved (or the other way around 
in which case I still don&#x27;t want my corners messed up). So far, I 
haven&#x27;t quite got the corners done (best is all oriented and 17 
placed - so I got them done in 2 looks) but I think I shall soon and 
then this move will be of great use in getting the edges done.

My other problem is to find an alphabet with 30 characters 
(Cambodian has over 90 but I don&#x27;t know it) so I can label the edges 
more efficiently. (The other possibility is Greek and Latin to give 
50 letters, but there&#x27;d be some overlap which is not ideal.)

I&#x27;m reposting my questions from message 5616 because you seem to have <br>
ignored/overlooked them in your responses.  See below for my original <br>
message.  The real question is, are the restrictions for puzzle brand <br>
and color scheme and the &quot;new sticker&quot; requirement only limitations <br>
for the 3x3x3 event or all events?<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
&gt;From Message 5616&lt;<br>
-------------------<br>
&gt; danG-Only Rubiks brand products are permitted!!..<br>
<br>
This is only true of the 3x3x3 competition, correct? What about <br>
stickers vs. tiles vs. painted - 3x3x3 only, again? What if our <br>
larger cubes (4x4x4/5x5x5) are getting a little worn out? Can we <br>
still use them as is? I don&#x27;t know of any way to get replacement <br>
stickers for my cubes (not rubik&#x27;s variety or size), and aside from <br>
that it would take me forever to resticker the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
&gt; I heard that we ARE allowed our own color scheme.<br>
&gt; danG-where have you been man !! WRONG!!! ONLY RUBIKS PRODUCED COLOR <br>
&gt; SCHEMES PERMITTED!!<br>
<br>
I must have been wherever he was, because I had the same <br>
understanding about color schemes. I guess that goes along with my <br>
not hearing that only Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes were allowed. Again, is <br>
this only with the 3x3x3 cubes? My larger cubes are red opposite <br>
purple (made by EastSheen) - can I use these?<br>

i would not have guessed that because this change creates less of an 
impact/advantage than modifying your cube by sanding off plastic 
burrs.  and this has no impact on the sponsors showing off pretty 
cubes with new stickers...

is someone going to try and take off everyone&#x27;s center caps to see 
if there&#x27;s a magnet holding them on instead of glue?  does someone 
actually think that a magneticly attached center-cap offers a 
competitive advantage over a glue-attached center-cap?  or is this 
more a matter that everyone must follow the letter of the law &quot;thou 
shalt not modify thy cube&quot;

although i&#x27;m not seriously competitive (35-40 secs), i am registered 
to come to wc2003, so i guess i&#x27;m glad i haven&#x27;t done this to all my 
cubes yet!  if that is the rule then of course i will abide by it, 
but i must say that i never cease to be amazed at how far out the 
window common-sense goes once rules get involved.

I called Delta Air Lines today, all my flights are with them.  I 
asked them if i needed a passport to fly to Toronto Canada, and they 
told me I didnt need it! :D....they said a drivers license and birth 
certificate would be enough.

p.s. i guess thats why they call the US/Canada border an &quot;open

You should probably make this request through the WC web site.  Just because
Dan participates in this group doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an official channel for
communicating with the organizing committee.  Also, Dan may not oversee
registration; it may be someone else&#x27;s area.

Boy, I hope that won&#x27;t happen... I already have a valid passport, so
I&#x27;m OK with that, but Dan, you haven&#x27;t answered my question yet.

Oh, and could you change my nationality to Japan?

          <div class="email-content">The following page shows how to get a US passport in 2 weeks.
http://travel.state.gov/passport_expedite.html
The costs are as follows:
Regular fee - $55
First time applications - additional $35
Expedited service - additional $60
Including charge to overnight the passport back - around $10
Plus the costs to overnight the application to the state dept, and the cost
of passport photos.  However the upside of all this is you&#x27;ll have your
passport by mid-August.

Do  this SOON! It will take a while ro go through tne procdures. I
don&#x27;t know how long, but better be safe than sorry. Even if the
airline lets you through  you will need a passport to register at the
htel. In fact, you  should not travel to a foreign country without it.

How can anyone book a plane ticket to Toronto, Ontario, CANADA
witgout a valid passport ready is totally beyond my comprehension.

          <div class="email-content">yes most modern cubes are held on by a rivet or something and are 
not very adjustable.  studio cubes have a screw, plus the plastic is 
nice and soft so they break in quick and take lubricant well.

also, the original 1980 ideal/arxon cubes that were made hungary 
have a screw.  not sure about other 1980 ideal cubes that were made 
in taiwan.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
I got your message. Thanks again!<br>
But I got a lot more questions now. I know, after reading <br>
these, you&#x27;re gonna say, &quot;Where were you man?&quot; OK, I was in Reno then <br>
this camp place, and haven&#x27;t been checking out much about WC, so <br>
please bear with me. This is what was said in the rule section of <br>
www.rubikschamps.com as the rule for 3x3x3 blindfold.<br>
<br>
 Rules: Competitor will qualify to compete in future rounds through <br>
time trials based on overall placement against other competitors and <br>
average fastest time over 10 consecutively repeated attempts. Each <br>
round thereafter will use the best average of 5 consecutive attempts <br>
for further advancement. Final round competitors will be chosen based <br>
on age group and total number of competitors.<br>
<br>
Q&#x27;s: So we do 10 consecutive solves and take the average? I mean, <br>
that&#x27;s really intense. What if we mess up on one? Is it going to be <br>
like, that&#x27;s it, or do we get a another trial? If so, up to how many <br>
times can we mess up? And does the middle 10 out of 12 rule apply <br>
here, too? Why don&#x27;t we try like middle 3 out of 5 instead of 10 like <br>
in  Clock, Magic, etc. I don&#x27;t think it really makes sense that <br>
something that takes much concentration to do (at least for me) <br>
requires to be done more times than those that takes less (at least <br>
for me). Is the rules even right? If not, what&#x27;s the correct one?<br>
<br>
Sorry for rambling on and on and on...<br>
It&#x27;s just that the phrase &quot;10 consecutively repeated attempts&quot; <br>
freaked me out.<br>
<br>
Thanks, and again, any kind of answer is appreciated<br>

early Ideal/Made-in-Taiwan cubes appear to have been made from
identical molds, which means the cap over the screw can be hard to get
off! With the other Ideal cubes it is easier to access the screw, with
the Deluxe being the easiest, the screw being under the tile.
   The Ideal cubes made in England, in the cardboard cylinder, have a
good feel to them, as do the ones made in Hungary in the clear plastic
cylinder. I&#x27;m told that the Hong Kong version is also good. Several US
models are cool, too, like the one with the circular Rubiks Logo. All
of these have screws.

          <div class="email-content">Ron I find your last record amazing, congratulations.<br>
<br>
David Wesley is unofficially faster than you, so why do I find your <br>
record amazing? Because after a baaaad 21 seconds (discarded, <br>
fortunately), you got a baaad 20 seconds, and this one is NOT <br>
discarded. <br>
<br>
It&#x27;s really really impressive to get a 16.3 average with a 20.5 in <br>
the list of the 10 times. When going for 16-17seconds average, even <br>
a 18 seconds slows you down A LOT.<br>
<br>
In general, when I get two bad times (= 18-19seconds or above) in an <br>
average, I immediately stop, and start a new one. Obviously I <br>
shouldn&#x27;t.<br>
<br>
here are the times Ron got, <br>
(12) 15 17 15 16 14 (21) 15 20 14 18 14 =&gt; 15.8 + 0.5<br>
try to replace the 20 seconds time with a normal time, let&#x27;s say 16 <br>
or even 17, and then calculate the time Ron would have got...<br>

If the response is given in inches, you can easily convert to meters 
by using this conversion factor.

As I understand, one cm is always one cm, but one inch could be anything.
But 12 inches is always one foot.
Correct?

  1 inch = 2.54 cm - 0.0254 meters
  If the response is given in inches, you can easily convert to meters 
  by using this conversion factor.

80&#x27;s&quot; (1981 I think) that focuses on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. I have heard <br>
people telling me I need to see it, but have always missed it or saw <br>
the wrong year.<br>
<br>
Also, I doubt anybody will have experienced this, but if anybody ever <br>
plays EA Sports&#x27; NHL 2003 for PS2, one announcer randomly says <br>
something like, &quot;Hey Jim, I just solved this Rubik&#x27;s Cube!&quot; I heard <br>
this while my friends were playing and I was intensly cubing. We just <br>
paused the game and looked at each other for about a minute before <br>
laughing hysterically.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well  in Eurpe they use the metric system. In America and the UK 
they  use the English system. Centimeter/meter is metric, inch/foot 
is English. 1 foot = 12 inches, and 1 inch =  2.54 cm, and from this 
point you figure it out.

Personally, I prefer the metric system, not because  I was born in 
Europe, but because the conversion factors are just powers of 10 and 
much easier to manipulate with. This is particularly of compound 
dimension such as  dynes (cgs units of force).

          <div class="email-content">About 2 yrs; my rubiks.com cubes peak at about 3 yrs so they last 
much longer. This doesn&#x27;t say anything about their cube-ibility 
though. So maybe I exaggerated, but I prefer to think long-term.

Just spray some silicone into the center of it, it will do wonders.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, the inside is a exactly the same as a normal rubiks.com 2x2.  The 
problem with the homer heads is getting the peices back together.  Even 
though the normal 2x2s are super easy to put back together, i dunno why the 
homer heads are so hard.  Maybe because they aren&#x27;t cubed shaped peices?

   There are two basic ideas behing the rules:

   1. No cheating. If you sand the internal edges of the cubies so
that you can turn one side way earlier than normal - before the prior
turn of an adjacent side is complete - that is not allowed. This is
only fair.

   2. Seven Towns holds the marketing rights to Erno Rubik&#x27;s product.
Mr. Rubik and his marketing partners have lost several million dollars
to counterfeit cubes. So, if you compete in the championship sponsored
by them, then the cube you use has to *be* a genuine cube and *look*
like one. I think this is only reasonable.

I got 54 moves (HTM). Fairly useless, I expect. I used the cube 
applet on the page.

I also came up with this blindfold solution (66 moves HTM) using my 
new method (all pre-worked out algorithms):

L2BF2R2D2F&#x27;R2UF&#x27;U&#x27;B2L2U&#x27;B&#x27;U&#x27;B2U2F2R2F2U&#x27;F2R2F2U2B&#x27;FR&#x27;BF&#x27;R&#x27;U2LB2F2L2UB
2F2D&#x27;LD2L2R&#x27;U&#x27;D2R&#x27;FUF&#x27;RD2R&#x27;FU&#x27;F&#x27;R&#x27;F2U&#x27;F2L2B2L2R2U&#x27;F2

   Graphite works very, very well, however, it doesn&#x27;t stay in the
cube and gets all over your fingers.

a new feature that allows you to scan in the cube with a webcam, then it<br>
generates the solution algorithm.  With 15 second inspection (scanning) I<br>
was able to solve scan, genrate, and solve the cube in 29 seconds (A not bad<br>
time for me, but far from great).  Though scanning took slightly longer than<br>
the 15 seconds.<br>

Seems like he and I have a lot in common...
 cube, blindfold cube, and juggling
It&#x27;s super-amazing though, how he can solve the cube blindfolded in 
30 seconds. I wonder how long it takes him to memorize the cube...

I finally solved the 4x4x4 blindfolded today...
I hope he can&#x27;t do this one so good (because I can&#x27;t)

BTW, do you know if he&#x27;s gonna come to WC?
Oh, wait, he lives in Canada, so he must.
Oh, this is not very good for me...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Let me clarify.
I´ll be standing on something that we may conditionally define as a floor. If it actually is a podium or
anything else is rather irrelevant. And the hight of the podium - 4 or 104 feet - doesn´t matter, I never
turn giddy.
I´m naturally interested in the vertical distance from the floor (from the soles of my feet) to the cube
in the starting moment.
Unclear?

  those whom are tall and short..previsions will be made..

at this point I think it&#x27;s clear that we can&#x27;t just &#x27;show up and cube.&#x27;...but this is understandable.  You and all the other organizers have to be meticulous to keep this competition running and the sponsors happy.

          <div class="email-content">OK then. Just two questions.
Your words: &quot;...and for those whom are small ore tall..previsions will be made&quot;.

It seems to me that this phrase does indicate the existence of some &quot;standard height&quot;.
1. If it does exist, what is it?
2. If it does not exist, how will you make the previsions for those, who are &quot;tall&quot; or &quot;small&quot;?

          <div class="email-content"> Rune, once again, you have yet to identify your height after 
repeated requests so whats the point of this going back and forth if 
your not going to answer....

if a person is 2 feet tall and the podium is 4 feet OF COURSE WE ARE 
GOING TO PROVIDE A STOOL OR SOMETHING TO STAND ON....

same with a person 10 feet tall...we will raise the podium....!!!

these questions are a bit repeatitive folks when you dont get right 
to the point.....

there are other folks assigned to these types of questions on the 
web site. can we please utilize those people please. I dont have 
time to answer every question you all might have which is why the 
purpose of other people on the web site are there for....

do you all honestly think we are going to make people cube when they 
are uncomfortable.....or the podium is to tall or short.....good 
lord!

          <div class="email-content">jacob,

coming from someone who has dropped out.........


My point of this is the way the questions are coming ...

we have created a web site to answer certain types of questions 
which in turn get answered by various RCC members...

this forum and myself are getting the bulk of the questions and i in 
turn have to answer them all..

some of the questions are common sense questions which people should 
be able to answer on their own.....

i dont mind answering questions however when i would like direct 
questions and not which require me to second guess people...which is 
all i have been getting...

thank you

          <div class="email-content">If I understand this question correctly, you are asking for what is 
known as an amortized average for corner permutation that ignores 
edge permutation, edge orientation, and corner orientation, right? 
Ok then, how do you know that it averages &quot;4 moves,&quot; doesn&#x27;t this 
number answer your question? There are precicly 3 possible cases of 
CP, corners in place, corners swapped adjacently, corners swapped 
diagonally. These three have the weighted probablities (assuming 
uniform random distribution, i.e. no pertinent preprocessing during 
F2L) of 1/6, 2/3, and 1/6 respectively. Another important issue is 
weather you are counting the pre-adjusts or post-adjusts, which for 
practical purposes we may simply add .25 turns to the final result. 
I believe the shortest diagonal swap sequence is of length 6 in Half-
Turn-Metric, 7 for adjacent swap, and of course 0 for corners in 
place (relatively). So it is easy to arrive as the final solution of 
(1/6)(0)+(2/3)(7)+(1/6)(6)+.25 = 11+11/12 turns in HTM. A similar 
calculation may be done for QTM, and for considering other more 
sophisticated scenarios.

I am talking about using a layer by layer approach, like this: cross, <br>
place four first layer corners = first layer completed, OLL, PLL.<br>

In that stage where you just place the first layer corners, on <br>
average you can place each corner correctly in 4 moves each. So now <br>
you have to place all four edges in the middle layer correctly.<br>

It is this part where I was curious about the number of algorithms <br>

simultaneously effectively solving the first two layers.<br>
<br>
If the situations and the algorithms to place all edges were <br>
reasonable (10-12 moves), one could solve the first two layers of the <br>
cube in the same amount of moves as the Fridrich system (which I <br>
currently use for F2L).<br>

          <div class="email-content">It is a very good method. I use it now but I am switching to 
Fridrich because it does have it&#x27;s limits and I want to be faster. 
It&#x27;s quite efficient though and most of the time I can place 2 or 3 
bottom edges at the same time as the top ones. As for learning the 
orient/permute algs, I never bothered because placing the top 
corners completely takes much much longer than orienting them and 
recognition of the bottom corners is not easy. I disagree with you 
about having to look the whole cube over to purmute corners. The 
cube never has to be moved at all using a method described here

heres what i was thinkin at first....


&quot;well there are 8 possible spots each edge could be in...

4 edges...edge can be flipped one of 2 ways...8*4*2=64....but of 
course each edge cannot be in the same spot, so some adjusts will 
have to be made.. oh and you cannot flip a single edge.

hmm..so less than 64&quot;

lol but after thinking about it some more tryin to figure it out 
there is going to be WAY more than 64 possibilities.

this is over my head.
haha

Subject: Corners Method

I checked out your page and I used to use this same method. I learned 
the algs from Ron&#x27;s site to orient/permute the second face corners in 
one alg and after practice it is without a doubt faster than 
permuting the top and bottom corners together. This is because you 
have to look the whole cube over to see which corners are already 
correct.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I understand the question now, I&#x27;m breaking the cases up into 8 
groups: 1 group for each of 0,1,3,4 edges in middle layer plus 4 
groups where 2 edges are in the middle layer (mid edges adj OR diag)X
(LL edges ajd OR opp). This is a really tedious calculation and 
there is realy no way of doing it other then going through almost 
cases by cases for the more sophisticated solution that accounts for 
both diagonal mirroring, vertical miroring, rotational 
isomorphisims, and other wacky isomorphisms. (There is no need to 
account for inverses for the purposes of recognition/speedcubing.) 
The stupid answer would be of course (8*7*6*5)(2^4) but I suppose 
this is not the value you desire. Allowing for a free pre-adjust of 
the LL, I believe the number of &quot;distinct&quot; cases for when all 4 
edges are on mid is 60 (counting the solved one). If all 4 edges are 
on LL there should be 48 cases. No more then 144 for 1 edge in mid, 
3 on LL. Precisely 11 permutation cases for 3 edges in mid, 1 on LL 
(but don&#x27;t multiply that by 16 orientation cases just yet...). There 
rest of the calculations are quite tedious. All together there 
should be at least 100 &quot;distinct&quot; cases, which makes this approach 
quite illogical for a speedsolving method. Recognition itself should 
be a pain.

I believe this question has already been answered (though perhaps 
the 
wording has confused people).

My understanding is that the contestant will be standing on the 
floor 
and, prior to/after solving, the cube will be resting on the 
speedstack timing device, four feet above that same floor on which 
the contestant will stand.

Dan, is this correct?  Please answer yes or no (if no, then explain 
with details to clarify the solving environment).

It is a very good method. I use it now but I am switching to 
Fridrich because it does have it&#x27;s limits and I want to be faster. 
It&#x27;s quite efficient though and most of the time I can place 2 or 3 
bottom edges at the same time as the top ones. As for learning the 
orient/permute algs, I never bothered because placing the top 
corners completely takes much much longer than orienting them and 
recognition of the bottom corners is not easy. I disagree with you 
about having to look the whole cube over to purmute corners. The 
cube never has to be moved at all using a method described here

&gt; &quot;well there are 8 possible spots each edge could be in...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 4 edges...edge can be flipped one of 2 ways...8*4*2=64....but of <br>
&gt; course each edge cannot be in the same spot, so some adjusts will <br>
&gt; have to be made.. oh and you cannot flip a single edge.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; hmm..so less than 64&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, you can have just one flipped, because there are 4 <br>
additional unsolved edges on the cube at that point (LL edges).<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s look at that equation... There are 8 possible spots for each <br>
edge, I believe this would be 8^4 (8 possibilities for edge 1 * 8 <br>
possibilities for edge 2, etc.), not 8*4.  To take into account the <br>
fact that you can&#x27;t have two edges in the same place, however, you <br>
get more of a factorial type of equation.  There are 8 possibilities <br>
for the first edge, but once it&#x27;s placed, there are only 7 <br>
possibilities for edge 2, and so on.  So instead of 8*4 (or 8^4), you <br>
get 8*7*6*5 = 1,680.<br>
<br>
Next, let&#x27;s think about orientation.  If each edge can be flipped one <br>
of two ways, then that would be not just 2, but 2*2*2*2 (a multiple <br>
of 2 for each edge involved).  This would make the upper limit more <br>
like (8*7*6*5)*(2*2*2*2) = 1,680 * 16 = 26,880.<br>
<br>
The actual number of unique situations is quite far from this number, <br>
though, because of all the cases that are identical to each other.  <br>
For example, there are four separate cases in which all edges are <br>
placed properly, but one is flipped (4 choices of which one to flip), <br>
even though these are all solved the same (and therefore are really <br>
just one case).  Also, there are 32 possibilities for having 3 edges <br>
solved, and one edge on the LL (4 choices of which edge to put on the <br>
LL, 4 positions to choose from to put it in, and 2 possible flips = <br>
4*4*2 = 32), even though we all know that if 3 edges are in the <br>
middle layer and the last is in the LL, there are only two <br>
possibilities that matter (orientation).<br>
<br>
Sorry to keep babbling, but I think you get the point.  The number is <br>
no larger than 26,880, but I can gaurantee it&#x27;s not even close to <br>
that limit.  I just don&#x27;t have any good ideas for narrowing it down <br>
any further than that without looking at specific cases.<br>

How about in-darkness cubing? Thd contestant will enter a room, where 
it is pitch dark, nly the glowing cube glows. His aim is, as usual, 
to solve the cube as fast as possible. The cube should be anisotropic 
picture ccube, ssomething like you have. Only those pictures will 
glow, nothing else. The cube should be scrambled outside the dark 
room and handed n a bag to to the contestant. The contestant opens 
the bag, takes auot the cube,m inspeucts it nd starts cubing. When he 
is done, he opens the door and shows the solved cube. Like it, anyne?

I think the whole discussion originates in a semantic misconception. I am convinced that we - for the TV, for the public - will be standing on some kind of a scene, on something that almost everybody but DanG would call a podium. And this scene has of course a floor. Then we have to put down the cube on something that in Canada is called a podium.

&gt; This would make the upper limit more <br>
&gt; like (8*7*6*5)*(2*2*2*2) = 1,680 * 16 = 26,880.<br>
<br>
Correct. <br>
 <br>
&gt; The actual number of unique situations is quite far from this<br>
&gt; number, though, because of all the cases that are identical to<br>
&gt; each other. <br>
<br>
You could rotate the whole cube around its vertical axis, or turn <br>
just the bottom layer. The 26880 figure counts all these cases <br>
separately, i.e. those that differ by a cube turn and/or bottom layer <br>
turn are considered different.<br>
<br>
There are 4x4=16 combinations of cube/D-layer turns. If every case <br>
were non-symmetrical, then the number we had is 16 times too large, <br>
giving only 105 distinct cases. This is a slight underestimate <br>
because there are a few symmetrical cases (cases where a D-layer/cube <br>
turn does not have any effect). Still it won&#x27;t be more than 200 I <br>
think.<br>
<br>
To get the exact number you would have to count them by hand, or <br>
apply Burnside&#x27;s Lemma. See the Maths page on my site if you want <br>
details.<br>

With pleasure. 173.27 cm/2.54 cm per inch = 68.22 unches = 5 feet and 
8.22 inches, rounded off to two decimal places. Therefore, a four-
foot podium leaves 1 foot and 8.22 inches over, which is perfect for 
cubing.

I live in the US but  was born and lived in what is now Czech 
Republic,m so I, too, am familiar with the metric system. Besides, 
physicists rend to prefer the metric system, because of its ease of 
coversion, particularly when units like dynes, newtons, ergs and 
joules (etc) are involved.

          <div class="email-content">the rules *are* a little arbitrary.  the world is not a black and 
white place.  it would be impossible to make a rule that 
disqualifies a cube for a small amount of sanding when the same 
amount of wear could be attributed to normal use.  also, there&#x27;s no 
logic to magneticly-held center-caps being disqualified, but i&#x27;m 
told that they are illegal.  so the rule is: the judge decides if 
your cube is ok based on some rough guidelines that have been laid 
out.

basicly it seems that this is not some kind of olympic sport, and as 
you noted there is no governing committee that oversees standards 
and rules.  you are solving a toy puzzle manufactured by a company 
that decided to try sponsoring a competition so they can get p.r. 
value and sell more toys.  so whatever the company wants is what 
goes.  if they don&#x27;t want to take the time to assemble a governing 
committee and as a result the rules end up being a little arbitrary, 
then that&#x27;s what happens.

in the end, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really going to matter much anyways.  
if someone shows up with a cube that is obviously sanded a lot it 
will be disqualified.  if someone else shows up with a cube that was 
sanded but only enough that it looks like normal wear, it will 
probably not be noticed.  oh well.  if someone pulls at my center 
caps and notices that they&#x27;re held on by a magnet and my cube gets 
disqualified, i&#x27;ll use the cube they provide.  i find it the &quot;rules&quot; 
more humorous than truly impactful.  i&#x27;m not going to worry about 
it.  in the end i just want to be there for the fun and competition 
so i can have the key competitors autograph something that will be 
in my framed shadow-box cube shrine.

The fastest I ever got with it is around 40 seconds but it is easily

I would recommend taking the puzzle apart, but I never did figure out <br>
how to do that with a 4x4x4 without feeling like I was going to break <br>
it.  Their lube is okay, but I would instead recommend a silicone <br>
spray - take the puzzle apart, spray it, let it dry, and then put it <br>
back together.  Some will say not to take it apart, but I think it <br>
works better if you do - it can feel a little sticky if you don&#x27;t.<br>

<br>
Well, I can tell you that the centers break off fairly easily.  To <br>
avoid it, I&#x27;d recommend that you avoid doing slice moves (instead, <br>
move slices with the surrounding face, and then turn the face back).  <br>
That&#x27;s how I broke mine.  They do sell a part replacement kit for $5 <br>
at Rubiks&#x27;s online store ( http://www.rubikshop.com/ ), but that only <br>
gets you 2 center pieces... If you think you&#x27;ll go through a lot, buy <br>
a new 4x4x4 cube for $22, and you get 4 of each color, plus <br>
replacements for the other pieces, in case you lose any.<br>

<br>
<br>
  Let&#x27;s talk about something different (not the WC2003 !)<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;m looking for a speed edges first method. Ok, I know it&#x27;s not very <br>
  used, but there&#x27;s perhaps some interesting methods to try.<br>
  If you have ideas or links for me (I know the Philip <br>
  Marshall &quot;ultimate&quot; pages), I&#x27;m interested.<br>
<br>
  In fact, the problem is in the second part of the resolution. <br>
  Placing the edges is very quick, but after that I don&#x27;t know what to <br>
  do to place quickly the corners. Looking for, then placing corners <br>
  with a 3-cube permutation isn&#x27;t fast enough.<br>
<br>
  Ideas ?<br>

just show up with a good looking cube and your in.......i have power 
over the sponsors however its been a solid fight and i have one 
every battle thus far...

as to sanding....we are referring to the imperfections in the 
plastic.......i can tell wear from molding....


dont worry people...it will all work out....if any sponsor gives you 
grief during cube inspection...come and get me!!!!

          <div class="email-content">you will not see the actual documentaries on said tv station...

documentaries will be shown in film festivals around the world.

we are producing a pro quality video of the event for sale on 
rubiks.com.

we do however have 2 stations interested...discovery and the 
documentary channel....

question to you all....do you get the above 2 channels and from 
which feed ie wktn, wfrn etc..

there will be a scramble provided where you will be givin the 
duration of the day to a: provide us with your solution in alg form 
AND solving form...ie on paper then in demonstration form...

competitors in this event will not be permitted to leave the area 
where the event is being held and you are not permitted to consult 
with any other competitors or means.

fewest moves event is a challenge only with prizes being material 
items versus cash.

contrary to what is on the web site.

Hana, I can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re being serious--probably both--so I don&#x27;t 
know whether to respond to you seriously.  I too was both being 
facetious but also making a serious point.  Important questions 
should go through the web site (as Dan has requested--I think) in 
spite of Dan&#x27;s generosity in keeping up with this group.  One reason 
is that outstanding speedcubers who aren&#x27;t participants in this group 
should have the same access to official WC info as we do--belonging 
this group is not a requirement for speedcubers.  So my point was 
that if Dan got off this group, people would start asking their 
questions through official channels in a hurry!

Amen to that.  I find I need to remind myself to be grateful to the 
event sponsors for making this event happen.  It&#x27;s the first in-
person cube competition I&#x27;ve ever been in, 22 years after starting to 
speed cube, so if they want me to participate floating upside down in 
the air, as Dan has suggested, you can still count me in!

Subject: Re: sanding

the rules *are* a little arbitrary.  the world is not a black and 
white place.  it would be impossible to make a rule that 
disqualifies a cube for a small amount of sanding when the same 
amount of wear could be attributed to normal use.  also, there&#x27;s no 
logic to magneticly-held center-caps being disqualified, but i&#x27;m 
told that they are illegal.  so the rule is: the judge decides if 
your cube is ok based on some rough guidelines that have been laid 
out.

basicly it seems that this is not some kind of olympic sport, and as 
you noted there is no governing committee that oversees standards 
and rules.  you are solving a toy puzzle manufactured by a company 
that decided to try sponsoring a competition so they can get p.r. 
value and sell more toys.  so whatever the company wants is what 
goes.  if they don&#x27;t want to take the time to assemble a governing 
committee and as a result the rules end up being a little arbitrary, 
then that&#x27;s what happens.

in the end, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really going to matter much anyways.  
if someone shows up with a cube that is obviously sanded a lot it 
will be disqualified.  if someone else shows up with a cube that was 
sanded but only enough that it looks like normal wear, it will 
probably not be noticed.  oh well.  if someone pulls at my center 
caps and notices that they&#x27;re held on by a magnet and my cube gets 
disqualified, i&#x27;ll use the cube they provide.  i find it the &quot;rules&quot; 
more humorous than truly impactful.  i&#x27;m not going to worry about 
it.  in the end i just want to be there for the fun and competition 
so i can have the key competitors autograph something that will be 
in my framed shadow-box cube shrine.

I was curious because I also use corners first and have toyed with 
learning the F2L,LL method for the same reason.  I average about 40 
seconds, and my recent best is just under 30 seconds.  In the end I 
decided that I would live by my favored method at the WC and if I 
don&#x27;t go back into my second retirement from the cube after the WC, 
I&#x27;d learn the new method.  Anyway, I&#x27;m trying to figure out whether 
I&#x27;m slower than other people because they&#x27;re better at looking ahead 
and finger tricks, or whether Corners First is intrinsically slower.  
There&#x27;s still more room for improvement for me (e.g, just saw a post 
about doing the position/orient bottom corners in a single 
look/algorithm rather than 2 looks), I think I can get at least 
another 5 seconds, but after that we&#x27;ll see.

If you are at the WC, find me and say hi.  I wouldn&#x27;t pass it up just 
because you&#x27;re slow... how many other times are you going to get to 
participate in an world-class competition for something?

The fastest I ever got with it is around 40 seconds but it is easily 
possible to average under 30-My best unlucky time is 35. If I took 
the time to learn more algs, I could go faster but I&#x27;m switching 
over to a layer system and will persue CF no longer. There is a 99% 
chance I will not be at WC because this is probably the slowest I 
will ever be but you can count on seeing me at the next WC.

Correction, I should use the pst tense, WAS. I juat read that it has 
been changed to CornersFirst group. So where is the official channel 
now?
It was us, not Dan, who forced him to participate in this group. We 
posted our questions here. I admit I am one of the  guilty. I  didn&#x27;t 
start this trend, but fllow in the  footsteps of  others.
All this is history. The WC2003 no longer exists. And of cxourse, Dan 
can be a member of whatever group  he choses tro be.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Adam S and Barefoot Chris,

   I don&#x27;t use the corners first approach, but here and there I try it
and I&#x27;m only a little slower than usual, which is pretty good for
something I don&#x27;t practice. So I would guess that corners first is not
an intrinsically slow method.  

   I think that if I had a good 2x2x2 and learned all the efficient
corner algs that my corners-first time would improve quite a bit. And
there are so many possible way to do the edges...

          <div class="email-content">I solve edge first sometimes when I&#x27;m bored and think there could 
definately be a good speed edge first method. It&#x27;s faster to place 
edges then corners in the 1st layer so why not the whole cube? To 
place corners, you could 1.first move the cubies to the correct top 
or bottom layer with a few algs(+ there are 3 dimensions to choose 
from) 2.orient 1 layer that would have to affect orientation of the 
other. I counted 37 possible situations but I&#x27;m sure that is wrong. 
3. orinet the other layer using 1 of 7 algs. 4. permute all using a 
few algs. step 1 could also come after 2&amp;3. --just an idea. I&#x27;m not 
an expert and it does seem a little lengthy.

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;ll take some time to determinin which layer (top/bottom) a 
corner has to go to. How about:

1. correct orientation of all corners in 1 alg.
2. move all corners to their correct side (top/bottom) in 1 alg.
3. permute all corners to their correct position in 1 alg.
(part of step 3 can be done in step 2)

The whole solving process:

Cross:                   6 moves avg.
F2L Edge (1 pattern):3x4=12
ELL (13 patterns):       8
step 1:                  10? (can someone figure these out?)
step 2:                  10?
step 3:                  10?
Total:                   56?

I&#x27;m not sure about the # of moves for corner algs, but it seems like 
it takes about the same # of moves to solve the whole thing.
The problem with this method is, though, that you need 4 
major &quot;looks&quot;, one before each of the last four alg.

There must be some other ways to do the corners...

          <div class="email-content">Hey all!<br>
   I just restickered one of my cubes that was in pretty bad shape.  <br>
Since the method worked really well, I thought I&#x27;d share.<br>
<br>
I bought 6 colored plastic folders from wal-mart $.49 each, one of <br>
each color (though finding a white proved far more difficult than it <br>
should&#x27;ve been)  I reccomend going right around now since they have <br>
all their back-to-school stuff in heavy stock.  These are the kinds <br>
with 3 holes and 2 pockets but no rings (except for the white one, <br>
which was the only thing I could find in white).  The plastic is <br>
pretty stiff.  I also bought some crazy glue.<br>
<br>
After pulling off all the stickers and cleaning the plastic with <br>
rubbing alcahol, I went into photoshop.  I created a simple grid with <br>
squares measuring about 9/16&quot; square.  fit a total of 8x8 of these <br>
onto a sheet.  This gives you 64 squares, or 10 extra in case you <br>
mess up.  I uploaded this picture to the Files section of this yahoo <br>
group, it is stickertemplate.bmp .<br>
<br>
I printed this sheet out cut the squares into groups of 9, usually in <br>
two connected rows (8 &amp; 1, 7 &amp; 2, 6 &amp; 3, and 5 &amp; 4).  I taped one of <br>
each of these onto the plastic folders, making sure the tape <br>
overlapped by a comfortable margin onto the plastic.  Then it&#x27;s <br>
simply cutting out the stickers along the templates.<br>
<br>
Once your stickers are cut out, just smear a thin layer of superglue <br>
onto the sticker and press onto the blank cube for a few seconds.  <br>
Voila a waterproof nice-looking stickered cube.  <br>
<br>
I did another cube without the template a few weeks ago and the <br>
stickers have yet to show any wear.  And after 2 cubes (and a few <br>
mistakes in cutting the plastic due to trial and error) I&#x27;d say I <br>
still have enough material to cut 20+ cube&#x27;s worth of stickers, at <br>
least.  Total cost: Less than $5.00.<br>
<br>
I also have a template made for the megaminx, but I have yet to try <br>
it out, as it&#x27;s tough to find 12 different colored folders (that <br>
remotely match the scheme I&#x27;m used to).<br>
<br>
Just thought I&#x27;d share! Hope this helps some people out.<br>

But I&#x27;m betting that they&#x27;ll have them now that it&#x27;s back to school

My mom just bought me eight different colored folders, but she 
probably wouldn&#x27;t be happy if I sliced them all up. LOL
Thanks, though, this should help me alot!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m sure a cube done this way will be disqualified from the wc 
though. Those rules are very strict.

Also, it&#x27;s not an original idea, Gilles came up with it a long time 
ago. I don&#x27;t like like it (too permanent), but using the neoprene 
glue he suggests should provide for a semi-permanent solution so you 
won&#x27;t have to scratch the plastic when/if razoring them off.

Originally I was told the positive effects of having a studio cube, <br>
but I&#x27;ve only encountered horrific effects, which again, is probably <br>
just my fault.  I&#x27;m sure everyone else&#x27;s studio cube makes them feel <br>
like a genuine cuber.  Since I got my studio cube to replace my <br>
worse speedcube, the following has happend:<br>
<br>
My avg has gone from a consistent sub 34, to a fight to be sub40.  <br>
<br>
I avg one piece coming out of my cube per solve.  This is because <br>
when I do pop, it is a super mega ultron pop, like a super hero <br>
pop.  On one occasion my cube ended up scattered in 30 different <br>
pieces across my room, something i didn&#x27;t think possible.<br>
<br>
And when i first got my studio cube, in the process of getting off a <br>
center cap i stabbed myself, bled all over my favorite shorts, and <br>
ruined the center cap.  Oh yeh, the knife hit the bone, that always <br>
feels good.  But once again, this is because of my excessive <br>
stupidity.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s ok though cuz i found an old speedcube which I will be using <br>
for the RWC.  I sanded the paint off of that beast, and now it&#x27;s <br>
ready for some sticker action.  If you are still reading this I <br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, that sounds bad. The best advice I can give you is to tighten 
the screws some more. Do it until they are too tight, so it won&#x27;t 
pop, then loosen it a bit.
But you might want to wear safety gloves, or something. Just in case.

          <div class="email-content">I pity a person that would rather have have a program do their cube 
for them then to try the challenge themselves. Why else would you 
have bought the cube in the first place? Especially if you can solve 
the 3x3, the 4x4 could be solved by doing corners (no algs), paring 
edges (do algs, except for a little trick on the last two), solving 
as a 3x3, and then, maybe then coming to the fourm asking about the 
whole parity problem, which btw could anyone out there help me on an 
issue.

I often end up on both types of parity issues (single edge flip AND 
two-edge swap), I know the optimal or near optimal methods for 
solving each individually, however is there a compound one for 
solving both symutaneously (or such that afterwards it can now be 
solved like a 3x3, hopefully only LL is altered), Hardwick or 
Akimoto might be able to offer a solution to this problem.

So anyways, I suggests attempting it for yourself, and I kinda like 
that there isn&#x27;t a program out there that can solve the 4x4 (that I 
know of), it makes attempts at it seem less trivial. Learn to be 
good enough (or understand it well enough) to write a program/applet 
that will do the 4x4!

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t mean &#x27;temporary&#x27; in that it should fall off in a month. It 
just seems more flexible if it would be easy to take the plastic 
squares off when and if one wants/needs to. It&#x27;s in the same logic 
that I wouldn&#x27;t use a whole perimeter of superglue on the center 
caps, opting for just a small drop applied with the end of a needle. 

Also I don&#x27;t intend on any of my main cubes breaking (unless sombody 
does something stupid like toss it out of a moving vehicle), I hope 
they last forever. (I add more cubes into the rotation so that newer 
cubes are used much more often then the older ones, which I 
eventually retire.) So I&#x27;d rather go for the not-as-permanent 
solution incase of an unforeseeable need..., say 10 yrs in the 
future. (For example, I once needed to prepare a minimally stickered 
cube to challenge another cubist.)

A very strong glue would have been better in my opinion, but superglue
just didn&#x27;t work at all with the PVC film I found. I had inexpensive
neoprene glue in my toolcase, so I tried it and was satisfied with the
result. An advantage is you can&#x27;t ruin your cube if glue is in excess.
Just rub your finger over it after.
But now, at last, I&#x27;ve found perfect self-adhesive vinyl film :-)

I just like ideas to get the proper credit, or more-proper as the

the Fridrich F2L step). Although I&#x27;m sure people here may appriciate

Thanks a lot, this is a very terrific offer. It&#x27;d be nice not to 
have to feel like one&#x27;s trying to cheat the system. In my opinion, 
only other fellow cubists can truly tell/judge whether another one 
is &#x27;cheating.&#x27; Perhaps all the rules were intentionally left vauge 
since it will be blantantly obvious if we see that someone is trying 
to pull a quick one.

Although it doesn&#x27;t apply to me (again with crossing DanG&#x27;s direct 
questioning law), I am curious as to why a cube modified with 
magnets to hold the center caps would be in violation of the wc 
policy. Especially since it can&#x27;t be seen by the camera. It&#x27;s just a 
way to stick the center caps on (you&#x27;d see if a cheating cubist is 
swapping center caps while cubing). What&#x27;s next, regulating the 
type&amp;amount of glue people have to use to attach their center caps? 
(Like it has to be the same brand/consistancy as what the 
manufacturer (Hessport or else!!) applied...) Or is it that adding 
magnets, actaully changes the overall weight/inertia of the cube? 
Then all professional bowlers must use the same wieght bowling ball 
in official competitions...??? I know, I know..., again with 
comparing something that is a game/propriatory-toy/puzzle with an 
olympic sport...

Actually I heard somewhere (well many places) that Erno&#x27;s patent 
will expire soon (like less then 10 years), since patents don&#x27;t last 
forever. Besides, competition is great for consumers! Hessport/Seven-
Towns has a monopoly over the cube (currently for good reason of 
course), this is around the time many people say &quot;Microsoft is 
Evil.&quot; If the cube was produced by many companies, we cubists would 
have access to better quality cubes. It IS nice that rubiks.com 
finally came out with longer-lasting stickers after an era of crudy 
ones. Erno&#x27;s patent/copyrights can&#x27;t last forever. Nothing against 
the man of course, he&#x27;s BRILLIANT for creating this devil, but don&#x27;t 
feel sorry for him either (be it suffered heafty losses due to all 
the generic clones that floated around) - he&#x27;s no doubt quite 
wealthy.

I think i cut myself atleast 3 times when i was trying to get the 
center caps off my studio cube.  and yeah i ended up ruining one of 
the caps too, I just stole a cap off an old worn out cube.  Them 
things are glued on there pretty good huh!.....i hope i never have 
to take mine off again....i superglued them all back on
lol
...once you adjust the screws right it should stop poping.

i feel your pain

Hypothetically speaking; suppose one of your screws
loosens so much a whole center piece comes off. 
You&#x27;re going to be cutting yourself a lot more trying
to get that cap off again.  

But yeh, those things do come glued super tight.  It&#x27;d
be nice if they could send the cube to you without the
caps glued or even on at all.  A friend of mine also
cut himself getting a cap off of his studio cube. 
Those things should come with a warning.  Or at least
directions for those who don&#x27;t know how to stop the
bleeding.

          <div class="email-content">Oh, I have heard of all sorts of horror stories about accidentally 
getting cut when removing center caps, some much worst then what you 
talk about (admittedly hiting bone is fairly severe). Some one said 
they took off a significant chunk of skin doing this. Personally, 
I&#x27;ve never had any such problem, and, believe me, I have done a lot 
of this type of stuff. (Taking the center tiles off the center caps 
is one of the worst..., oh wait this is almost never neccessary, for 
some reason I remember vaguely doing this a few yrs ago.) I think 
the worst I&#x27;ve done is split open a tile.

Anyways, my suggestions (from a few years of experience and having 
re-schemed 2 Mefferts cubes) are to:

a) Use a very sharp knife, preferably a razor blade for it&#x27;s 
thinness (but strong enough not to break, because that could cause a 
much worst injury)

b) Were some sort of eye protection: googles or glasses. Definately 
no gloves, direct finger contact gives better control/friction. I 
use my lap for stablizing so I put on thick jeans incase.

c) Always, and I mean ALWAYS, direct force away from you (and make 
sure no one is in the vacinity to prvent from being sued...)

d) Gradually, very gradually increase the force applied (set a 
limit, never go over that limit, up the limit after finding it 
futile but go at it from different directions first)

e) Go at it from different directions before increasing the force 
(for center caps, know how deep the surfacee is before hitting the 
mortise - both in parallel and from the 45 deg angle, going from the 
corners of the caps seem to work well)

f) Use a non-sharp, but preferably thin object to pry the cap or 
tile out once you make enough room (this way you can use a lot more 
pressure then doing so with a dangerous knife or razorblade) do this 
using the leverage but be careful not to damage the cap or the rest 
of the center piece (or tile as the case may be) (prying from the 
corner of a cap seem to give good results)

g) Move on to another one if your stuck, some of these suckers are 
rediculously well bonded/melted/sub-atomically-binded together (ok, 
a bit of an exaggeration)

h) Employ chemical means before resorting to excessive force: dip it 
in industrial strength nail-polish remover, expose it to excessive 
temperature changes (in the frezzer then oven, and vice-versa), 
knock it with a hammer a few times gently, etc.

i) Fingers are so important for speedcubing, don&#x27;t lose precious 
dexterity and suffer the pain of getting cut!

HAPPY CUBING!!! (I&#x27;m sure many of you will find this a bit 
silly/excessive, but this is what sets us apart... goes with the 
very definition of a fanatic.)

Waterman&#x27;s method is not &quot;corners first&quot;, he begins with L side (or at
least 8 pieces of it).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug, <br>
<br>
Are you asking me about combined parity problem solutions?<br>
Sorry I don&#x27;t have optimized algorithms either. <br>
I think you may not be comfortable with the center first method <br>
because you need 3 alorithms to solve in the most weird case: two <br>
adjuscent pairs are swapped and one edge pair is flipped. <br>
<br>
You need 3 rotations like 3x3 (7), Chris&#x27;s two edge pairs swap (7), <br>
and permute one edge pair flip (15). Total slice moves is 29. <br>
<br>
With my solution, I don&#x27;t care edges are paired or not, because I <br>
solve one edge by one. <br>
I do 3 edge rotation (12)(not edge pairs!), and permute two edges <br>
swap (21). I have four choices for the first 3 edges rotation but all <br>
are basically identical to me. My case is 33. <br>
<br>
In case two non-adjuscent pairs are swapped and one pair is flipped. <br>
You may want to do Chris&#x27;s two edges pairs swap (7) and one edge pair <br>
flip (15). <br>
This is the shortest with unoptimized method (22). <br>
But I do two edges swap in same slice (17) and 3 edges rotation (10). <br>
(total=27)<br>
As you know the total move count does not often correlate to the <br>
time. <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how many people use the solution like me. <br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s definitely worth giving it a go yourself first. Once you get 
into it, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s not much more difficult than the 
3x3x3. You should be able to use all your 3x3x3 algs, and you only 
need a few more 4x4x4-specific algs and you&#x27;re done!

When I first bought a 4x4x4, I too was tempted to look up a 
solution. But I resisted because I knew it would be so much more 
satisfying to get there myself. I spent about 4-5 days going as far 
as I could, but then got stuck by the edge parity issue in the LL. 
This is where I looked up the answer (I looked at Chris H&#x27;s LL 
Revenge solution). I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with myself that I didn&#x27;t 
do the whole thing on my own, but I&#x27;m happy that I did *most* of it 
without looking up algs. :)

BTW, same goes for the 5x5x5. If you get one of those, you&#x27;ll be 
able to use all your 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 knowledge to solve it. In fact, 
I pretty much just use intuition + 3x3x3 + 4x4x4 algs to solve the 
5x5x5. I&#x27;m sure there are 5x5x5-specific algs for faster solves, but 
I think it can be done with just 3x3x3 + 4x4x4 algs (adapted for the 
larger cube of course though).

Oh, don&#x27;t pity us... Some of us are just wired differently.  While we <br>
may want to be able to solve the puzzle (thus the reason for buying <br>
it), we don&#x27;t necessarily want, or have the ability or time, to solve <br>
it on our own.  Some of us simply don&#x27;t enjoy the &quot;challenge&quot; (a.k.a. <br>
the &quot;frustration&quot;) of trying to figure out a puzzle on our own. The <br>
only puzzle that I&#x27;ve figured out on my own so far is the pyraminx <br>
(well... Perhaps the 2x2x2, if that counts after knowing the 3x3x3).  <br>
Even once I knew how to solve a 4x4x4, I couldn&#x27;t figure out a 5x5x5 <br>
for the life of me.  I guess perhaps I&#x27;m just a bit thick skulled.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Richard,

   You are not alone with your troubles with the studio cube.

   The first one i got was adjusted so tightly that it&#x27;s not only hard
to turn, but impossible to to take apart; so I can&#x27;t even get at the
center caps to try to adjust it.

   The second one I got had been made into a speedcube. when I told
the person who made me the cube that it popped all the time he was
really nice about it, but I don&#x27;t think  believed me.

   But this popping is a well-known problem, and the manufacturer just
fixed it. Many of the older cubes are flat under the center cap which
allows the edge cubies to derail, but Seven Towns has gone back to the
original patent. The newest genuine cubes, which may not be in the
stores near you yet, have the little arches underneath the center caps
which prevent that derailing.

   So even though they don&#x27;t have the adjustable screws they might be
workable as speedcubes.
   Now if they just sold the centers to use on our older cubes...

          <div class="email-content">Though I wasn&#x27;t able to solve the revenge on my own originally, I did <br>
come up with my own algs for the two parity problems.  Unfortunately, <br>
neither of them was overly optimal, and the alg I used to fix one <br>
actually fixed both (or caused the other if it wasn&#x27;t present).<br>
<br>
For the sake of fixing both parity problems on the 4x4x4, try this <br>
(lower case means just the slice next to the face in this instance):<br>
d (F2 d&#x27; F2 d) (R2 d&#x27; R2 d) (L2 d L2 d&#x27;) (L2 d2 u2 L2 d2 u2)<br>
<br>
This sequence flips the FR edge pair and swaps it with the FL edge <br>
pair.  This is only 19 slice moves, as compared to Masayuki&#x27;s 22.  <br>
You&#x27;ll notice that the edges and centers are all matched up again <br>
before the last set of 6 moves, but the edges are all out of <br>
position.  The last 6 moves put things in place.<br>

brain for some positive attributes of having a cube
that pops too much.  I will most likely not be using
my studio cube for RWC, which I believe I&#x27;ve posted
allready, but I think that the studio cube (even with
its immense pops) is good practice.  Playing around
with my studio cube so much has forced me to execute
algorithms more exactly.  It&#x27;s hard to explain but
praciticing with a &quot;bad&quot; cube may very well be a good
thing.  You fly that much faster when you get a cube
that doesn&#x27;t pop.  Almost comparable would be when you
put your hands in cold water, then immediately put
them in warm water, the temperature seems higher.  I
think now I&#x27;m just rambling on.  I&#x27;ve seen the
eastsheen 2x2, 4x4, 5x5...they all are extremely
resistent to popping...eastsheen should get together
with rubiks and figure out a super cube.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Grant... so I don&#x27;t fall into the &quot;purist&quot; category.  
Many disciplines--science, sports--move forward not because each new 
innovator recreates the wheel from scratch, but because they take 
full advantage of what&#x27;s already been discovered, and then innovate 
from there.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with trying to solve the 
cube on one&#x27;s own as well... I think both approaches offer their own 
challenges and rewards.

The WC committee doesn&#x27;t have a formal relationship with, nor does it 
mention in its materials, any Yahoo discussion groups.  Dan answers 
questions here simply because he wants to.  My understanding is that 
the WC committee officially dispenses information and answers 
questions through the web site and the phone numbers listed on the 
web site.  Having said that though, I&#x27;m glad to have the quick 
response we get from Dan here.

Speaking of which, I&#x27;m going to ask on the WC web site, but I&#x27;ll also 
ask here: should we expect to get anything in the mail about our 
entry into the competition?  All I&#x27;ve got is the email reply to the 
form I filled out online.

No ! I solve the corner method top bottom , 9 sec. without 
inspection.  M. Guimond solve 7 sec.  same method with 2 step, I 
think (secret man).    

Aniway the first step is faster. Easy algorythm method.

M. Guimond is the giant cubist on the stage at the world rubik&#x27;s cube 
history.  Alien or cubist&amp;magic, the man is very hot!  behind back, 
blindfull and fast, great feeling!

M. Guimond, already had picture of rubik&#x27;cube competition Toronto 82 
on rubikscuberecord.com. The W.C. 2003 at the toronto :))

With 42 algorythm :)) 

The step 3 top bottom D&amp;U ok! but easy 1 sec.!!.

          <div class="email-content">I just had an idea- I just bought custom vinyl self-adhering boat 
letters online. The stuff is good quality and not too expensive. Go 
to http://www.speedysigns.com/decals/ and click on bumper stickers. 
There you can upload the colors you want(you could even put a side 
of the cube in a scanner to get the color exact). When you get the 
sticker, just cut it up into squares and stick &#x27;em on the cube!

You&#x27;re absolutely write adam.  In fact as soon as I posted

          <div class="email-content">Since it itsn&#x27;t specified that it&#x27;s directed at Chris or anyone in 
particular, I&#x27;ll offer an answer.

This kinda depends on whether the remaining two edges are adjacent 
or diagonal of each other (hopefully both on a middle layer as 
Hardwick suggests). I usually grip such that one of the problem 
edges on the FL slot, and the other on one of the R slots (RF or 
RB). Then I apply R2 or not in order to get the same pieces on the 
same layers (read this twice, if you don&#x27;t see what I mean). Then I 
apply (Uu)&#x27; or (Uu)2&#x27; to line up a skew pair, lets denote this 
manuver by P (because it could of just been u&#x27; or u2 also, doesn&#x27;t 
matter). Then do a MONO-FLIP of that skew edge, call this X. Finish 
with P^-1. This is done mathematically as P*X*P^-1, a process known 
as conjugation. I&#x27;ll let you figure out what a mono-flip is, that&#x27;s 
the fun part, any monoflip that doesn&#x27;t affect the u and d layers 
are fine (must not affect center rotation of F,L,R,B either) (Jaap&#x27;s 
site is a good source for this group theory stuff by the way). I try 
to go for a mono-flip that starts me off in solving the partitioned 
3x3x3.

          <div class="email-content">Even though this page is interesting in its  own right, wrapping an 
already existing cube in cardboart to make it look like a Rubik&#x27;s 
cube is not  cube art, because this type of art does not use Rubik&#x27;s 
cube as art medium. I admit that teiddling an 8&#x27;x8&#x27;x8&#x27; cube would be 
rather difficult, assuming it was built like the 3x3x3 cube.
It would be fun to speed solve such a cube. Speedcubists, how about 
it?

Thank you. What surprises me is that no one, on or off the web, is 
able to find other cube artists who do 3d designs. Even here in 
Toronto there is no one, so I am told. If it were in Westmont, 
Illkinois, I would understand, but this is the gathering of the 
cubing elite!

My motheur is coming with me.She is definitely not a cube, looks on 
cube art as an/ aberration of her crazy daughter. :-)

I just counted and saw that my guess of 10x10x10 was right!

[Thanks to the guy who emailed me separately with a pic of the cube. 
After seeing your email I thought I&#x27;d have another search online for 
a good shot of the cube without any people in the way in the photo.]

          <div class="email-content">I sort of stopped cubing after either messing up the hungy cubes I <br>
got, or getting messed up ones. In any case, I got more interested in <br>
video games(competitively though). I picked up a cube recently and <br>
found out I forgot most of the OLL. Maybe sometime in the future I&#x27;ll <br>
pick it up again for kicks, but it just doesn&#x27;t old any satisfaction <br>
for me anymore.<br>
<br>
Probably because I&#x27;m a pessimist. There can be only one person that&#x27;s <br>
the best. You could be it, but the ammount of time to put into it is <br>
sickening. Even if you have a natural talent for it. So why even <br>
bother? Really 20 seconds, 19 seconds, 1 second doesn&#x27;t have any <br>
meaning but what you give it. At least this is how I view it. I know <br>
other people view it differently and its fun to be as efficient as <br>
possible... I don&#x27;t know. I know it can be addicting, but only for so <br>
long... I mean really, there&#x27;s a point where addictions become <br>
unhealthy. Though I should speak, I spend 8 hours playing counter-<br>
strike, lol.... <br>
<br>
Anyway, cube on my friends, I still love watching other people solve <br>
it fast. And as long as I have my 27 second solve video for me to <br>
show people, I&#x27;ll be satisified.<br>

<br>
If you want Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes, then http://www.rubikshop.com is <br>
probably the place to go.  If you want cubes that many would agree <br>
are better (made by EastSheen) go to http://www.mefferts.com .  These <br>
cubes are also cheaper, including free shipping to anywhere in the <br>
world (it just takes a couple weeks to get it that way) .<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Today after lunch break my colleagues surprised me by setting up <br>
a &quot;full WC environment&quot; in which I needed to set an average of 12 <br>
cubes. We followed the same rules, the only difference being that <br>
one of my colleagues used a stopwatch instead of a speedstacking <br>
timer.<br>
They were really putting pressure on me, and many colleagues were <br>
watching. It felt like I was on that stage, and I wasn&#x27;t happy with <br>
my performance.<br>
Do not consider this a way to make you guys nervous, but here are <br>
some things that you have to take notice of. This experience helped <br>
me, so maybe it will help you too.<br>
<br>
1) your hands may feel cold<br>
2) your hands may feel wet<br>
3) you may want to go too fast<br>
This may result in:<br>
a) many more mistakes than normal (like wrong order of cross edges, <br>
wrong corner/edge pairs, OLL/PLL going wrong)<br>
b) more time to find F2L pairs<br>
c) more cube lock-ups<br>
d) more cube pops<br>
<br>
Be prepared!<br>
He who performs better under pressure will win the WC.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow we will give it another try.<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi All,

   If any of you are tired of dealing with stickers you could always
find a Rubik&#x27;s Game cube, like:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3141894774&amp;category=19187

   These cubes are adjustable and don&#x27;t have a tendency to pop, and
the plastic is slick. They are a version of the deluxe cube, but
aren&#x27;t as expensive.

once you reached the LL it instantly progressed into the point where <br>
all that was needed was a sune (cool but fairly hard to get). Aside <br>
from that it was a fun video to watch. You know what you&#x27;re doing :P <br>

          <div class="email-content">yeah, I have about 20 F2L and LL algs memorized. there is a way I 
found to do the F2LL that only requires 2 algs, but it takes some 
thinking and moving corner pieces in by themselves, so it is kind of 
slow.  I get mad at myself when I use those 2 too much and it slows 
me down. It is good to not get into a habbit of using the same ones 
over and over.

I once experimented with a slight variation on this: to orient edges<br>
along the way. Without orienting edges, you are sort of building up the<br>
F2L without two of the edges down through the middle. It is not<br>
difficult, while building this much, to &quot;drag in&quot; the nearest already<br>
oriented edges into those holes (or by some other method).<br>

Hi Gilles,

   Very interesting. This is almost the same as the way I solve the
4x4x4. I wondered if it would be good for solving the 3x3x3, and now I
see it can be. Vey cool. Your illustrations are the best I&#x27;ve seen.

   How much slower is this than your original solving style?

          <div class="email-content">I am really excited to see the new speed cubing systems that people have<br>
invented in the past year. I am interested in finding the ultimate<br>
system that will allow someone to break the 10 second barrier - average.<br>
Yes, it is more like a lifetime ambition, but that&#x27;s good because it<br>
will be sure to maintain my interested in the cube long into the future.<br>
<br>
I predict that a 13 second average, or something close, will be achieved<br>
somewhere in the near future.<br>
<br>
The standard F2L+OLL+PLL has been tested and well proven. However, it is<br>
not the fastest system possible. We should not stop looking just because<br>
we have found something that is the fastest we have found so far.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, as we try to shave off more and more moves, it becomes<br>
limiting to divide the solution into rigid steps. There is no single<br>
sequence of steps that, if followed every time, will always produce an<br>
elegant solution. Thus, I think that an intuitive-based system will be<br>
the key for eventually breaking the 10 second barrier. We would need to<br>
have a more advanced understanding of the cube, to not blindly apply<br>
algorithms, and perhaps also to be fully aware of pieces all around the<br>
cube. Blindfolded cubing may be helpful practice for this.<br>

A question which has been nagging me for quite some time is the 
process of memorizing algorithms. I tried learning the Fridrich 
method and got all the way to f2l pretty okay (without algorithms). 
My question is a fast and effective way to learn the rest of the 
algorithms. I am starting to get serious about the cube and hope to 
go the WC2005 (if there is one). Anything is appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.

          <div class="email-content">DanG, 
I was hoping someone would give me the generally-accepted procedure 
for scoring the situation described below, but maybe you can just 
tell me how it would be ruled at the WC.  In this week&#x27;s Sunday 
Contest I did my best average of 10, but one of the times in the 
middle was a pop.  The piece didn&#x27;t come all the way off the cube so 
I pushed it back in and kept going.

Just in case that time was going to be counted as a pop and thrown 
out, I did a 13th time.  Either way it&#x27;s going to be my best average 
but I&#x27;m not sure whether I can use the time from the pop or whether 
I have to throw it out and use my 13th time.

Let me know if this isn&#x27;t clear.

Hope you&#x27;re not too overwhelmed leading up to next week&#x27;s event.
Thanks, Adam

Hold the cube so these pieces are at UF, and do this:<br>
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2<br>
<br>
If you flip the edge prior to doing anything else on the LL, hold the <br>
cube so these pieces are at UF and the LL is on U.  Then you can move <br>
the faces with the slice moves, and it won&#x27;t mess anything else up.  <br>
If you do the entire LL first, though, you will need to move just the <br>
slices as indicated.  So, if you do it at the beginning of the LL, <br>
the sequence would be:<br>
(R2r2) B2 U2 (L l) U2 (R&#x27;r&#x27;) U2 (R r) U2 F2 (R r) F2 (L&#x27;l&#x27;) B2 (R2r2)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I prefer standing. Usually my arms are sort of outish, so when I&#x27;m 
sitting, my elbows get crowded and I can&#x27;t move my hands as fast. 
Weird how the position of my elbows can affect the movement of my 
hands.
Also I think that we&#x27;ll need to stand at the WC. So it&#x27;s better to 
get used to that.

I&#x27;ve memorized every OLL&amp;PLL (well, almost) and it still
took me some time to get sub-20!

I guess the SECRET is all in the F2L...

          <div class="email-content">Like it was suggested several months ago, it is much cheaper to get 
a plane ticket to New York and take a cab or something to Toronto 
(so that it&#x27;s not considered an international flight, but rather a 
domestic one).
Cab fare might be a bit expensive, rent a car, or ask the many NY 
cubers if they could give you a ride (for gas money as you 
suggested). Just another idea to consider...

position), I got this one from Akimoto.

Toronto roundtrip, leaving 22 Aug, returning 25 Aug and saw prices 
of $US368 and $US377 (not sure if this included taxes or not). It 
was flying Continental Airlines and had one connection (ie. not a 
direct flight).

Most of the other prices he saw were around $US700 so I guess the 
fares above are pretty cheap.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody, my first post in this group will be an algorithm <br>
question:<br>
<br>
I have solved the rubiks revenge almost completely, I first turned it <br>
into a &quot;3x3x3&quot;, but with one flaw. The yellow and white faces never <br>
got solved, still half the white face is yellow, and vice versa. The <br>
rest of the revenge is solved, though. <br>
<br>
My question is, does anyone have clue on how to solve this case? <br>
Since the rest of the cube is solved I cant afford to mess up any <br>
other cubies in favor of these last two faces. <br>
<br>
I dont have the revenge on me right now, and I havent looked at it <br>
for a few days, but it looks like one of these two alternatives (not <br>
sure which):<br>
<br>
F <br>
W W W W <br>
W W W W <br>
W Y Y W <br>
W W W W <br>
<br>
B<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
Y W W Y<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
F <br>
W W W W <br>
W W W W <br>
W Y Y W <br>
W W W W <br>
<br>
B<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
Y W W Y<br>
Y Y Y Y<br>
<br>
Reminder: The rest of the cube is SOLVED. Again, I cant use <br>
algorithms that mess up certain other cubies in favour of these two <br>
faces, unless I have further algorithms to use.<br>
<br>
So ... Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
If you want to help me out, best way is by mail, <br>
albin.thorning@h...<br>
<br>
It would be sooo sweet to get this thing over with .. So I can <br>
scramble it again and start over :p<br>

          <div class="email-content">n---,
you might just have to get used to it: know how to deal with the 
basic patterns...know how a move to get in a cross piece might affect 
another cross piece...and see ahead...
When you have mastered the cross, you should be able to take 
advantage of any combination of position/orientation the cross pieces 
are in...
Almost all cross can be solved within 6 moves or so.
The best advice I can give you is, keep trying!

I hope that helps,
Macky

I make the cross on D-face.
makes it harder to see ahead on cross, but less delay between cross 
and F2L. After much practice, even cross and F2L all in one smooth 
fingering becomes possible (I can almost never do that though)
it might be a good option to think about...

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I would suggest using Ron&#x27;s Cube Solver Tool (go to speedcubing.com, <br>
click on tools and other stuff).  You can set up different cross <br>
scenarios, making sure you ignore everything except the cross pieces <br>
by turning the other pieces gray. <br>
<br>
Have the Cube Solver find a solution...and you will see how to <br>
efficiently form a cross, given any situation...it&#x27;s a wonderful <br>
tool.<br>

Can you post a url so we can see for ourselves if it is more organised<br>
and easier to follow? Considering I could not find it, I doubt it&#x27;s<br>
organised or easy to follow.<br>
<br>
On Rubik&#x27;s Champs, the menu is: Venue, Rules/Info, Events, Register,<br>
Contact, Records, Competition, Information, Cube Links, Press. Which one<br>
would &quot;forums&quot; be under??<br>
<br>
On Rubiks.com, the menu is: Products, Play Online, Information,<br>
Promotion, Contact, Links, plus some icons without labels. Which one<br>
would &quot;forums&quot; be under??<br>
<br>
Of course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither Rubik&#x27;s<br>
Champs nor Rubiks.com should be allowed to host our community forum<br>
because then there would be commercial interests involved (in the<br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube specifically). They may be direct or indirect influences<br>
(in the case of rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would be unfair<br>
for any single &quot;cube company&quot; to get into such a powerful position. You<br>
have already seen the effects of this at the championships, which not<br>
everybody is entirely happy with. For example, in that instance,<br>
Rubiks.com is in a position to stamp out any other brands of cube for<br>
the competition. For a discussion forum, we are not so helpless that we<br>
must turn to the help of a company that clearly wants to stamp out other<br>
brands of cube (or turn to one that is easily influenced by such a<br>
company).<br>

the cubes are all made in asia by a company contracted to do so...

our forum is in the proper place....and should not be incorporated

we have made it 3.5 years as is without problems...why change a good

(a) aving a corporate sponsor for a not-for-profit group, event,

Now I realize that the current WC, and the RCC that&#x27;s referred to on

this is a case where it&#x27;s a good thing, since it&#x27;s filling a void

enthusiasts would form their own not-for-profit group/committee and 
manage the sponsor relationships.

I was actually thinking, after the WC, about seeing if there was 
interest in the US in forming a non-profit organization that would 
formalize competition standards, certify records, and organize annual 
or biennial American championships on a regular basis--I guess kind 
of like the speedstacking association.  I thought about trying it in 
the US first because it minimizes travel issues (compared with a 
worldwide group), and because I am already familiar with the laws 
regarding forming a non-profit organization here.  And because I like 
the idea of having regional and national championships in addition to 
world championships--their easier to pull together!

Of course, you know my opinion on all this ;-) I think neither Rubik&#x27;s
Champs nor Rubiks.com should be allowed to host our community forum
because then there would be commercial interests involved (in the
Rubik&#x27;s cube specifically). They may be direct or indirect influences
(in the case of rubiks.com via rubikschamps). I think it would be 
unfair
for any single &quot;cube company&quot; to get into such a powerful position. 
You
have already seen the effects of this at the championships, which not
everybody is entirely happy with. For example, in that instance,
Rubiks.com is in a position to stamp out any other brands of cube for
the competition. For a discussion forum, we are not so helpless that 
we
must turn to the help of a company that clearly wants to stamp out 
other
brands of cube (or turn to one that is easily influenced by such a
company).

          <div class="email-content">there is no need for a non profit group for cubing people...

please remember that the Rubiks name is a very well protected name 
therefore anything that is done will be closely monitored.....

the RCC committee after this event will have a representative from 
the cubing community for the next world championships....RCC will be 
and has set standards using input from our club. Where do you think 
the idea came from???? RCC was created specifically for this....from 
input from our club.

As to cubes types etc....I am permitting Eastsheen cubes which are 
non rubiks. i have been the one fighting them to get what WE AS A 
CLUB WANT....

all they requested was good looking cubes and good stickers. i fought 
them tooth and nail on hundreds of issues surrounding their product 
and i won every battle....

they wanted 1 color scheme...we did not...i voice opinion....we now 
have multiple schemes permitted.........

the way things are now IS JUST FINE to 85 plus percent of the people 
in this club....If we start something new it will only confuse the 
situation even more....

you are not obligated to follow any rules set forth by the RCC 
committe or the licensor&#x27;s of the rubiks name but i must say that you 
will be fighting a long hard battle if you start up a non-profit 
club........to many clubs will confuse everyone.....


keep in mind folks that 21 years ago there were 19 of them competing 
in a best of 3 contest....

21 years later, i built a contest from 4 years of input from this 
club. what occure din 1982 WILL not happen at my event....There will 
always be those with issues.....But then again, maybe perhaps they 
can setup the next world championships to see just how difficult the 
role of &quot;chief&quot; actually is.....

smile guys and gals 8 days left

um, that&#x27;s the lightest I can get the room to be at night...
will try to fix that soon...(hopely)
The &quot;crazy thing&quot; in the back is a building blocks (except they&#x27;re 
not blocks). I&#x27;ve had it since when I was 4 or 5. It comes in 4 
shapes (triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon) and in 6 colors 
(colors of the cube when the orenge sticker has completely been 
peeled off). You can connect the sides of the blocks to create weird-
looking 3-D objects. It&#x27;s not like I play with it anymore, but I have 
to fix it every once in a while because I accidentaly destroy it with 
juggling balls/clubs/rings...

One year ago Wiktoria (less then 6 years old) was competing in

Let&#x27;s hope he isn&#x27;t gonna show up, shall we?

BTW, does anyone know abou the oldest solver?
The cube itself is only about 25 year old, so I bet there aren&#x27;t that 
many over-80 cubists...

Thanks for the info, Dan.

BTW, is there still blackout in Toronto?
I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;ll work it out by next week, but if it happens 
again (which sounds very probable according to AOL news source...) 
and bunch of flights carrying competitors to Toronto get canceled, 
will the WC still go on? 

Thanks,

But, um-, can you be a little more specific? 
What&#x27;s wrong with the lighting?
It seemed all right on my computer...

I&#x27;ll try and fix whatever is wrong for my next videos...

          <div class="email-content">Dan,
Several times when someone who hasn&#x27;t been registered for the WC has 
asked you a question about it, you&#x27;ve responded with something to the 
effect of &quot;you&#x27;re not even registered so what does it matter to 
you.&quot;  In fact, you said that to me once before I was registered.  So 
I think it&#x27;s fair to turn that comment back around on you and ask why 
you care about whether American speedcubers decide to organize an 
American speedcubing club?  You&#x27;re from Canada!  ;-)
 
Seriously though... my primary interest is to develop a group that 
American speed cubers can join, that would promote speedcubing and 
organize national competitions where we could compete regularly in 
person.  If someone is going to start that sort of club, you HAVE to 
incorporate (either as a non-profit or for-profit) or else the group 
won&#x27;t actually exist... it would just be an informal association of 
individuals, which for a number of reasons doesn&#x27;t always benefit the 
group or the members.  I am envisioning an cube organization in the 
states to be a &quot;membership organization&quot; where anyone could join and 
have a say in the organization&#x27;s activities.  From what I understand, 
the RCC is (1) not a U.S. organization, (2) is not actually an 
officially (i.e. legally) organized entity (3) is not an open 
organization but rather a private group that restricts membership to 
a narrowly defined set of people.  Look, like I said before, that&#x27;s 
great...you all are organizing a spectacular event that I&#x27;m looking 
forward to attending.  But I can tell you because I&#x27;ve been a member 
of several open membership clubs (such as the New York Road Runners 
Club, which puts on the New York Marathon) that it&#x27;s a different type 
of thing.  Let me reiterate... not better, just different.  Perhaps 
you&#x27;re right that 85% of people on this group aren&#x27;t interested in a 
US speedcubing club.  That&#x27;s probably because 85% of the people on 
this group aren&#x27;t from the US!

Finally, remember America is a big spread-out country with a large 
percentage of speedcubers.  It&#x27;s harder for us to connect with each 
other and a club like this could help.

Anyway, I brought this up in response to another post.  My intent was 
to wait to propose this to the Americans in this group until after 
the WC, because I thought it would be useful for us all to meet each 
other in person first.  I plan to table this until next month.

&quot;8 days left...&quot;  Holy cow!  It sure has crept up on us fast.  Talk 
to you (in person) soon.

By the way, heard you all may have been part of the blackout.  Hope 
you didn&#x27;t lose power for too long.
Best,
Adam

          <div class="email-content">There was a discussion about an official club a while back. Everyone 
was planning on organizing it, but it kind of died.
Also, why just an American Cube Club? Why not a world one? Sure, 
that might be harder to work out, but we should leave others out 
just because they&#x27;re European or wherever.


And about the forum VS yahoo group:
There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this group. I just think that forums are, 
well, better. I don&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s just my humble opinion.
And when Dan said he didn&#x27;t want a cube forum to be with a profited 
organization like Rubiks.com or Rubikschamps.com, I suddenly had an 
idea: Why not speedcubing.com? That&#x27;s, about the best speedcubing 
site out there anyway, so it would work.

          <div class="email-content">How did you pull that?! Did someone see you and asked if you wanted 
to be on TV, or something? That&#x27;s awesome!

Yesterday a reporter was here, so I&#x27;m going to be in the paper on 
Tuesday. Nowhere near as cool as being on tv, though.... :) I&#x27;ll 
probably upload it to my site as well, for anyone who&#x27;s interested.

the questions has been answered a million times....

in a 12 run trial we remove the fastest and slowest...average of 10 
is taken.

piece popps....1 permitted per average run. if you only have 1 pop, 
your permitted to count that as your slowest time.

if you choose to put it back then thats your doing......however if 
you have more than 1 pop you HAVE to put it back and continue.

i will be watching for people forcing popps on purpose....


just show up and have fun and cube

          <div class="email-content">True, but I think what Adam (or whoever started this thread, oh ya 
Potter) is refering to is something much more sophisticated. Yahoo! 
groups are basically a monotonus list of posts, whereas I&#x27;ve 
seen &quot;better&quot; fourms (true fourms, as I like to think of it). For 
example, www.invisionboard.com/ offers a neat looking fourm. Nice 
features include, the avaliblity of editing your own posts after 
they have been posted (take care of sp errors b4 others nag about 
it), multiple/organized threads, user ratings (cubing exp/number of 
posts/cube ave), user icons/avatars, advanced search options (we 
know have over 6000 posts, many useless ones I&#x27;d like to eliminate, 
but we are nowhere near our 512Kb limit), a separate thread for off 
topic discussions (one for cube art also), more control over the 
look and feel, more compatible and flexible chatter, no more of 
Yahoo&#x27;s irritating limited file and photo space, those ads are very 
annoying also, and private messaging (to the degree of practically 
having another e-mail inbox).

So in this respect, I agree with Adam, that a (true)fourm would be 
better - stable, efficent, uncluttered by ads, etc.. But do we 
really need all that now? I think not, but a Yahoo! group was a good 
step in the right direction (from MIT, Cube Lovers for instance).

Eventually we &#x27;will&#x27; need something better (PHP, assuming we all 
want cubing to gain in popularity) and I know of several member that 
have large server space (heck I have 50Megs), a great domain 
address, and more importantly the programming skills to put it all 
together. I guess I spend a lot of time in various fourms - many 
with over 2000 members, over 60000 posts - being the geek I am. 
Also, I think we should of had more serious discourse about James&#x27;s 
fourm question instead of quickly disregarding it, and to Ryan, of 
course it has to be not controlled or affiliated with some major toy 
company :). Just wanted to make sure we&#x27;d be ready for changes when 
and if they will be needed in the future. (I couldn&#x27;t do much to 
initiate it, but I&#x27;d put in the time to maintain it.)

Ahhhhhhhhhh..... just a week left!!!!! Good luck to Jon and Brent on 
their upcomming media engagements, I&#x27;ve been trying the Detriot Free 
Press and local tv stations will no luck, well it&#x27;s too soon to see 
(either way it&#x27;ll probably happen after wc for me; hemm, if I fail 
miserably, any possible interviews would be canceled so I better at 
least keep all my times under 30s....).

Does this also mean we can use cutting sheets with different colors 
from the official coloring as stickers, as long as the they look nice?
I don&#x27;t use cutting sheets, but there&#x27;s been this type of question in 
JSCC (Japan Speed Cubing Club) Forum...
thought I should ask and report back.

Thanks,

Macky

Someone else started the thread about forums.  My interest was in a <br>
Rubik&#x27;s club that would be regional enough NOT to be Internet-based, <br>
not just a better Internet-based thing.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the Yahoo group, but I don&#x27;t know all the possible <br>
features we could have with a better forum.  On thing I don&#x27;t like <br>
about this group... if you set the feature to hide your email address <br>
in the Members list, you can&#x27;t post by email anymore.  You have to <br>
use the web form.<br>

<br>
True, but I think what Adam (or whoever started this thread, oh ya <br>
Potter) is refering to is something much more sophisticated. Yahoo! <br>
groups are basically a monotonus list of posts, whereas I&#x27;ve <br>
seen &quot;better&quot; fourms (true fourms, as I like to think of it). For <br>
example, www.invisionboard.com/ offers a neat looking fourm. Nice <br>
features include, the avaliblity of editing your own posts after <br>
they have been posted (take care of sp errors b4 others nag about <br>
it), multiple/organized threads, user ratings (cubing exp/number of <br>
posts/cube ave), user icons/avatars, advanced search options (we <br>
know have over 6000 posts, many useless ones I&#x27;d like to eliminate, <br>
but we are nowhere near our 512Kb limit), a separate thread for off <br>
topic discussions (one for cube art also), more control over the <br>
look and feel, more compatible and flexible chatter, no more of <br>
Yahoo&#x27;s irritating limited file and photo space, those ads are very <br>
annoying also, and private messaging (to the degree of practically <br>
having another e-mail inbox).<br>

that the Square-1 event is not listed in this schedule. And the

explain this further?

          <div class="email-content">Dan,
In post 5577 you discussed the following:
&quot;Day 1 is meet and great day...you show up ,register,meet and greet 
and when your good and ready you step up to the podiums and give me 
your best average... This day 1 averaging is for seeding and means 
nothing..Day 1 is designed for all of you to relax so you can give 
your best performance.&quot;

In the post today you say:
&quot;3x3x3 Eliminations will occur on day 1.&quot;

Is this a change in plans, or am I misinterpreting what you&#x27;re saying 
below?

Thanks!
Adam

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been computer-solving a bunch of different positions lately,<br>
including counting the number of minimal-length solutions to some<br>
positions.  Typically a position will have a handful of minimal-length<br>
solutions, at best.  Looking at some symmetrical positions, I&#x27;ve found<br>
some positions that have hundreds of solutions, including three that<br>
have 800-odd minimal length solutions.  (I am not counting things like<br>
R2L2 and L2R2 as distinct solutions, but I am counting reflections and<br>
rotations as distinct solutions, for those patterns that are symmetrical.)<br>
<br>
Well, so this morning I log on and browse some of the numbers.  I&#x27;ve<br>
found one position that has 28,544 minimal (length 17) solutions!  The<br>
runner-up position (that I&#x27;ve examined so far) has only 1,416<br>
solutions.  Each of 8 different first moves from this new position<br>
gives a new position that beats the old runner up!<br>
<br>
The position is:<br>

<br>
I&#x27;ve been cubing for a few months now and I can&#x27;t seem to beat the <br>
1:05 barrier.  I&#x27;ve even created some of my own algorythms which cut <br>
off about 20 seconds.  I&#x27;m using the basic three-layer technique and <br>
my hands are flying just to solve it in 65 seconds.<br>
<br>
So I know I gotta switch to the more elaborate F2L methods.  What <br>
would be a logical first algorythm or first &quot;few&quot; algorythms to <br>
memorize as I step into this new technique.<br>

Sorry I don&#x27;t know anyone from Colorado (that can solve the cube), but you can find rather easy ways on the net in some places...  it can only take a day if your determined enough to solve it.  i have a beginner&#x27;s solution on my site, but again, you said you don&#x27;t want an applet program, but just _in_case_ your in the worst case scenario, go to my site ( www.freewebs.com/brentsuniverse ) and go to my speedcubing section.  it&#x27;s really not the best out there, cuz there&#x27;s LOADS of sites, but mine is just _one_ that is sraight forward and as easy as i think it could be....sorry tho

&gt; What would be a logical first algorythm or first &quot;few&quot; algorythms<br>
&gt; to memorize as I step into this new technique.<br>
<br>
Try counting how many moves it takes to solve the cube.  Keep in mind <br>
that an efficient (speed) solution can solve the cube in an average <br>
of under 60 moves.<br>
<br>
That said, I think a reasonable starting recommendation would be to <br>
learn a four look LL:<br>
Orient corners (7 algs)<br>
Orient edges (3 algs)<br>
Permute (position) corners (2-3 algs)<br>
Permute edges (4 algs)<br>
<br>
This is only 17 algs, and is a good first step toward a good LL.  If <br>
this seems like too big of a step, then you can always cut that back <br>
a little by learning only some of the algs from each set, and <br>
applying 2 algs as necessary.  For example, all 7 corner orientation <br>
cases can be solved in one or two steps with just 2 algs that rotate <br>
just 3 corners.  You can then use this to work into a 4 look LL.<br>
<br>
Either way, algs can be found on countless websites... I&#x27;d start with <br>
http://www.SpeedCubing.com , and go to the links page there, if you <br>
find the algs there don&#x27;t work for you (or just to see different <br>
options).<br>
<br>
Once you have a 4 look LL, I would recommend working on getting a <br>
solid F2L... Again, algs are everywhere!<br>

Hey all
    I didn&#x27;t realize that there would be non-rubik&#x27;s sections at the WC...
specifically the minx.  Now I&quot;m all depressed! Hehe
    Anyway, is there a follow-up championship scheduled?  I thought I heard
2005 rumors.  Anyway, school and money prevent me from attending this year&#x27;s
WC :(  So you better come back with good stories and lots of video for me to
look at!  Good luck to all competitors!

          <div class="email-content">we were all (and some are still, respectively) at the point of 1 minute...  I highly recommend the site of _Jessica Fridrich_...  I&#x27;m not saying it will be the best for _you_, but it is for me.  I really can&#x27;t even start the _Lars Petrus_ way at all (well, maybe..)  but stil, everyone will have different thoughts, but mine: Fridrich.  (use search engine to find link).  With the Fridrich system, my fastest f2l is probably 8 secs (and still people have gone faster).

Hi Everybody,

I&#x27;ve been cubing for a few months now and I can&#x27;t seem to beat the 
1:05 barrier.  I&#x27;ve even created some of my own algorythms which cut 
off about 20 seconds.  I&#x27;m using the basic three-layer technique and 
my hands are flying just to solve it in 65 seconds.

So I know I gotta switch to the more elaborate F2L methods.  What 
would be a logical first algorythm or first &quot;few&quot; algorythms to 
memorize as I step into this new technique.

Thanks
John Dreese

I think you understand the problem here, even if you won&#x27;t admit it.  <br>
People need time to travel to the event and back home afterwards.  <br>
Especially for those living far away (e.g. Australia, not Canada), <br>
they can&#x27;t leave for the event after class on Friday, participate, <br>
and then arrive back home in time for class on Monday morning.<br>
<br>
Besides, many people are taking the opportunity to get together for a <br>
while before the event actually begins (or would like to, but can&#x27;t <br>
because of class).  I live in Illinois, USA (just 10 hours&#x27; drive <br>
away), and I&#x27;m still taking 2 days off work for the event, just to <br>
allow time to travel there and back.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Very good idea. I think other&#x27;s have tried though, I saw one one 
Lars site and Olly&#x27;s site for instance. Heck, I&#x27;ve even tried a bit. 
But I realized that there are going to be some major disputes on 
terminology. So it would be great if we could adopt what a majority 
of us decide on. And as long as everything is mathematically 
correct, I&#x27;ll be happy. This should however prove to be easier to 
get a consensus on then Notation at least. (I found out that I&#x27;ve 
been incorrectly using &quot;M&quot; notation, grr... Olly does this also it 
seems.)

Be sure to clear up confusions and myths, like the difference 
between layer and face as a basic one. And list multiple definitions 
for simple words like &quot;twist&quot; which can be used in multiple ways... 
This would probably be best host on a well-established site however.

concentrate on our cubing but also giving the media some interesting 
stories. Publicity from the championships should raise the profile 
and popularity of speedcubing and I think that&#x27;s something we all

I&#x27;m happy to talk to reporters, but they may not be too interested 
in talking to me since I&#x27;m slow compared to many competitors. On the 
other hand, I&#x27;m female and from Australia which I guess makes me a 
bit different to most other competitors.

          <div class="email-content">Grant,
I&#x27;m in the same boat.  I&#x27;m leaving after work Friday, and am flying 
home late Sunday to be able to see my daughter off for her first day 
of first grade on Monday morning.  (She thinks I&#x27;m an absolute 
superstar just for being in the WC, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not able to 
bring her to Toronto because of her school schedule.)  There just 
wasn&#x27;t any leeway to be in Toronto for a longer period of time.

However I know from organizing a 2,000-person footrace here in 
Virginia there&#x27;s no way to get a perfect weekend.  Usually for 
organizers it comes down to there being one weekend when you CAN have 
the event, rather than being able to pick from a number of dates.

Anyway, I&#x27;ve heard about various get-togethers Thursday and Friday 
night.  I hope there&#x27;s something going on Saturday evening as well 
for those of us getting in late.

wrong.  Just wanted to express my increased desire to go in light of new<br>
facts I dug up.  You&#x27;ve done a lot of work DanG and we all appreciate it!<br>
    It is mostly the travel requiremnts on the preceding Friday that causes<br>
me problems in attending, as we don&#x27;t have classes on weekends here either,<br>
but we don&#x27;t have flights that way late enough after class on friday or<br>
early enough on saturday either.<br>
    And if there IS going to be another competition in the future, I&#x27;ll<br>

          <div class="email-content">still has nothing to do with the setup of the event....

and also not our issue to worry about....fully open event which was 
announced 1.5 years ago.,..the fact that someone cant make it becsue 
of school or whatever is not our issue...

you all had the time to make changes and we as an org team held the 
event in the summer time....


ps-next championships - you can organize to see what it takes to do 
what took me 4 years to accomplish...

wanna give it a shot next time around? by all means step up!!

          <div class="email-content">only thing worrying me is the power...if power goes out then we have 
to move everything to another area of the venue...which will be a 
pain in the #$%^

i do also suspect a few minor issues with respect to cubes, stickers 
etc..

a few might complain about this and that...but we dont expect 
anything out of the norm...

we are praying anyway....

The best thing about this whole venture which made everything worth 
all the hassle and effort over the last 4 years was receiving an 
email from Mr. Rubik last week personally thanking me for my 
efforts....plus I got an invite to visit him next time I am in Hungary
(which will be in October as I am considering the Cube day thing 
again-might as well kill 2 birds with 1 stone)

upon receiving that, there is basically nothing anyone can do or say 
to make things goes out of whack....

The competitors should now be the ones getting nervous....haha


ps-all the sponsors are now in Toronto as well as alot of the 
competitors......

<br>
Also, I was wondering something else: Going to the competition, I&#x27;m <br>

          <div class="email-content">When solving (3x3 in my case) for the Championships how will this <br>
take place?<br>
<br>
On Day 1 of the competition, will we be solving on a stage, with a <br>
group of people? alone? in a solo room?  I can&#x27;t find anywhere that <br>
answers this. <br>
<br>
Also, will I be standing like in the Budapest championships, or <br>
sitting in a chair?<br>
<br>
On day 1 will I just solve the cube once, to advance to day 2&#x27;s <br>
competition, or 3 solve average, 10?<br>
<br>
One more question, what are the rules regarding pops? <br>
<br>
Often, my cube will pop, but the piece will not fly out, just stay in <br>
and I just push it back in while solving.  Is this legal here.<br>
<br>
The thing that scares me most is that sometime I&#x27;ll be solving, and <br>
I&#x27;ll hit a corner, and it will rotate.  At the end, then I have to <br>
rotate it back.  Is this legal?  Because how would people know that <br>
I&#x27;m not cheating?<br>
<br>
sorry for all the questions, I couldn&#x27;t find any answers, and would <br>
certainly like to know so that I can prepare myself.<br>

It&#x27;s only 10-minutes-walk away from Crowne Plaza Hotel.
If that one&#x27;s full, maybe you could try the one right by the airport.

The hotel was full a month or two ago, but there is a block of rooms <br>
reserved specifically for Rubik&#x27;s Championship competitors... If you <br>
don&#x27;t ask specifically about this, they will say they are full.  If <br>
the reserved rooms are also all booked, then I don&#x27;t know what you <br>
can do aside from looking for a roommate or another hotel.<br>

I will try and make accurate definitions, but I need other people&#x27;s 
help for that. There isn&#x27;t yet a complete definition accepted by 
everyone set for anything...ex. the notation...
Would be great if you or someone else could send me definitions or 
take a poll or something...

Of course, I will put names of contributers on my site...

          <div class="email-content">my first thought was to say &quot;see you in 2 days&quot;<br>
<br>
but....<br>
<br>
<br>
 On Day 1 of the competition, will we be solving on a stage, with a <br>
 group of people? alone? in a solo room?  I can&#x27;t find anywhere that <br>
 answers this. <br>
<br>
danG- as in all competitions....yes...their is a stage,a group of <br>
people in an 2900 square foot room on day 1..<br>
<br>
whats nice about this is the design of the podiums...there will be 5 <br>
and all 5 will be active through the entire day..<br>
<br>
at each podium(you will be standing unless you have a medical <br>
reason) there will be 2 judges/officials. 1 to scramble the cube and <br>
1 to man the stopwatch.....<br>
<br>
sequence will be explain when you arrive....<br>
<br>
 On day 1 will I just solve the cube once, to advance to day 2&#x27;s <br>
 competition, or 3 solve average, 10?<br>
<br>
<br>
danG-there have been changed made due to time constraints....the <br>
first round will be an average of 10.....total number of competitors <br>
registered will determine how many move forward into the next round.<br>
the rounds are...average of 10,7,5,3<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 One more question, what are the rules regarding pops? <br>
<br>
danG-we have been down this road many times....<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 Often, my cube will pop, but the piece will not fly out, just stay <br>
in <br>
 and I just push it back in while solving.  <br>
<br>
danG-your choice....you get 1 pop per round.....if you popp it twice <br>
then you are permitted to use that popp as your slowest time(which <br>
in turn will be discarded). ***however****.....we will be watching <br>
for &quot;forced&quot; popps.....be cautious and prepared<br>
 <br>
 The thing that scares me most is that sometime I&#x27;ll be solving, and <br>
 I&#x27;ll hit a corner, and it will rotate.  At the end, then I have to <br>
 rotate it back.  Is this legal? <br>
<br>
danG-treated as a pop...same rules apply. plus this is something <br>
that doesnt happen a whole lot..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Because how would people know that <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m not cheating?<br>
<br>
danG-i want to see you solve it with it turned<br>
<br>
<br>
 sorry for all the questions, I couldn&#x27;t find any answers, and would <br>
&gt; certainly like to know so that I can prepare myself.<br>
<br>
danG-you owe me a 20 for my time....!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
kidding...<br>
<br>
<br>
see you in a few days...good luck!<br>

my first thought was to say &quot;see you in 2 days&quot;

but....


On Day 1 of the competition, will we be solving on a stage, with a 
group of people? alone? in a solo room?  I can&#x27;t find anywhere that 
answers this. 

danG- as in all competitions....yes...their is a stage,a group of 
people in an 2900 square foot room on day 1..

whats nice about this is the design of the podiums...there will be 5 
and all 5 will be active through the entire day..

at each podium(you will be standing unless you have a medical 
reason) there will be 2 judges/officials. 1 to scramble the cube and 
1 to man the stopwatch.....

sequence will be explain when you arrive....

On day 1 will I just solve the cube once, to advance to day 2&#x27;s 
competition, or 3 solve average, 10?


danG-there have been changed made due to time constraints....the 
first round will be an average of 10.....total number of competitors 
registered will determine how many move forward into the next round.
the rounds are...average of 10,7,5,3



One more question, what are the rules regarding pops? 

danG-we have been down this road many times....



Often, my cube will pop, but the piece will not fly out, just stay 
in 
and I just push it back in while solving.  

danG-your choice....you get 1 pop per round.....if you popp it twice 
then you are permitted to use that popp as your slowest time(which 
in turn will be discarded). ***however****.....we will be watching 
for &quot;forced&quot; popps.....be cautious and prepared

The thing that scares me most is that sometime I&#x27;ll be solving, and 
I&#x27;ll hit a corner, and it will rotate.  At the end, then I have to 
rotate it back.  Is this legal? 

danG-treated as a pop...same rules apply. plus this is something 
that doesnt happen a whole lot..




Because how would people know that 
> I&#x27;m not cheating?

danG-i want to see you solve it with it turned


sorry for all the questions, I couldn&#x27;t find any answers, and would

danG-you owe me a 20 for my time....!!!



kidding...


see you in a few days...good luck!

I am staying there Friday night with Mirek because Crowne plaza was 
booked. We stay at Crowne Plaza for the remainder of our stay in 
Toronto. Good luck with the hotel.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Macky,

   Who ever told you there was an agreed upon notation? I know of
several in use.

   I use:

First off there are three basic turns. For example:
R = Right layer clockwise
R2 = Right layer 180 degrees
R&#x27; = Right layer counterclockwise

Then there are six sides:

R = Right layer clockwise
U = Top layer clockwise
B = Back layer clockwise
L = Left layer clockwise
F = Front layer clockwise
D = Lowest layer clockwise


Then there are the middle layers or  slices:

r = center slice next to R
u = center slice under U
b = center slice in front of B
l = center slice next to L
d = center slice over D
f = center slice in back of F

And finally rotating the whole cube in your hand (used for &quot;finger
tricks&quot;) (Q stands for cube)

QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right
QU = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the top
QB = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the back

  The reasons I prefer this notation are: 

1. the consistant lettering means not having to figure out which is
the x,y or z axis or the M S E slices etc. The slice are the same
letter as either side adjacent.

2. There are provisions for rotating the cube.

3. This can be applied to the 4x4x4 with no changes.

but, mm...

I use MSE, xyz, a &amp; s, (FSC),-, w (for double layer. JSCC notation), 
and maybe some other stuff...

This is hard... how should I do all this?
Any ideas?

p.s. I will be leaving in about 12 hours from now. I got eat dinner, 
get packing, and get some sleep by then...
will reply when I&#x27;m back.

Sorry I keep writing hard-to-get-what-I-mean messages...
In JSCC though, we seem to have a pretty solid thing for notation.
(I&#x27;m the only one who uses x,u,y, etc.)

Anyways, thanks for answering all my questions (including really 
obvious ones), Dan. Gotta thank you a lot for solving the sticker 
problems, the cube problems... all those things.
I&#x27;ll see you in Toronto!

   Turning two layers at a time the notation (which would be the same
for 4x4x4) would be Rr. After all, you&#x27;re turning two layers, so using
two letters can be less confusing. And if you choose they can be
written separately.

   For those who already know x, y and z axes it may be visually
clearer at first, but you don&#x27;t remember, and that&#x27;s my point. I&#x27;m
told that &quot;Q&quot; for cube is very easy to remember.

   Why bother with a lower case letter of another set of letters?

( but I want to see lots of pics and videos. I heard that the wc was <br>
going to be broadcast live on the internet. Is that still happening? <br>
and if so on what site would it be on? I would love to at least see <br>
it.<br>
--barefoot Chris<br>
<br>
p.s. Are there any other cubers in Rhode Island??<br>

ago sprayed it with silicone lubricant.  After playing with it<br>
briefly, I put it away for a year and a half, I picked it up today<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the advice on Fridrichs method.  I&#x27;m wondering, which <br>
method is faster: layer-by-layer (F2L) methods or the one where you <br>
solve a quarter of the cube first.<br>
<br>
I currently solve using a brute-force layer-by-layer method in about <br>
65 seconds.  I&#x27;ve been able to memorize one algorythm from Ms. <br>
Fridrichs website and I&#x27;m working on more, but I don&#x27;t want to learn <br>
a method that is ultimately the slowest.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>

          <div class="email-content">definitely learn the fridrich method. its really the opinion of the <br>
cuber that makes something faster or slower. if you are scared to <br>
learn the 80+ algorithms of fridrichs method, you might want to try <br>
the 4-look LL from www.twistymegasite.com. im currently using this <br>
and its pretty good. course, lots of practice will need to go into <br>
it. it&#x27;ll definitely decrease your time after you get used to it. <br>
but dont learn a method just because its not fast. learn for the <br>
experience of learning something.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well gang it was one hectic day..<br>
<br>
started by someone stealing a timer pad and 300 plus cubes along <br>
with 24 rolls of stickers..<br>
<br>
with that said and the fact the the 5x5x5 category took so long to <br>
complete the 3x3x3 format had to be changed.<br>
<br>
Also requiring changing was the non category challenges. Day 1 <br>
originally was to have those categories demonstrated and then once <br>
again on day 2 for the public..<br>
<br>
Changes to be made due to time contraints are:<br>
<br>
all non category challenges are now only a part of the finale.<br>
<br>
the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 categories were cut to best of 3 average and the <br>
finalists are now set to compete tommorrow(top 3 versus rounds). <br>
Finals will be best time out of 3.<br>
<br>
now for the 3x3x3 event. we had to run late at the venue(which by <br>
the way costs us a heck of alot of money) and were only able to get <br>
through 51 competitors.<br>
<br>
There are 32 competitors left to trial in the 3x3x3 event. Only the <br>
first 32 will be in the finals versus original rounds of 10,7,5,3.<br>
<br>
The high cubic puzzles killed us and since we lost our 5th timer due <br>
to theft we were hours behind once the day was finished.<br>
<br>
Only 2 complaints were received from competitors. All others had the <br>
most excellent time. <br>
<br>
Our own Jessica Fridrich even went up and gave us a best of 3 which <br>
was a complishment for myself to acheive her doing it versus <br>
standing on the side lines...<br>
<br>
All eye were on Jessica and everyone gathered around to watch our <br>
icon perform.<br>
<br>
We were all in AWE!!! when Jessica did her thing.<br>
<br>
Dan Knights had the best time of the day in the 3x3x3 event with a <br>
time of 16.71 seconds(something like that-left data sheet at the <br>
venue)...(note.....dan must think Canada has nothing but snow as he <br>
showed up wearing what looked to be a Parka jacket...was a good <br>
laugh when speaking with him however.... He is a good guy! - was <br>
nice meeting him after all these years...)<br>
<br>
only 6 people were able to break the 20 second barrier. Mr. Rubik <br>
must have designed some heavy kick ass scrambles or the guys were a <br>
bit nervous...<br>
<br>
Only 1 person was able to solve the cube blindfolded and only in the <br>
3x3x3 category..I forget the guys name...(will report his name <br>
tommorrow). This was a disappointment to me as we had 30 people in <br>
those events.<br>
<br>
Tommorrow we get to see Jess Bonde do his thing along with Ron van <br>
Bruchem and David Wesley.<br>
<br>
Next time I will bring the data sheet home to provide the numbers <br>
for everyone....<br>
<br>
ps-I had to scramble over 500 cubes today. wife is writing this <br>
email as i have no hands left..<br>
<br>
all for now<br>
<br>
oh ps-we have a sort of a FMC and of course Mirek came back with 27 <br>
moves.....good for first place thus far...round 2 of that event goes <br>
tommorrow...Good work Mirek!!<br>

it&#x27;s really great to see that you could triumph over this setback and 
go on with the show.  Thanks for all your hard work on organizing the 
event and battling the obstacles.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear tomorrows 
results!

          <div class="email-content">These are the results from the &quot;first round&quot;, we don&#x27;t really know 
the rules for the following.

DanK set a new official world record for a single solve (the best of 
three times)

1.  Dan Knights 16.71  
2.  Akimoto     &lt; 18
3.  David Allen &lt; 18
4.  Lars Van den berg &lt;20
5.  Fridrich  &lt; 20 
6.  Jess Bonde > 20
7.  `Macki`
8.  Doug Li
9.  Cammann le pote d` Allen
10. Katsuyuki Konishi
11. Ron van Bruchem
12. David Wesley
13. Chris hardwick &lt; 22
14. Means ??
15. Zbiniew le polonais
16. Jon Morris
17. Thomas Templier  23.90
18. Brent Morgan
19. Grant Tregay
20. David Barr
21. Van der Bronk
22. Goljan Mirek > 24
23. Atkinson ??
24. Frank Morris
25. Lars Petrus > 26
26. Peters ??
27. Frederick Badie ( moi Ouf !) 26.98
28. Dan Harris > 27
29. ...
30. ...
31. ...
32. ...

Unfortunately Frederick and Thomas don&#x27;t remember the 4 last 
qualified for the next round.
It looks like the 1st will compete against the 32nd
the 2nd against the 31st
the 3rd against the 30th

...

still, we are not sure of it.

their times, but they were above 22seconds.<br>
we are sorry, but Frederick and Thomas are NOT official reporters <br>
from Toronto ;););)<br>
<br>
The 8 fastest of the list above will compete in the next round(s)<br>
Again, the times written above are the best of three solves.<br>
<br>
As you can see, and as Ron guessed, some &quot;unknown&quot; guys achieve <br>
really good times, with &quot;unknown&quot; solving method(s) (corners first<br>
(?)). New world record is 16.50.<br>
<br>
we can congratulate www.rubikschamps.com for the great stuff they do <br>
not do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
Ya it&#x27;s kinda late, but there&#x27;s nothing more to be done tomorrow <br>
(eh, perhaps visit OSC again since none of us really had a good <br>
opportunity to check the place out, btw it&#x27;s 4-5 floors deep for <br>
those of you who havn&#x27;t checked it out, a bit of a vertical maze <br>
perhaps). So I was just catching up on the ton of posts, so for all <br>
of you who didn&#x27;t attend and have been requesting pictures/clips <br>
they will be up pretty fast (the two documentaries might take a <br>
while longer, appearently it takes up to a yr to cut/edit). I think <br>
Ron has a good supply of pictures up already. I just thought it&#x27;d be <br>
nice to have a competitor here give a bit of an update since it <br>
seems almost all of us don&#x27;t have time/internet connection to get <br>
through.<br>
<br>
So about 1/3 of us didn&#x27;t get to go yesterday (the Saturday), I was <br>
on of the last few in line. (Oh ya the pressure was on!) So just to <br>
give you folks an idea of the atmosphere here... Everybody seemed <br>
very nice. It was great to be able to put the faces behind the <br>
names. And it was very exciting to meet all these great people, to <br>
cube with them. Learned a few new tricks..., like how to solve the <br>
Magic fast (thanks Jaap), do the 5x5x5 under 30min (lol, thanks <br>
Akimoto), actaully get a 5x5x5 (thanks to Hasbro/Seven Towns Ltd.), <br>
see all these other great puzzles (pariminx, skewb, astrolabacus, <br>
Chris&#x27;s nifty cube 2 triangles for each of the 6 square faces for <br>
center piece solving, seeing DanK want to prove that it is <br>
impossible to flip a single center only, it is not!, of course <br>
Grant&#x27;s bloody bandaged cube that not even Ron could tackle, well <br>
Jake eventually got it, a PROPER 2x2x2, no more grabing Homer in the <br>
eyes for me, etc. can&#x27;t think of much more now). So at the venue it <br>
was an exciting and friendly get-together. Well you know, we sort of <br>
over ran the entire hotel, couldn&#x27;t walk out without hearing the <br>
clicking noises and eventually this became the background sound <br>
every where, one guy compared it to the chirping of crickets... And <br>
of course strange relationship with the front desk people, I had to <br>
do a cold solve after 7 hrs of driving for them, 23 something I <br>
recall. Typical, Ton had to cube in front of Customs. Turning in <br>
left over items (cubes, cube bags, etc. to the front desk). &quot;Did <br>
anyone ask about a missing cube?,&quot; soundly like I&#x27;m yanking their <br>
chain with so many cubes in the building. But ya I almost lost my <br>
bag and there would be like 5 identical in the lost and found to <br>
pick from (all competitors were given 1 cube bag (gotta be stylin&#x27;, <br>
stand, silver cube, shirt, and pin). The pins given out were <br>
apperanetly of the wrong color scheme! (Proud that I was the first <br>
to notice, and don&#x27;t use the normal scheme.) They got it correct on <br>
the bags though. To my displaeasure, none of the 5 podiums were <br>
solvable even after great efforts by the sponsors. Yep two green <br>
stickers on the same edge piece ain&#x27;t gona fly under the radar with <br>
us folks around.<br>
<br>
I suppose the lost of one of the 5 timing devices cost us a great <br>
deal of time, and it probably would have been cheaper to have <br>
purchesed a 6th one for backup then to have to pay the hefty fees of <br>
using the OSC facilities prolonged.<br>
<br>
So I pretty much got to chat with everybody, which was great. Open <br>
up the morning news to see say Ron on the 3rd page (stupid media mis-<br>
caption...) and fall asleep watching Hardwick solve a cube on TV <br>
(MOD, Canada equivalent of MTV). Of course there were a bunch of <br>
others I didn&#x27;t notice, I heard of radio interviews, uhh other <br>
papers and tv programs. I guess know I can speak much more <br>
intelligently about all the cube related things, esp. cubing styles <br>
and people&#x27;s preferences of speedcubes. Of course the first day was <br>
incredibly crowded; the second, with cameras in your face all the <br>
time. I enjoyed talking about my cubing experience with the <br>
documentary folks, just hope they don&#x27;t make me look like a jerk or <br>
something as Ron has suggested (media slander). Of course the gift <br>
shop selling cubes to OSC visitors ran out pretty quick. I got to <br>
see the Lego cube solver. No Erno or Singmaster, but meeting <br>
Fridrich, Ron, Petrus, Knights, and Chris did just fine. The people <br>
who placed recieved his autographed photo. (Yes I know I&#x27;m going <br>
into a bit too much detail, but not every cubist in our community <br>
went.)<br>
<br>
Appearently the signatures of all the cubists is better then gold on <br>
E-bay, everybody had to exchange sigantures. Some suspected I <br>
dismantaled a podium, but those won&#x27;t be used in the future <br>
anyways, :). Having people sign my cube was a bit to cliche for my <br>
taste and signing the little 5x5x5s were awful, the T-shirt idea: <br>
much better(suggestion for WC2005). Personally, I felt the <br>
commentation was awfully insensitive, btw. The guy told us to shutup <br>
and that if we did he would, and every body starts clapping/cheering <br>
loudly, lol.<br>
<br>
So anyways, I had a decent performance. I came in with two goals one <br>
of which I missed by a hair: to get one sub-20 time and to keep all <br>
my times under 30. No terrible times for me, but no great ones <br>
either. Interesting how the final round times were all very bad <br>
(realativly speacking). That round was very tense as you can all <br>
imagine. I think having the audience quiet down was damaging to <br>
people&#x27;s performance, a louder crowd mean&#x27;s less people paying <br>
attention to what your doing and your not as nervous. For me I have <br>
always known I would/could become incredibly nervous in public <br>
situations, esp. public speaking, but no problems today! (I just <br>
looked straight down at the floor or the cube.) The simple aspect of <br>
believing I would be nervous, made me not nervous somehow. Good <br>
paliminaries for me; got a bit frustrated during all the solves of <br>
my second round however, I think I got unlucky scrambles for my <br>
method or my chosen path, but it is difficult to perform in a new <br>
environment. A great deal of commotion about the poor lighting, I <br>
gave some suggestions and got some light from top. People still <br>
complained, but I had no trouble with it, it was more of something <br>
to talk about to not get nervous perhaps.<br>
<br>
So ya getting through the qualifying round automatically puts one <br>
into the top 32 in world rankings. So that makes me happy.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough random thoughts, this fourm shouldn&#x27;t be my diary, so <br>
catch you later...<br>

I am missing the 3x3x3 blindfold competition. Has anybody the results?<br>

championships. Already manufactured.<br>
<br>
But, I don&#x27;t see why you have to put your hands at a special place at<br>
the end (on the pad, in your pockets...) in order to stop the watch.<br>
<br>
In speedstacking, of course, you don&#x27;t have choice. But in<br>
speedcubing, the proper way of stopping the watch would be with a<br>
sensor under the cube.<br>
<br>
After all, the most important thing is: All times measured with the<br>
same device (so, I guess speedstacking pads are now the official tool<br>
:-( ).<br>
<br>
Ok, but I certainly won&#x27;t spend $60 for a $1 stopwatch and a mat with<br>

would you mind going to speed stacks and sending them an email to

could mean a cube timer just for rubiks down the road....

          <div class="email-content">I also liked the StackMat timers from the first time I tried them. I 
don&#x27;t think my times where suffering from it at all. Maybe they could 
make some slight adjustments so that the timer starts from the time 
the cube is picked up, and it stops when put down. But really, 
excellent timing device no matter what. Good choice.

One thing I learned through this whole experience is how accessible 
this little phenomenon of ours is.  At first glance I can see how 
speed cubing may be intimidating but fortunately it&#x27;s also very 
engrossing, captivating, etc.

I was impressed with the attendee&#x27;s as a group.  I dare you to find a 
more friendlier bunch.

Thanks Dan!

          <div class="email-content">Agreed, I liked the speedstack timers. People were complaining it 
added almost 2s to one&#x27;s time, but it was probably just an excuse 
for bad times, lol. A bit expensive for my taste I must say, but I 
might still buy one (not enough features however, can&#x27;t compare to 
Bonde&#x27;s for recording and dynamic average). The media and audience 
were what slowed us down, I believe, and having total silence in the 
final round threw some competitors off; could of helped some of 
course.

So ya, Dror was some machine! Too bad for the 5x5, but the 4x4 is 
hard enough. Might of been easier to do 2 or 3 3x3&#x27;s then a 5x5, but 
I guess it takes a lot of of ya.

And btw folks, we don&#x27;t NEED another WC to keep on cubing so I don&#x27;t 
want to hear anymore nonsense about &quot;what&#x27;s next?&quot;. WC2005 is a 
possiblity especially due to the success of this one (ok, I might 
get a list os disagreements there, but there really wasn&#x27;t enough 
organizers and one man, DanG, can only do so much), but let&#x27;s not 
speculate and wait for some sort of comformation that probably won&#x27;t 
come very soon - remember, this one was pushed back twice.

You know it was great to see the faces behind the SNs. Too bad 
Harris couldn&#x27;t go around taking head shots of everybody (for 
cubestation / profiles / galley), but not all of us want our pic on 
the net.

Although, I use MES notation (be it wrong on the M&#x27;), I think now 
after reading some of these posts that that could be abolished for 
the more friendly/intuitive subscript notation (m,s,a) It&#x27;s not all 
that computer friendly, but better - what do you all think? And 
could someone please forget the xyz stuff! Why fix an coordinate 
system if it has no other uses then for the rotations. &#x27;Q&#x27; I don&#x27;t 
like either but could live with. Since I&#x27;m all for consistancy, 
mayby &#x27;q&#x27; in subscript AFTER the letter? And please don&#x27;t start 
using &quot;R[m]&quot; to indicate subscript if you can&#x27;t embed it in the 
HTML, just go for &quot;Rm&quot;. (m,s,a) is from Mirek as far as I can trace 
back. I have always used something like [r&#x27;] for that sort of stuff, 
I got it from Ross I suppose. Just anything to not add new letters 
to the standard Singmaster Notation!

Um, that&#x27;s a good point about &quot;r&quot; for 3x3 vs. &quot;r&quot; for 4x4. 
It &#x27;should?&#x27; be pretty implicit, but just to avoid confusion 
something new like could be introduced, I was thinking &quot;Rd&quot; for deep 
but that is crap, right? (double meaning, conflict) Perhaps &quot;Rp&quot; for 
deeP since that letter is free. Ok that&#x27;s just rambling....

So does anyone think there was anything unfair about the compition? 
I&#x27;d like to hear some opinions about this, couldn&#x27;t really talk 
about it over the weekend right? Having to go to best of 3 for the 
first 2 rounds were an &quot;interesting change.&quot; (It was planned to be  
like maybe average of 5 or whatever, so assuming there was a good 
reason for THAT, then there&#x27;d be a good reason for best of 3 being a 
bad idea.) Regardless of fairness or one&#x27;s own performance I think 
it&#x27;d of been simply more fun to get to do more official times on the 
pads. (Well, I might have been thinking &quot;Why am I here; just get 
this over with,&quot; lol, when in front of the huge crowd...)

          <div class="email-content">Uh, we definately need both meanings, so both &quot;s&quot; and &quot;m&quot; but they 
are of course equivalent to each other after some whole cube 
rotation. There is just a subtle distinction. And yes I immediately 
noticed where the notation stemed from like I mentioned: Mirek, or 
maybe Jessica. I guess I just had a feealing it was from Mirek...

I don&#x27;t CARE what certain people&#x27;s method PREFERS. Notation is 
notation, it should be independent of system, sort of our universal 
language. (Oh and I don&#x27;t want to have to change to a different 
notation when I&#x27;m explaining my method to someone else, with a 
different method.)

          <div class="email-content">Being the math geek I am, I took the time to do a more complicated <br>
stats sheet for the 32 qualifiers of the 3x3 category. This is not <br>
to single anyone out, well besides those 32. I just used a simple <br>
highlighting rule: green if placed 1,2,3 in one of the rankings and <br>
blue for the remainder if in top 10 in any one of the rankings (hope <br>
you see what I mean).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll momentarily upload the excel file (I used the raw data from <br>
what DanG uploaded earlier, not sure if it&#x27;s the most recent version <br>
with all the name corrections and stuff so please give me any errors <br>
you see, or better yet make them and re-upload/overwrite the file).<br>
<br>
So I did it in 7 distinct rankings: {best,ave} X {round 1, round 2, <br>
1&amp;2 combined} + {Official} in set notation. A bit too much to use <br>
average I know since some people didn&#x27;t go right for the stop on <br>
their slowest times / throw out, but interesting nonetheless. The <br>
only thing I didn&#x27;t do was to give some standard deviation values <br>
for completeness, but with only a size 3 sample size it would of <br>
been fairly useless. (Well..., with that you could better see the <br>
phenomena of inconsistant slower cubists beating out faster <br>
consistant cubists.) (by slower/faster I mean on average)<br>
<br>
Performing dozens of sortings and filterings, I am bound to have <br>
messed up on something, and I tried to keep everything value-based <br>
instead of formula-based.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I got back from Toronto this afternoon. It was really great to meet <br>
you cubers at WC! Much thanks to Dan G for organizing WC and taking <br>
all the questions from me...(lol) Congratulation to Dan K, the new <br>
champ, and all other winners and finalists of the varoius cubing <br>
categories. I did a 20.3 on Day 1, but couldn&#x27;t get a single sub-<br>
20...I guess I just got nervous. I messed up the cross once, did a <br>
wrong F2L combination once, and had a cube drop on 5x5x5(which killed <br>
my arms!). <br>
<br>
  As for the blindfold event, I was told that I only had once chance, <br>
and if I mess up, I was to be disqualified. Jim went before me and <br>
missed two edges flipped, so I got really nervous and decided to go <br>
extra careful. I did it in 6:3?, including memorization, which was a <br>
terrible time for me, but managed to get into the finals. (I bombed <br>
the 4x4x4 on centers) Only Dror and I made it to the finals, and we <br>
had a face-off on Sunday. The results: Both of us messed up in the <br>
final, and since Dror had a better time on the qualifying round, he <br>
got the first place and I the second. <br>
  The fact that we only got one try at it was the biggest mistake in <br>
the BLD categories. In BLD, you can never really be sure if you did <br>
it until you take off the blindfold, and I think it&#x27;s safe to say <br>
that it&#x27;s impossible to keep a 100% accuracy. This results in <br>
competitors getting nervous, going slowly, and the results not being <br>
of one&#x27;s best performance. Also, even with the ear plugs I could <br>
still hear the sound of cube and people talking and feel some sets of <br>
eyes staring at me from behind the curtains and the cameras <br>
rolling... It really wasn&#x27;t the perfect BLD condition. I think BLD <br>
cubers ought to discuss and set rules that are best for BLD sooner or <br>
later...<br>
<br>
OK, now I&#x27;m just rambling again...<br>
<br>
Anyway, Congratulation to all!<br>

          <div class="email-content">You are right, &quot;corners first&quot; cubist like to have notation for middle
layer move. I also developed and used a &quot;corners first, edges last&quot;
system, not for serious speedcubing although it can be mastered to
average below 20s. My notation was Sr for slice move, turning middle
layer between right and left faces clockwise when facing right side of
the cube. I used &quot;r&quot; for turning the whole cube clockwise holding
right face. Thus, r = RsSr, u = UsSu and so on. 
But now I think that Rm is better notation for the same thing as Sr.
Then, r  =  Rs Rm  =  R L&#x27; Rm. 
I would say, Rm is little bit more intuitive notation than Sr.

rueth got called up to participate.  You only care
about getting credit for your times, times that you
got to take at the expense of two other people.  You
should feel great that you lucked out and had a chance
to compete in the semi-finals any, considering you
originally DID NOT QUALIFY.  Instead you told me these
things:
&quot;i want to get credit for what i did&quot;
&quot;they called me up to get times and i want credit for
it&quot;
&quot;I just want to be recognized&quot;

OK, everyone recognize peter babcock right now.  He
was ranked 34th, lucked out and got to go up because
two other people didn&#x27;t show up.  During the
semi-finals he pulled a lucky 24.?? time.  A time that
is admirable because it&#x27;s under his average.  Also
recognize he doesn&#x27;t want to call over anyone&#x27;s
attention to all the great things that went on at the
championships.  I was angry too when I had to go on
sunday for qualifying 3x3.  i wasn&#x27;t too happy that
there was only one run for the megaminx, although i
would have been killed by grant in the category
anyway.  To be in the same room with ron, jessica,
dan, jess, and countless others, was a great
experience.  Meeting some of the people i only knew by
screen name was something interesting all in itself. 
And being interviewed 187 times was...a new

it ends up being.

Hey all, I&#x27;d like to say Hi to all the wonderful super awesome people i met this <br>
weekend, it is great to have a 3D conversation with you.  I would also like to <br>
express my congratulations to all the prize winners out there, you guys are <br>
great.  Also thanks much Dan for pulling this event off, it was like a surreal <br>
dream being surrounded by rotating cubes and the beautiful noise of the <br>
plastic grinding.  <br>
I couldn&#x27;t have been any happier with times i got this weekend.  I thought for <br>
sure that nervousness would take its toll, but yeah...<br>
The timers i feel are pretty cool, after getting used to them and such.  <br>
I feel that the event went well for the most part,  but i feel that 2 days is <br>
definately not enough to get everything done.  <br>
I think the most fun was just getting together with some of you and swap algs <br>
and tips of the trade.  I hope that we can all meet again, hopefully in 2005 if <br>
another competition brews and that i am able to go.   <br>
You guys are awesome!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know about OLLs, but I think for the PLLs it&#x27;s best to just 
use the lettering on Jessica&#x27;s site. (U and A are a bit strange, and 
I always called the J one L, at least I&#x27;ve always called the R 
properly.) I don&#x27;t seen any good way of numbering the OLLs, perhaps 
you should devise of some charting system and call them by letters 
representing two or more charicteristics. I found success in 
organizing the ELLs, but I&#x27;m no expert on OLLs. Perhaps by a letter 
for corner twist and one for edge flip followed by a number or 
lowercase letter within each category.... I don&#x27;t know this is much 
more difficult.

But, yes, it would be nice to see some standardization, just don&#x27;t 
give too big a distintion between mirror cases, (maybe add an a) or 
b)). Due to the recognition aspect of the OLL step there needs to be 
differences in the inverse cases though. Personally, I won&#x27;t use an 
algorithm just for it&#x27;s primary effects and not know it&#x27;s secondary 
effects (permutation in this case).

          <div class="email-content">Some hasty thoughts on the weekend before I go away to Nevada for a week...<br>
<br>
It was of course, by far, the best world championships ever! <br>
Inevitably some things worked less than perfectly. We&#x27;ll learn from <br>
those mistakes next time (and make new ones). The important thing is <br>
that something finally happened. I&#x27;m immensely grateful to Dan G for <br>
doing that heavy and thankless groundwork. It will be easier for <br>
those who come after.<br>
<br>
After having been asked in an interview, I decided that my favorites <br>
were my fellow Swede David, my fellow San Franciscan Dan, my fellow <br>
Lars Lars V, and of course my fellow Budapest survivor Jessica. <br>
Really, I have witnesses! It&#x27;s a little spooky that they took the <br>
first 4 spots! I&#x27;m especially amused that there was a Lars in fourth <br>
place again this time, though Lars V may see that differently.<br>
<br>
My only ambition was to get a result below 25 to feel I had at least <br>
a decent showing. That seemed unambitious enough, but when I started <br>
badly, it made me even more nervous. It was only in the second last <br>
attempt I got 24.99 and could relax a bit for the last attempt and <br>
get 21.91.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s weird, that nightmarish feeling when your brain, your hands and <br>
the cube all seem to move in different time frames, and everything <br>
jams, and the timer just races away the seconds. I saw it in myself <br>
and in many other contestants. I guess this was the first competition <br>
ever for most of the participants, and the first one in 20 years for <br>
most of the rest, and it showed.<br>
<br>
Aside from two championships I had barely met speed cubists in person <br>
before, and it was so much fun. Not only to be among likeminded <br>
people who would also just spin a cube around mindlessly when talking <br>
without even being aware of it (the film teams started asking us to <br>
not do that while being interviewed, since it screws up their sound). <br>
But also for seeing some things I could not have imagined. I thought <br>
the most unbelievable ones were David Allens index finger tricks, <br>
Chris Hardwick&#x27;s one handed magic, and Dan Knights North Pole jacket.<br>
<br>
The final was a real intense drama!! I hope someone makes a good TV <br>
version of it all, that could be a thrilling half hour! One random <br>
fact no one has mentioned was that Dan Knights fastest time, his <br>
last, was achieved while putting back a popped piece! I don&#x27;t know if <br>
anyone keeps track of these things, but i think that 18.76 has to be <br>
the world record for a popped solve!<br>
<br>
I was interviewed more times than I can remember, and I didn&#x27;t always <br>
manage to stop my unfortunate impulse to say whatever outrageous <br>
thing that amuses me most, rather than more sensible things. So I&#x27;m a <br>
little worried what the documentaries will do with that. We&#x27;ll see...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek,

   Would you consider the notation  I use?

First off there are three basic turns.

For example:
R = Right layer clockwise
R2 = Right layer 180 degrees
R&#x27; = Right layer counterclockwise

Then there are six sides:

R = Right layer clockwise
U = Top layer clockwise
B = Back layer clockwise
L = Left layer clockwise
F = Front layer clockwise
D = Lowest layer clockwise

   I think most people agree to this much.

Then there are the middle layers or slices:

r = center slice next to R
u = center slice under U
b = center slice in front of B
l = center slice next to L
d = center slice over D
f = center slice in back of F

And finally rotating the whole cube in your hand (used for &quot;finger
tricks&quot;) (Q stands for cube)

QR = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the right
QU = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the top
QB = Rotate the whole cube clockwise from the back

The reasons I prefer this notation are:

1. the consistant lettering means not having to figure out which is
the x,y or z axis or the M S E slices etc. The slice are the same
letter as either side adjacent.

2. There are provisions for rotating the cube.

3. This can be applied to the 4x4x4 with no changes.

4. There is one letter for moving one layer like &quot;R&#x27; or &quot;r&quot; and the
option of using two for two layers like &quot;Rr&quot;.

5. Except for Q there are no other letters added to the main ones, and
Q for cube seems easier to remember for most.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;blindfoldcubist&quot; &lt;jmittan@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Wed, 27 Aug 2003 04:42:20 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!!<br>
<br>
It was good to meet all of you.  It was extremely interesting for me <br>
to be around true speedcubists for the first time.  It made me <br>
realize that I am probably better suited to blindfolding, (you <br>
speedcubers are so good!!) and at least for me, the two don&#x27;t mix <br>
that well.  I found it difficult to switch from warming up for the <br>
4X4X4 speed cubing, then suddenly shifting gears to participate in <br>
the 3X3X3 blindfold, then going back immediately for 4X4X4 blindfold <br>
speedcubing then going back yet again for 4X4X4 blindfold.  This left <br>
me with insufficient mental energy to have any chance at 4X4X4 <br>
blindfold.  <br>
<br>
I, like Macky, was disappointed to learn that there would be only one <br>
round of the blindfold events.  I wish I had thought to ask the <br>
number of rounds before going in for my attempt.  Perhaps I would <br>
have been more careful to remember to flip those last two edges.  (My <br>
miss was simple omission of 12 moves.)  I just assumed that there <br>
would probably be three rounds.  Having additional rounds would have <br>
given all of us a chance to adapt to the unique circumstances.  There <br>
is also a disadvantage to going first, since subsequent competitors <br>
know what time (if any) they have to beat.  This disparity is <br>
maximized in a one round contest.  I also agree with Macky that the <br>
nerves that can cause slow times for speedcubists very often cause <br>
total failures for blindfolders.  Multiple rounds are absolutely <br>
necessary, because even the best blindfolders miss every so often.  I <br>
know that Geir Ugelstadt feels the same way on this point.<br>
<br>
In retrospect I can see why cameras were present in the blindfold <br>
booths, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they should have moved around, <br>
particularly during the memorization phase.  Once the blindfold is <br>
on, if they wish to move around quietly, that&#x27;s probably OK.  <br>
<br>
Personally, the presence of noise was not a bother to me.  It was <br>
variations in the noise that mattered.  The sound of 4X4X4&#x27;s hitting <br>
the tables is an example.  A source of white noise to mask the sounds <br>
would have been better than earplugs.  People coming in and out of <br>
blindfold area should be strictly prohibited during each attempt.<br>
<br>
The biggest surprise for me was when Geir Ugelstadt chose to withdraw <br>
from the 3X3X3 competition.  It was my task to allow him to vent upon <br>
his finally realizing that for this competition, the analysis phase <br>
would count towards the total time of the solve.  That choice of <br>
format put him at an insurmountable disadvantage.  For most <br>
blindfolders, the rules that were in effect make perfectly good <br>
sense.  But then again, no one else was trying to apply Jessica&#x27;s <br>
system in a blindfold context, as was Geir.  At present, I do not <br>
know enough about her system to estimate the number of piece <br>
placements that he would have had to correctly calculate in order to <br>
be plan all of his moves.  But certainly, it would have been several <br>
times what I would have used in my system.  It is very audacious for <br>
him (or for that matter, for Gaetan Guimond, possibly others) to <br>
attempt to use a speedcubing system for blindfold use, and I wish <br>
him/them well in his/their efforts.  If both Geir and Gaetan had been <br>
there, we would have been perfectly justified to split the 3X3X3 <br>
blindfold into two events.  Geir and Gaetan would have battled to <br>
create the shortest possible time for the solution phase only, and <br>
the rest of us would have competed in the shortest total time for <br>
both the analysis and solving phase format.  <br>
<br>
Macky is also correct that we blindfolders must organize, and I would <br>
prefer sooner than later.  I feel strongly enough about this that I <br>
might actually do something about it.  (Shock!!)<br>
<br>
I hope that everyone enjoyed the seeing eye blindfold demo prior to <br>
the show on Sunday.  There are several variations to this that we can <br>
discuss if people are interested, perhaps in a separate group.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Dan for putting the competition together.  It was an <br>
privilege to meet you all.<br>
<br>
See you all in 2005.<br>

I may have been a bit unjust at times during the

don&#x27;t bend that anyway they want, which they might,,,i

          <div class="email-content">I can guess one fairly good reason why we had to start/stop the 
timers by placing both hands on the pads, rather than having them 
start/stop when the cube was picked up/put down... if the latter 
mechanism were used then the timer would be stopped every time there 
was a piece pop (as the cubie would fall onto the mat). And as 
anyone at the RWC could tell you, there were quite a few piece pops.

As it was, even if there was a pop and the piece fell onto one of 
the pad circles (where we placed our hands at the start), the timer 
would still keep going.

I think the speedstack timers were a good choice for RWC. I 
discovered that it was also very important that the officials were 
using stopwatches as back-ups. During one of my solves, the stackmat 
didn&#x27;t trigger properly and so my time for that solve was taken from 
the stopwatch.

          <div class="email-content">mm..I recently got a mail from my friend saying that he started 
learning 2-step OLL from Jessica&#x27;s page. I guess I had told him about 
finger short cut and things before, and he asked me for an advice on 
how he should turn OLL 35(H1 in Ron&#x27;s page). I didn&#x27;t know that he 
was learning the algs from Jessica&#x27;s page, so took it to be the 35 I 
knew, which is N12 in Ron&#x27;s page. So, I replied to him with my 
favorite alg for that corner pattern, 37 (The one I knew as 37), 
which is N13 in Ron&#x27;s Page, and 24/25 in Jessica&#x27;s page. So my friend 
looked at 37 in Jessica&#x27;s Page, which is H3 in Ron&#x27;s page and 25 I 
knew, found it totally different from what I gave him, and replied 
with &quot;what the ??&quot; after which I had to existance of JSCC OLL number 
etc...
  Are you following all this? If you are, I guess we don&#x27;t need a 
standardized (or however you spell that) number for OLL&amp;PLL. But if 
you are not (or had to go to four different sites and minimize and 
mazimize each window and scroll up or down every time you read a new 
number in this message), I believe you can understand what I meant in

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the suggestion, Doug.
I used to use letters for PLL too, but now I use JSCC PLL numbering 
system which includes a lowercase letter (f,r,l,b) at the end to show 
the direction of the pattern. It&#x27;s just much easier this way. The 
problem is, only JSCC cubers use the notation...
Well, anyone got any good ideas? I&#x27;d hate to make something that no 
one likes...

Thanks,

(Dan Knights, Jessica Fridrich, Lars Vandenbergh, Mirek Goljan and <br>
more).  The battle went on for hours (&#x27;til 1:30am) and some <br>

using Jasmine`s handy HP iPAQ Pocket PC (shameless plug for my <br>

          <div class="email-content">I am rather against the idea establishing a global standard
numbering.  I have completely no number or code in my head.
I really hate numbers everytime I see them in JSCC mailing-list.

Macky> Well, anyone got any good ideas? I&#x27;d hate to make something that no
Macky> one likes...

Just put a link to gif files that you can find on Ron&#x27;s or Katsu&#x27;s pages.
Prepare all rotational combination if you want everything.

# People putting &lt;img> tags here and there in mail messages
# would be a nightmare for me, though.  Please don&#x27;t!

Here are some of my random thoughts...

OLL Example1: 
  Ron&#x27;s code: H5
    http://www.speedcubing.com/images/tl_h6.gif  (note the number difference!)
  JSCC code: O22
    http://www5.gateway.ne.jp/~katsu-k/ollgazou/22.gif
  Helmsteller coding: [2 1 1 2] [0 0 0 0]
  Ascii-art: (might have problems with fonts)
      _
   | X      | X~
    XXX (or  XXX for saving 2 lines)
   | X      | X_
      ~
     Hmm.. This ascii-art thing works for me.  (I have blue on U-face)
     But people who have white U-faces might think it counter-intuitive.
  Perhaps, arranging Helmsteller coding in 2D might help:
   101    -0-
   000 or 000 or putting three lines as &quot;101/000/202&quot;
   202    +0+
     You cannot directly see whether the U-color of UBR cubie is on B or R.

OLL Example2:
  Ron&#x27;s code: N26
  JSCC code: O47r
  Helmsteller coding: [1 2 2 1] [1 1 0 0]
  Ascii-art:
    _
     X |    ~X |
   | XX    | XX
       |    __ |
    ~~ 
  2d-helmsteller:
    202  +0+
    100  100
    111  -1-


Here&#x27;s another ascii-art.  Do I stick to constant-width font too much?

Indeed, these are two different categories.
Having two contests would be the best solution, however some maximum
time for preparing and analyzing the cube should be set, even if it is
as long as one hour.

Another competition for the most cubes solved blindfolded without a
single error would be cool as well (but it would take very long...)

By the way: I am still searching for an information about Dror&#x27;s
winning time in the blindfold competition. Can anybody help???

          <div class="email-content">Terje,
Mihn Thai&#x27;s record was for a single solve.  The 16.59 was the best 
for a single solve at this WC.  Even if a best of 5 average was used 
to determine the outcome (I don&#x27;t know how it was determined as I was 
ill and left early), there&#x27;s not really an ongoing stat that we as 
speedcubers keep on that.  As far as I know the main stats are best 
solve, and average of 10 (i.e. 12 solves).

For the preliminaries, I wasn&#x27;t even sure why the averages even 
appeared in the official results--in a way, showing them draws 
emphasis away from what not be clear to non-cubers who see the 
results... that the average means nothing, we only needed one good 
time.  If the organizers had wanted us to care about our averages, 
the results of the preliminaries would have been an average of 3 
rather than a best of 3.  If you don&#x27;t buy this arguement, look at 
Jess Bonde.  He placed 6 in the preliminaries and went on to set a 
world record... if we went by averages, he would placed 30th, barely 
qualifying for the next round!

I myself couldn&#x27;t have cared less what my second and third fastest 
times were.  I got one time I was really happy with, and two crappy 
times, and that&#x27;s absolutely fine with me.  I&#x27;ll worry about averages 
for the competitions that are based on them, like the Sunday 
contest.  ;-)

disagrees, I would suggest to try to put an event of this extent <br>
together him/herself. I admired Dan how calm and professional he <br>
stayed the whole time and that he was responsive to the input <br>

possible disciplines and a wide range of puzzles. This championship <br>
was not just about speedcubing of 3x3x3, but much more than that. <br>
Compared to the first championship, there was at least 100 times more <br>
actual cubing than in 1982! Also, the atmosphere was quite friendly <br>
with plenty of space to relax. The timing device felt weird at first <br>
but I learned to like it with time. If anybody has suggestions for <br>
the next event, let&#x27;s discuss this in a creative way. Dan deserves <br>
one big hug and THANK YOU from all of us.<br>
<br>
I was fascinated by Chris Hardwick&#x27;s one handed solving, I admired <br>
the 7y old Victoria Zborowska how she got on the stage and solved the <br>
cube surrounded by a swarm of cameras and journalists with stings, I <br>
absolutely love Lars Petrus&#x27; sense of humor as well as his T-shirt <br>
with an inscription &quot;Front of Shirt&quot; in the front, I was in awe when <br>
I watched Dror Vomberg memorize the cube in 1.5 minutes and then <br>
solve it in another 1.5 minutes, I was stunned to hear that Ron tried <br>
out the pad just twice before the competition - with times in 13&#x27;s <br>
(both unlucky cases) and I am shocked by his latest average of 15.4, <br>
and I was blown away by finger tricks of David Allen. It was a lot of <br>
fun to observe the competition between David Wesley and Masayuki <br>
Akimoto in the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 category, etc, etc, etc. I hope to <br>
post more with the pictures.<br>

All in all, the championship was a wonderful event and definitely a <br>
big success. I got to meet people with incredible skills and finally <br>
see the faces behind cryptic Yahoo nicknames. It felt so weird to see <br>
so many cube-crazy folks all in one room. Also, I have never realized <br>
what noise level can be created when 100+ people start twisting their <br>
cubes at the same time ... <br>
<br>
I just started to sift through the pictures Mirek and I took at the <br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] We should do this more often!<br>
<br>
<br>
  Some hasty thoughts on the weekend before I go away to Nevada for a week...<br>
<br>
  It was of course, by far, the best world championships ever! <br>
  Inevitably some things worked less than perfectly. We&#x27;ll learn from <br>
  those mistakes next time (and make new ones). The important thing is <br>
  that something finally happened. I&#x27;m immensely grateful to Dan G for <br>
  doing that heavy and thankless groundwork. It will be easier for <br>
  those who come after.<br>
<br>
  After having been asked in an interview, I decided that my favorites <br>
  were my fellow Swede David, my fellow San Franciscan Dan, my fellow <br>
  Lars Lars V, and of course my fellow Budapest survivor Jessica. <br>
  Really, I have witnesses! It&#x27;s a little spooky that they took the <br>
  first 4 spots! I&#x27;m especially amused that there was a Lars in fourth <br>
  place again this time, though Lars V may see that differently.<br>
<br>
  My only ambition was to get a result below 25 to feel I had at least <br>
  a decent showing. That seemed unambitious enough, but when I started <br>
  badly, it made me even more nervous. It was only in the second last <br>
  attempt I got 24.99 and could relax a bit for the last attempt and <br>
  get 21.91.<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s weird, that nightmarish feeling when your brain, your hands and <br>
  the cube all seem to move in different time frames, and everything <br>
  jams, and the timer just races away the seconds. I saw it in myself <br>
  and in many other contestants. I guess this was the first competition <br>
  ever for most of the participants, and the first one in 20 years for <br>
  most of the rest, and it showed.<br>
<br>
  Aside from two championships I had barely met speed cubists in person <br>
  before, and it was so much fun. Not only to be among likeminded <br>
  people who would also just spin a cube around mindlessly when talking <br>
  without even being aware of it (the film teams started asking us to <br>
  not do that while being interviewed, since it screws up their sound). <br>
  But also for seeing some things I could not have imagined. I thought <br>
  the most unbelievable ones were David Allens index finger tricks,<br>
  Yes,but you should have seen the Japanese (I don´t know his name) a couple of hours earlier outdoor. I wonder, who has the fastest fingers of the two!<br>
<br>
  R<br>
   <br>
  Chris Hardwick&#x27;s one handed magic, and Dan Knights North Pole jacket.<br>
<br>
  The final was a real intense drama!! I hope someone makes a good TV <br>
  version of it all, that could be a thrilling half hour! One random <br>
  fact no one has mentioned was that Dan Knights fastest time, his <br>
  last, was achieved while putting back a popped piece! I don&#x27;t know if <br>
  anyone keeps track of these things, but i think that 18.76 has to be <br>
  the world record for a popped solve!<br>
<br>
  I was interviewed more times than I can remember, and I didn&#x27;t always <br>
  manage to stop my unfortunate impulse to say whatever outrageous <br>
  thing that amuses me most, rather than more sensible things. So I&#x27;m a <br>
  little worried what the documentaries will do with that. We&#x27;ll see...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Another fun thing late Sunday night (and just before the impromptu 
informal rematch Keith mentioned below) was watching Ron and 
DanH &#x27;teamsolve&#x27; 1 move at a time! I believe they both use a 
cross/F2L/LL method, but from the looks of confusion during the LL I 
assume that they use a few different algs for the last layer.

Their first teamsolve took ~8 minutes and was hilarious to watch as 
they both seemed to attempt to use different LL algs. Their second 
attempt was a much more successful 2 minutes. :)

Teamsolving 1 move at a time was more than my brain was up for at 
midnight after 2 solid days of cubing, so I opted for an easier 
version (ie. teamsolve one alg at a time) with Lars V, Michiel, 
Jasmara and anyone else who happened to walk past the table at the 
time. :)

          <div class="email-content">thank you jessica!

one of my biggest accomplishments was to have you up on the stage 
performing.

you worked through whatever situations you had and you went right up 
there and got second place as a result.

that impressed the heck out of me!!

You&#x27;ll find it here: http://www-

Be sure to get both parts of the link, and you wan&#x27;t find a link off 
my main site. It is zipped for those with slow connection (i.e. me). 
I think around 43 high quality pictures there... Ron has some good 
ones also. (About 1.76MBs)

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
This whole week was wonderful!<br>
<br>
The idea of this world championship started in the 2nd half of 2000 among Dan<br>
Knights, Chris Hardwick, Matt Wilder and me.<br>
But it only came to life when Dan Gosbee took over the organization. He made it<br>
all happen. And it was bigger than we dreamt of. There was even a media hype.<br>
Not only did Dan make it happen, he also did the organization of the event.<br>
Which is a lousy job, because you will always get complaints (rightly or<br>
wrongly). The second day was almost perfect!<br>
We cannot thank you enough, Dan.<br>
<br>
We should also not forget the sponsors: KroegerInc (David Charbonneau and the<br>
other officials), Rubiks.com/Hessport.com (Patrick Hess), SevenTowns (Chrisi and<br>
David and managing director David Kremer). And on the background Hasbro also<br>
played a very very important role. Strategic Objectives (a.o. Stephen) were the<br>
important factor for the media attention.<br>
Thanks to the sponsors!<br>
<br>
Being part of the cubing community is great. It was so much fun to see the faces<br>
behind the nicknames and e-mail addresses. I haven&#x27;t seen one single cubist that<br>
wasn&#x27;t nice. The atmosphere in the hotel was really cool. I wonder what it<br>
looked like to outsiders. Some of us couldn&#x27;t stop playing their cubes, even<br>
when they talked to each other or were in the middle of an interview.<br>
It was also great to see some guys/girls from the old school. Like David Allen<br>
and Gene Means: these two are fantastic cubists. I am sure they would make a lot<br>
of money as street artists. It was intimidating to cube next to them, because<br>
their finger speed is absolutely unequalled.<br>
<br>
I am sure many of you felt that cubing at the WC is much harder than at home on<br>
the sofa. You discover other factors than just your cube, your fingers and your<br>
system.<br>
An important factor is the nerves, where your heart starts bouncing, your<br>
fingers start trembling and your hands feel cold. The cameras and the big<br>
audience made that even worse.<br>
But there was also a lot of eagerness: you want to perform well in front of an<br>
audience, and a lot of cubists started to rush instead of doing their normal<br>
thing.<br>
In the first two rounds this extra pressure was still at a reasonable level. You<br>
only needed to be among the best 32 resp. 8 to qualify for next round. Still<br>
many of us performed (a little) worse than their normal level, but there were<br>
also some contestants who were able to break their personal bests.<br>
The final was completely different because of an extra factor: the idea that<br>
performing well could bring you the world title. I was stunned by the bad times<br>
we all achieved. But I am sure that even if I would have known that before the<br>
final, I still couldn&#x27;t have changed my style to going a little slower. The<br>
pressure just took over.<br>
Dan Knights was the coolest in these difficult circumstances. Congratulations<br>
Dan!<br>
<br>
Also congratulations to David Wesley (3rd, 2nd and 2nd place!!) and Masayuki<br>
Akimoto (the master of the bigger puzzles, using a very interesting system).<br>
<br>
This experience will make a lot of difference for future competitions. I think<br>
the level of the next competition will be much higher. With more good<br>
contestants and better preparation.<br>
I hope the atmosphere will be the same.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone!<br>
Please send me your pictures or post them somewhere on the net.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">First off I&#x27;d like to correct Terje and Adam on Jess Bonde&#x27;s time, 
it was not 16.59s it was 16.53s.

I didn&#x27;t get to see the team solve craze, but I heard that people 
were undoing each other&#x27;s last move, how annoying would that be! it 
wouldn&#x27;t of really worked for me though, since I use a different 
method. The ~8-9 way cube battle / musical chairs with cubes (for 
scrambling) was my favorite part of the whole weekend. I got there a 
bit late. According to Keith it was a showdown between Corners First 
and Fridrich method, I got in there the last half-hour to represent 
a Lars or Lar&#x27;s variant! I think I might have beaten David 
Allen...., uhh ONCE! (Lovin&#x27; his signature trigger.)

Yes, I too am thankful for DanG&#x27;s work on organizing the event. It 
is easy to criticize if you&#x27;ve never been to such a thing before. 
After hearing the opinions of Jessica and Lars (the only two 
returning from Budepest), I think everything ran well... you can&#x27;t 
really plan for something like a timer getting stolen (having it 
would of boosted productivity by 25%). Even though I have little 
interest in the BLD event (besides to watch in amazement), I do 
agree with Macky&#x27;s and Jim&#x27;s opinion on the number of rounds and 
stuff. I don&#x27;t believe they were all told about how there would only 
be one round! But why, oh why, did we have to write down a 
bibliography line if they wern&#x27;t going to read it when your up on 
stage??? (I suppose too many comfilicting/overlaping starts.)

So to sum it up: &#x27;82 was done great for the audience/tv, &#x27;03 was 
done well for the competitors (getting 3 continuous solves as 
opposed to waiting forever in between solves). You just can&#x27;t 
compare, of course this one wasn&#x27;t &#x27;perfect,&#x27; but it&#x27;s infinately 
better then the last! (category-wise)

Yes, I think most of us actually liked the timers, and to quote 
DanG &quot;created complete fairness.&quot; I judged that Jessica had one of 
the hardest time adjusting to it, but in the end, got the hang of it.
I just kept telling people that &quot;your hands should hit the mat 
before the cube does!&quot;

It looked cute and all to have a 7yr old reach way up to grab the 
cube, but somebody really should have given her something to stand 
on (chair, table, higher platform). (did they?, I only watched one 
of here solves)

The whole distraction thing during BLD memorization was complete 
CRAP, no one should of been allowed back there! I have a hard enough 
time doing half of what&#x27;s needed at home in a realxed environment.

I am curious to know of #33 and #34&#x27;s times (sorry about names, but 
beeter not to single anyone out) in the semi-round, they deserve to 
know and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be on the provided spreedsheet.


-Doug (regret not entering 4x4, but just happy to have earned a 
world ranking)

p.s. this whole event has given me tons of new ideas to try, now I 
just need to find a swimming pool, blindfold (no more pulling a 
sweather over my head), 2x2, paraminx, and of course directions to 
go in the quest for humanity&#x27;s ever elusive goal of solving the cube 
rediculously fast... :)

          <div class="email-content">I just wanted to send a post with my story in it, sorry if it seems <br>
redundant but I just couldn&#x27;t believe how awesome last weekend was!  <br>
I am incredibly thankful to Dan G for organizing this event, and for <br>
letting me compete in the 4x4x4 last minute, which held up everyone <br>
before going on to the next round :-(  .  I also have to say that I <br>
liked the timers a lot more than I expected to.  I had practiced the <br>
setup at home before the championships but actually having the timer <br>
there was much cooler.  I have a suggestion, though I have no idea <br>
how this might be done.  Perhaps the speedstack people could <br>
manufacture a &quot;cube&quot; timer that is a much shorter area (maybe a 1ft. <br>
x 1ft. square) instead of the wide rectangular mat for an official <br>
cube timer.  We cube people don&#x27;t need all the space on the sides, <br>
which the cup stacking people need in order to build the three cup <br>
pyramids.  This could be the official timer that they could sell <br>
through the rubiks.com site.  Anyway, just an idea.<br>
<br>
Also I just wanted to say how amazing it was to meet everyone!  I&#x27;m <br>
so used to people around school not really paying attention when I <br>
cube, or asking a couple questions with not a lot of real interest.  <br>
It was amazing to be in the same room with like minded people who <br>
also cube when talking to other people without realizing :)<br>
<br>
I do have to say that it was awesome to race some of the &quot;big names&quot; <br>
in cubing, as well as to see David Allen&#x27;s AMAZING finger tricks!  I <br>
tried to do the same move but couldn&#x27;t even get to a third or a <br>
fourth of his speed :)<br>
<br>
&gt;From my perspective, nerves were a big issue.  I remember having my <br>
knees feel slightly weak while at the timer.  I&#x27;m amazed at all the <br>
people who achieved a sub-20 time under those conditions, especially <br>
the final round!  I was nervous, and I wasn&#x27;t even on stage!  I <br>
can&#x27;t imagine what that must have been like!<br>
<br>
So anyway I thought I was addicted to the cube before the WC but <br>
now, having met other people who are just as interested in the cube, <br>
I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop :)  Last weekend was so incredibly <br>
amazing (thanks so much to Dan G for setting it up!) and I am very <br>
excited and very much looking forward to seeing all of you people, <br>
and hopefully more, in 2005.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It was so cool to see other people doing the one handed!  I get 
weird looks for practicing the cube at school, but even weirder 
looks when people see me doing it one handed :)  It was fun to see 
other people who were also interested in this side aspect of the 
cube.

Yes I do use one handed &quot;finger tricks&quot; though they aren&#x27;t real 
finger tricks in the sense of when you do them two handed.  
Basically my strategy is to use all of my fingers, though I&#x27;m still 
working on incorporating my pinky finger in my cubing, right now I 
just use it to stabilize the cube.

Anyway an example of what I mean by a one handed finger tricks is 
this, hold the cube (left handed) with your thumb on the center 
sticker of the F face.  Hold your middle finger on the center 
sticker of the B face and your ring finger on the B sticker of the 
DBR piece.  Place your index finger on the B sticker of the BUL 
piece.

>From this setup you can do the moves U&#x27;R or RU&#x27; very quickly (for 
one handed).  For the first move flick the U face with your index 
finger, then immediately after it is done turning flick the R turn 
with your ring finger.  For the second move pull the R face with 
your ring finger first, then immediately after it stops turning pull 
the U face with your indx finger.

There are lots of little tricks like this where you can do 2-3 turns 
very quickly in succession.

It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain but easy to show.  Perhaps I can work 
on getting some videos up of what I mean if people are interested.

          <div class="email-content">Dan, I apologize if any of my comments hurt your feelings, as that 
was not my intent.  My intent was totally constructive.  Many of my 
comments are observations that could only be made AFTER my first 
blindfold competition, which was last Saturday.  For example, because 
the blindfold cubists did not communicate AT ALL prior to the event, 
there was no way even for us to know that the 3X3X3 blindfold should 
really have been split into two different categories.  It was only by 
getting us all together that this realization is now possible.  It 
may seem that we are all ganging up against you telling you what you 
could have done better, but that is really not the case at all.  The 
blindfolders who were there now understand each other&#x27;s point of 
view, and are agreeing with each other rather than lobbying you for 
rules that favor their own brand of blindfolding.  This could not 
have happened had you not created an event that would bring a 
significant number of us together.  I am certain that I would not 
have had a chance to meet other blindfolders unless you had organized 
the contest.  There were many other things that happened that I could 
not have anticipated had I been in your shoes, and I am a blindfold 
cubist.  So I can not even blame you for not being one of our 
number.  Knowing the blindfolders that I met, none of them (including 
me) were capable of making the event happen.  We are just recording 
our suggestions for next time now, while they are still fresh in our 
minds.  I hope this helps.  I said it in my prior posting, but I had 
best say it again.  &quot;Thanks to Dan for putting the competition 
together.&quot;

          <div class="email-content">Thanks again Dan G. for making this happen.  You are the MAN!<br>
<br>
I had such an amazing time -- everyone was wonderful.  The best part <br>
of the entire weekend, the part that I will remember forever, was the <br>
fun I had meeting all of the other &quot;cube-geeks&quot; from around the <br>
world.  I think everyone was just happy to finally be in the presence <br>
of other speed-cubers!  We had so much fun racing eachother on Sunday <br>
night at the hotel bar.  It&#x27;s too bad we can&#x27;t to it all the time.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been competing in other sports for many years, and I&#x27;ve never <br>
been to a competition with so much mutual support between the <br>
competitors.  Whenever we weren&#x27;t competing, we were hanging out <br>
swapping algorithms and sharing techniques.  Everyone I met was very <br>
friendly.<br>
<br>
I agree that the finals really came down to a mental competition.  <br>
All of the finalists can beat 20.00 in our sleep, yet none of us <br>
could do it under those high-pressure circumstances.  I did a lot of <br>
public cubing in the last year, including street-performing in San <br>
Francisco.  I think this and my meditation, yoga, and hypnosis work <br>
helped me recover faster from the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response (as Ron <br>
said, fast heartbeat, cold hands, loss of concentration).  By the way <br>
Ron, if you get cold hands like I do, I suggest wearing a big winter <br>
jacket next time! ;)<br>
<br>
I also want to acknowledge all of the really fast speedcubists who <br>
competed.  People like Ron, Lars Vandenbergh, Gene Means and David <br>
Allen, Jess Bonde, David Wesley, Jessica Fridrich, Andy Camann, Jon <br>
Morris, Adam Géhin (who couldn&#x27;t come), and others, are all very fast <br>
too.  A few of you are even faster than me at home, and I would <br>
especially like to acknowledge Ron who obtained a LEGENDARY average <br>
of 15.4 seconds at home before the championship.  Congrats also to <br>
Jess Bonde with the new fastest single time in competition of 16.53.<br>
<br>
So, the cube is back.  Popularity will only increase after all of the <br>
publicity surrounding the championships.  And we are on the verge of <br>
a breakthrough in world of speedcubing.  Ron, David Wesley, and Andy <br>
Camann have already begun to push the barriers.  All of us using the <br>
Fridrich method were in awe of David Allen and Gene Means when we saw <br>
their cube handling techniques.  I&#x27;m still not convinced that this <br>
style of &quot;finger-pushing&quot; (as Jess Fridrich called it) is good for <br>
competition settings, but it is certainly fast for use at home.  Now <br>
we all have 2 years to improve our solution methods and work on <br>
steeling our nerves!  Let&#x27;s get some REAL averages in 2005!<br>

          <div class="email-content">What an AMAZING WEEKEND!!<br>
<br>
As I mentioned to many of you, RWC2003 was part of a month-long Nth <br>
American holiday for me. I&#x27;m flying back to Australia in 2 days and <br>
I can now say that of all the things I&#x27;ve done/seen on this trip, <br>
the Championships was BY FAR the highlight. Originally, I thought of <br>
RWC as something that I was just fitting into my trip, but I had <br>
such a fantastic time that I&#x27;m now thinking that I might aim to <br>
organise future holidays to coincide with international cubing <br>
events! (seriously!)<br>
<br>
Living in Canberra, Australia, I think I probably travelled the <br>
greatest distance to get to the competition. Canberra doesn&#x27;t have <br>
an international airport so I first flew to Sydney where I caught an <br>
Air New Zealand flight which went to LA via Auckland NZ, then I got <br>
a flight from LA to Washington DC (my initial destination for this <br>
holiday). I spent approximately 30 hours straight in airports and on <br>
planes -- that was just getting to DC, then later in the month took <br>
another flight to Toronto (which went via Detroit). So, eventually <br>
getting to Toronto meant well over 30 hours in airports/on planes, <br>
flying with 4 different airlines, and going through 7 different <br>
airports (Canberra, Sydney, Auckland, LA, DC, Detroit, Toronto). No <br>
one can say that I&#x27;m not committed to cubing!! :)<br>
<br>
Despite the huge amount of travelling it took to get to RWC, it was <br>
definitely worth it. It was such a wonderful thing to be a part <br>
of. :) Prior to the competition, there were two things that I was <br>
hoping to get out of the weekend: (i) achieve some good personal <br>
times (even if my times were a long way off those of the <br>
superspeedcubers); and (ii) meet the people behind the emails here.<br>
<br>
On the first point, I was pretty happy with how I went. For the <br>
3x3x3 qualification round, my average was a few seconds faster than <br>
most of my recent averages. For the 4x4x4, I got a personal best in <br>
the time trials. I entered the Clock event at the last minute and <br>
was quite happy with my result there too. :)<br>
<br>
As it turned out, point (ii) was the best part of the weekend. There <br>
were just so many really nice people. Everyone was so friendly and <br>
supportive and positive. It was so inspiring that everyone was so <br>
happy to share ideas, algs, advice with everyone else. I feel that I <br>
made some really good friends over the weekend. :) I miss you guys <br>
already!<br>
<br>
Thanks to DanG for making it all possible!!<br>

PS. Peter took heaps of high resolution photos over the weekend. It <br>
may be a little while before we get around to making low res <br>
versions for the web. I&#x27;ll let you all know when they&#x27;re online. :)<br>

I had a blast at the Championships, and was happy to meet so many <br>
fellow cubists.  I posted some of my pictures (the ones that turned <br>
out ok anyway)in the album section of Speed Solving club.  The album <br>

Ok guyz,<br>
<br>
The Champs were _awesome_.  I now have the urge to learn speedsolving the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 and maybe more...  It&#x27;s so amazing how much faster you can improve when your with fellow &#x27;cubers&#x27;.  I had a great time, especially watching Master Katsu, Chris (one hand), Ron, Jessica, and _everyone_ with such different styles.  It was really a 10 out of 10 experience.  I still have pics to load, but, i don&#x27;t have them yet...  I also have more ideas in getting faster by : GETTING A DECENT CUBE (thnx to Heath for letting use his backup, cuz mine really was __bad__.).  I really had one of the worst cubes around!  it was amazing seeing all these &#x27;loooose&#x27; cubes around.  new ideas are just FLOWING.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I got a 5x5 at WC, and yes, I have solved it twice.  The first <br>
time it took about 5 hours split in 2 days, second try, over 3 hours.<br>
<br>
As you can tell, I don&#x27;t fully understand the cube. <br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s what I am trying to do.  <br>
<br>
I generally follow Chris&#x27;s method for the 4x4 on the 5x5:<br>
 <br>
Solve all centers<br>
Pair edges<br>
Solve as 3x3.<br>
<br>
The problem is this:<br>
<br>
While pairing the edges, I can get the first 8 of them completed.<br>
<br>
I put all &quot;paired&quot; (or tripled for that matter)edges in the top and <br>
bottom layers, filling up all of the slots. <br>
<br>
What is a good logical way to solve the last 4?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve looked all over the net, and I don&#x27;t understand what is expected <br>
when solving these.<br>
<br>
Can anyone give me a link to something that easily explains this the <br>
way Chris H does in his Revenge Solution?  Or at least try to explain <br>
this to me.<br>

Any help is greatly appreciated<br>

you could use the alg for solving the last two, off of chris&#x27;s 
revenge site...sorry this may not be much help, but im in a hurry 
lol.

cant wait for 2005

          <div class="email-content">It was really weird when I did a pretty good but not excellent time 
one handed, but everyone was really impressed by it. I think the 
reason I did good was just because not many people practice one 
handed.
I hope you get some vids up, I couldn&#x27;t see you very well on the 
stage.
That finger trick will take ages to get used to, but I&#x27;m going to 
practice it a lot.

Yes I do use one handed &quot;finger tricks&quot; though they aren&#x27;t real 
finger tricks in the sense of when you do them two handed.  
Basically my strategy is to use all of my fingers, though I&#x27;m still 
working on incorporating my pinky finger in my cubing, right now I 
just use it to stabilize the cube.

Anyway an example of what I mean by a one handed finger tricks is 
this, hold the cube (left handed) with your thumb on the center 
sticker of the F face.  Hold your middle finger on the center 
sticker of the B face and your ring finger on the B sticker of the 
DBR piece.  Place your index finger on the B sticker of the BUL 
piece.

>From this setup you can do the moves U&#x27;R or RU&#x27; very quickly (for

finger, then immediately after it is done turning flick the R turn 
with your ring finger.  For the second move pull the R face with 
your ring finger first, then immediately after it stops turning pull 
the U face with your indx finger.

There are lots of little tricks like this where you can do 2-3 turns 
very quickly in succession.

It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain but easy to show.  Perhaps I can work 
on getting some videos up of what I mean if people are interested.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, it was awesome! I&#x27;ve solved the 5x5x5 already, it took me half 
an hour though. My method, which is the same as everyone else in the 
world&#x27;s for big cubes, is very simple but very slow. It&#x27;s the common 
centers then edges then big 3x3x3 method.
I&#x27;ve worked out a plan for the 3x3x3. Heath and probably a few 
others already use it, but here&#x27;s how it works:
The Petrus method orients the edges during the F2L, and that usually 
takes 5-10 moves for me. If I don&#x27;t orient them, but just complet 
the F2L as is, then I can learn the orientation algs and still solve 
a two-look LL. It should cut about 3-5 seconds off, eventually. 
Hopefully within two years. :)
BTW, Brent, this is Mike. The one from Idaho that you met. Just to 
let you know. LOL

          <div class="email-content">Oh yeah, at first my arm/wrist/hand was sooo sore. You can imagine 
how sore it was during the WC, when I did it about 20 times a day to 
practice.
But you just need to do it often. It takes a lot more dexterity for 
one handed. I&#x27;ve heard about these chinese ball things that you 
manipulate in your hands to strengthen them. So do anything 
requiring dexterity to practice.
One thing that I did, but didn&#x27;t consider to be dexterity improving 
until I got into it, was magic. Card sleights, and &#x27;flourishes&#x27; as 
they&#x27;re called, help a /ton/. That coin knuckle rolling thing is not 
only helpful, but it&#x27;s fun and impressive. I can do it on both hands 
(at once), and two coins at once on my left hand.
If you want to learn card stuff for dexterity practice, visit 
www.superhandz.com and www.handlordz.com.

          <div class="email-content">Same with me (but opposite). It&#x27;s weird, but I mainly hold the cube 
with my left hand and do all the twisting with my right. Very 
strange.
And when I&#x27;m doing magic, I hold the cards in my left hand, but I do 
most of the sleights in my right. I can do a one handed fan reeaally 
well in my right hand, but not quite so well with my left.

          <div class="email-content">(sorry for all these posts!)
Do you lube your cube at all? If you do it more, then you could 
probably lower your times a lot, perhaps average sub-20 soon. Just 
an idea.

And I was also inspired to learn basically all of the puzzles well 
enough to compete next time. I&#x27;m planning on being the Jack of All 
Trades but the Master of None (except the 3x3x3). LOL I&#x27;m going to 
get a magic, master magic, and a megaminx, and eventually a clock.
Good luck with the lubing!

interviews?<br>
<br>
Being one of the few female cubers, pretty much every media person <br>
there asked me questions like &quot;why do you think there are so few <br>
female speedcubers?&quot; and &quot;what is it like to be a female cuber in a <br>
competition dominated by males?&quot; I didn&#x27;t really have any good <br>
answers for these questions. I love puzzles, so it&#x27;s not easy for me <br>
to come up with reasons why other people don&#x27;t. As for the second <br>
question, I was just happy to meet other cubers, didn&#x27;t matter if <br>
they were male or female.<br>
<br>
I never thought of cubing as a gender-specific activity, but the <br>
number of males vs females in this group and at the competition <br>
suggests that perhaps it is?<br>
<br>
What sort of questions was everyone else asked? I mean, besides the <br>
usual ones (eg. Why are you obsessed by cubing? How long have you <br>
been cubing? What sort of preparation have you done for the <br>
competition? etc. etc.)<br>

--------
I only write with my left hand.  But when it comes to throwing, 
bowling, 
golfing, batting, hammering and many other physical 
sports/activities, I am right-handed. 
 
I find that in cubing, I use my left hand for most slice turns, but I 
do alternate to the right hand when necessary.  My right performs 
middle slices flips, finger tricks, etc, better than my left hand.

In the Jeff Geotz article, it mentioned that speedcubist tend to be 
left-handed like chessplayers.  I also happen to modestly be a decent 
chessplayer.  In fact, I took up cubing because it was more of a 
single-player thinking game, than a two-player game.  It gets hard to 
find really good chessplayers at my skill level that are actually 
willing to play.  I do play anyone when the opportunity arises - 
novice or master.

Most people would consider me left-handed because I write with my 
left hand.  Some people call me ambidextrous because I do a lot other 
things with my right hand.

Always Cubing,
Duane Cash

          <div class="email-content">Like everyone else, I had a wonderful time. The best thing was just <br>
to meet all the different people, putting faces to all the names I <br>
see here (too many to mention) and in the twisty forum (Sandy, <br>
Carter, Oscar, Darren, etc).<br>
[Note: rest of post is repeat of my post on the twisty forum]<br>
<br>
As for the competitions, they were fun too despite the slightly <br>
chaotic first day. I didn&#x27;t take part in the 3x3x3, but instead went <br>
for the easier events, Rubik&#x27;s Magic, Rubik&#x27;s Magic Master Edition, <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Clock, and Pyraminx. I had actually only practised and <br>
planned for the Magics, the other two were a last minute decision. I <br>
hadn&#x27;t touched a clock or a pyraminx in a year. I didn&#x27;t really <br>
deserve to win at the clock, as I messed up and had a bad time (39 <br>
secs) but there were few participants in it. The Magics on the other <br>
hand were more competitive events, and hard to win.<br>
<br>
It is strange how being up on stage in a real competition affects <br>
your mind. For example, during the inspection time for the pyraminx I <br>
checked which face was which colour and how to turn the corners. The <br>
moment the timer started running and I picked it up, my mind went <br>
completely blank, and I had forgotten the colours of the faces again. <br>
On the clock I did so badly that I messed up the first side while <br>
solving the second, so I in fact had to solve three sides instead of <br>
two. At least with the magics there is no thinking involved and you <br>
can do it by rote.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I picked up three prizes, each consisting of a signed wc2003 <br>
rubik&#x27;s cube, a signed photo, a framed Hungarian stamp with the cube <br>
on, and a cheque for 500 Canadian dollars. I think I must have won <br>
the most for the least effort of anyone there.<br>
<br>
All in all it was a great week.<br>

          <div class="email-content">As far as I know, Singmaster came up with Rs for the &quot;slice&quot; move 
RL&#x27;, and Ra for the &quot;anti-slice&quot; RL. For cube rotations he often uses 
italics, but I prefer Rc for a cube rotation in the direction of an R 
face turn (what you call r) because it is clearer and can be used on 
cubes of any size. I use Rm for a turn of the middle slice in the 
direction of R.

So Rc=RmRs=L&#x27;RmR etcetera.

In my opinion we don&#x27;t really need Rs since it was only invented to 
notate a middle layer slice turn without moving the centres.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
I was sort of an anomaly here. I am not a speed cubist, I am a cube <br>
artist.. I came here hoping that more would come to exhibit. The <br>
area in front of the auditorium, where the competitions were held, <br>
was reserved with this purpose in mind, but I was the only one <br>
exhibiting.  This gave me a jolt, because people also told me that <br>
they have never seen anything like thisso many cubes I came here <br>
with 20 percent conviction that I just may be the only one in the <br>
world, who is doing 3d designs. Now that I am back home, that <br>
conviction has risen to 80 percent.  If even here, at this high <br>
international forum, no one can give me the name and contact info of <br>
a person who can do it, then that meansthat meansI may be the only <br>
one.  Guinness was  not here, so I could not talk to them to  find <br>
out if I qualify for their `rare skills category&#x27;, or whatever they <br>
call it. Too bad, I have to try reaching them. But how? Can anyone <br>
offer any suggestions?<br>
<br>
I am very grateful to people who helped me with my 345 design cubes, <br>
spanning 3 designs. David C. (forgive me, but I will never master <br>
the spelling of your last name) came to me at the airport in Toronto <br>
and took us and the cubes to the Crowne Plaza Hotel. I set up my <br>
designs in the Science Center on Friday afternoon and Saturday <br>
morning. On Saturday evening I learned, that the Championship is <br>
moving to a different venue within the Science Center. The timers, <br>
tables, everything had to go. Of course, my designs had to go, also. <br>
How am I going to move 3245 cubes in a timely manner, I worried. <br>
Another person saved the exhibit and my sanity. His name is Janos <br>
Kovacs. He bundled my designs (which I collapsed into cubical <br>
structures) and tied them up into boxes by a very clever way. The <br>
designs were delivered to the venue intact.  And I  set them up <br>
easily. He has my deep gratitude. <br>
<br>
Finally, there is Grant Tregay. He and his wife drove in his car <br>
from Chicago to Toronto, so they had to drive back.. Since I also <br>
live in the Chicago area, I asked him to take a suitcase full of <br>
cubes with him in his car, and I would pick it up. He said he had <br>
enough room in his car, no problem. Thanks, a lot, Grant and Betty. <br>
(For the inquiring minds, the number of cubes in that suitcase was  <br>
243.)<br>
There is a lesson to be learned here: I should have taken fewer <br>
cubes.. But I wanted to show my best. Fewer cubes mean less <br>
interesting designs.  But what if there us another venue change? <br>
Next time Mr. Kovacs may not be around with his clever ideas and his <br>
willingness and ability to help. What then? (BTW, Mr Kovacs is an <br>
Executive Manager of the Rubik Studio in Budapest, Hungary. His boss <br>
is Mr, Rubik.)<br>
In spite of those problems, it was a great weekend.. I have never <br>
seen so many people twiddling the cube in one place. Congratulations <br>
to the winners. And thanks, Dan, for making this event possible. <br>
Also, I understand perfectly that this was a speed cubing event. <br>
Perhaps if there were more cube artists present, they could help <br>
each other out. Speed cubing is not the same as cube art. Speed <br>
cubists take much less cubes than cube artists. Technically, a speed <br>
cubist needs only one cube. A cube artist requires tens, perhaps <br>
hundreds of Rubik&#x27;s cubes.<br>

&gt; You should be able to get down to two unsolved pairs, and then then <br>
&gt; you could use the alg for solving the last two, off of chris&#x27;s <br>
&gt; revenge site...<br>
<br>
Actually, you can use that alg for all of the last 4 sets of edges, <br>
but it&#x27;s a bit more time consuming than necessary.  Basically, while <br>
you still have 3 or more mismatched sets of edges, do this:<br>
- Put one mismatched edge set into FL<br>
- Put another into FR such that a slice move will align a new pair<br>
- Put a third onto either U or D (we just need it not to be in either <br>
BL or BR)<br>
- Do the slice move to make the new pair<br>
- Replace the new pair with the still-mismatched edge from U or D... <br>
Be sure not to mess up the centers in the process - use something <br>
like R U R&#x27; or F&#x27; D2 F for this purpose.<br>
- Reverse the slice move (to fix the centers)<br>
<br>
With this, you can get down to just 2 sets left.  Make sure that <br>
along the way you don&#x27;t undo something that you did previously.  When <br>
you&#x27;re down to the last two, use the alg previously mentioned from <br>
Chris Hardwick&#x27;s page:<br>
  http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step2.html<br>
  d² R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F d²<br>
<br>
Or, you can do it the way I like to:<br>
- Line up the edges in FL and FR (instead of using BR)<br>
- Apply this sequence: d (R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U y&#x27;) (R&#x27; U R) d&#x27;<br>
<br>
His alg is shorter, but I find this much easier for speed <br>
applications.  If you prefer, d and d&#x27; can be replaced by u&#x27; and u, <br>
respectively.  Also, d and u (lowercase) can be taken to mean either <br>
slice only or both face and slice - it is unimportant.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The Rubik&#x27;s Clock is actually easier than it first appears. When you 
get the hang of it I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll come to this conclusion too!  :)

I entered the Clock at the last minute. Like Jaap, I hadn&#x27;t done any 
preparation for it (I never planned on entering and so I didn&#x27;t even 
bring my Clock to Toronto). When I saw how few competitors there 
were for that category I thought &quot;why not enter? I might go okay&quot;. I 
surprised myself by coming 2nd! I think Lars V (who came 3rd in the 
Clock), also just entered at the last minute and without any 
preparation.

I suspect there will be far more people in the Clock event next 
time, and that much faster times will be achieved.  :)

Did you know that Ambidextrous is Latin for &#x27;two right hands&#x27; or

          <div class="email-content">I reckon larger hands really makes a difference. Maybe this is why 
there are no one-handed female cubers?

I&#x27;ve given it a go, but I find it quite difficult and too much of a 
strain on my wrists (even though my cube is super-loose). I&#x27;d 
probably have to use a smaller size cube if I was going to do it.

          <div class="email-content">I think the reason why most everyone uses their left hand for one-
handed is because of two reasons.  #1 being your used to mostly 
holding the cube in your left hand and just using your right for 
moves basically, so your used to holding it with your left for one-
handed.  #2 is the sides of the cube you are used to seeing while 
speedsolving, your used to holding it with your left hand so your 
used to seeing the right side and its easier to recognize the 
situations from that side possibly.  

I know this is a poll for lefties, but im just adding my 2cents :P..
im right handed in everything, but i one-hand cube with my left hand 
(i can also shoot pool left, but im better w/ my right).

...cant wait for 2005

          <div class="email-content">I hope you are being sarcastic. I am sorry if that made me seem like 
I was singling myself out (I processed the data so maybe I get that 
right...). All I did was follow a very simple rule (top 10 of any 
ranking highlighted), and I did get a good time (20.36) on round 1 
among the other people in the bottom half of the 32 qualifiers. Your 
best time out of all 6 attempts was 23.32. So it is not nice of you 
to criticize someone who performed slightly better then you, average-
wise too. But you are welcome to come up with some REASONABLE scheme 
that showcases..., say French cubists for instance.

Ok, maybe a bit hasty, your official ranking is higher, but I got 
better averges in both rounds. Whatever, lets all just LET IT GO. 
The times get a bit meaningless when you stare at them too long, 
especially so few of them. (Using the sample size and computing 
standard deviations and stuff there actaully is a very, VERY 
terrible confidence interval for one person actaully being better 
then another based on the &quot;offical rankings.&quot; That&#x27;s not to say that 
any of you should go do a statistical anaysis on that stuff :).)

Either way Dan Knights rocks!

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s an interesting point. I think I might have some of the

little practice, but was really sore after. Well moving a ton of 
stuff back into the dorms and solving a stif new 5x5x5 for speed in

I was the only Chinese cubists there (didn&#x27;t see any Korean cubists 
either) and statistically we have smaller hand sizes. These two 
aspects might be have some corrolation... I think it&#x27;s not just hand 
size, but how you use them!

Btw, I am right-handed but use left-hand for the one-handed stuff. I 
think it has to do with the left one being my better griping hand. 
Becomming more ambidexterous everyday now thanks to the cube. I 
found the U&#x27;R and RU&#x27; stuff Chris talked about is very useful.

          <div class="email-content">About cramped hands, when I first started doing one handed cubing I 
literally could only do maybe 2-3 solves a day, on my loose cube.  
My hand would cramp up and my wrists would just feel sore 
afterward.  It helps to do finger stretches before you start and 
between solves, you can just look up hand stretches or things like 
that on google.  Also, just practicing a lot helps your hand to be 
able to last longer without tiring out.  When I first started, I 
think 9 months ago, my hand would tire out near the end of the first 
solve, but now I can do an average of 10 all in a row.  It&#x27;s all 
about lots and lots of practice to build your hand strength.

job organizing this event and his willingness to include so many<br>
competitions and categories so that everybody would be pleased having<br>
his or her chance to win. It?s not that I don?t criticize anything<br>
(like going behind the schedule on Saturday) because I?m one of the<br>
winners in one of the competitions but because I can imagine how tough<br>
it must have been for Dan to find compromises while trying to make the<br>
championship the best he could. <br>
Some of us wouldn?t even believe until the last moment that the second<br>
world championship would become reality. This thing, along with some<br>
of us ;-), just waited 21 years for somebody strong and determined ? a<br>
cubelover Dan G. Thank you, Dan, and thank you for doing it this year. <br>
I didn?t win the 40-and-up age speedcubing category only because I?m<br>
that fast but more because the championship was not postponed one more<br>
year. Notice that three of 8 finalists are 39! My luck! J I think this<br>
year was the right year. I didn?t know before that there was an<br>
advantage of getting older J. BTW, when the first championship took<br>
place in Budapest 1982 I thought I was somewhat old to play with the<br>
cube (being 22 years old) but now I do not think I am that old.<br>
What to say more? It was incredible experience to meet people who<br>
traveled hundred of miles to half way around the globe to meet and<br>
compete with other cubists and puzzle solvers. Thanks all who came and<br>
who enjoyed this gathering and thank to the sponsors.<br>
The most incredible and unexpected things I?ve seen? <br>
Somebody solving the cube<br>

          <div class="email-content">WC 2003 was pretty amazing. I must admit I also had <br>
some doubt that a WC would ever take place, but after<br>
20 years there was a major influence with the internet<br>
and of course Dan Gosbee&#x27;s determination.<br>
<br>
This was like all the regional and country _and_ World<br>
championships all rolled into one tournament. It was<br>
a little chaotic but highly enjoyable. <br>
<br>
To put the speed of the cubists in some perspective<br>
I noticed in the qualifier the top 13 people solved the<br>
cube in under 20 seconds at least once. It also seemed<br>
that the Fridrich method was the method of choice <br>
for most competitors.<br>
<br>
My prediction before the tournament was either<br>
Jessica Fridrich, Dan Knight or David Allen would<br>
win the tournament, but Dan proved best when the<br>
pressure was on. Also David Wesley was very<br>
consistent for all 3 sizes of cube.<br>
<br>
I thought there was a slim chance that Erno Rubik<br>
himself might show up at the very end but Janos Kovacs<br>
told me later on that Professor Rubik was a little tired<br>
of travelling. <br>
<br>
I had a brief chat with Jessica and she confirmed what<br>
I pretty much had already discovered, that the working<br>
corner method was slower than combining edge pairs.<br>
Even so I think the extended Varasano method used<br>
by Gene Means and David Allen is still competitive with<br>
the Fridrich method. Marc Waterman himself used a <br>
corner starter system. Bob Peters started with the<br>
Varasano method and probably a few others used some<br>
other variation.<br>
<br>
All in all a great tournament, and I enjoyed meeting the<br>
other cubists. Next time I think I will give some other<br>
puzzles a try, like 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, or perhaps the <br>
clock. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I have one more tiny question.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve solved all of the edges, except that for one of them, the center <br>
edge is flipped.  I know that this is the parity, but I&#x27;m not sure <br>
how to solve it, and again, I cant find anything on the net.  You&#x27;d <br>
be suprised how little info you can find about the 5x5 on the <br>

&gt; Can someone just give me the algorithm for this edge fix?<br>
<br>
Sure... It&#x27;s actually the same one as the fix for having one edge <br>
flipped on the 4x4x4.  This is from Chris&#x27; page at<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step3.html :<br>
  r² B² U² l U² r&#x27; U² r U² F² r F² l&#x27; B² r²<br>
<br>
Again, as long as you do this before solving like a 3x3x3 (or at <br>
least with only F2L solved and LL on U), the lower case letters (all <br>
r and l) can be taken as either slice only or both slice and face.  <br>
If the cube is solved except for that one edge, it&#x27;s got to be just <br>
slice moves.  Either way, hold the cube with the messed up edge at UF.<br>

Well... I didn&#x27;t hear for sure that it was decided, but I did hear <br>
two rumors about possible locations - Florida or Australia.  I&#x27;d say <br>

          <div class="email-content">I was thinking the other day about cube workload.  Now...I know this <br>
might sound ridiculous to some people...but I think that it needs <br>
investigation...<br>
<br>
I find that it take me awhile to warm up for the day on the 3x3x3, <br>
sometimes 30 solves or so...but after about 60 or 70 solves, I <br>
definitely start losing something...<br>
<br>
What would you say your average number of solves was, per day, two <br>
months from the WC?  In the last month, leading up to the <br>
championship?  <br>
<br>
Did you &quot;taper&quot;, as one would in many sports...or did you just solve <br>
and solve and solve...trying to learn new algorithms and new <br>
techniques?<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sure many of you have heard of concepts like periodization of <br>
training, and overtraining...when an athlete is overtrained, there is <br>
a definite loss of coordination...and our sport is all about <br>
coordination...<br>
<br>
I would be interested in hearing about the work load of the fast <br>
cubists...like...how did Dan K&#x27;s compare to someone like Katsu...<br>
<br>
I would imagine that once someone was in Toronto, it was just cube <br>
and cube and cube and cube?  do you think it was good for optimum <br>
performance to do that?  or is solving the cube a hundred times a day <br>
for someone that is used to that, irrelevent? does anyone that <br>
competed feel they might have been overtrained...to the point where <br>
they had lost their zip...or their rhythm?  or was it ALL nerves?<br>
<br>
What is the optimum number of solves per day?<br>
<br>
Should that load be cycled?<br>
<br>
Back in around 1984, I used to average over 500 solves a day during <br>
the summer( yes, all day, everyday) ...with the watch...recording <br>
each one...now I average about 100 a day, including some work on <br>
particular algs...<br>

          <div class="email-content">It does take me a while to warm up. The second day of the WC, I was 
a bit worried because when I got up I couldn&#x27;t get under 30. But 
then I finally got there.
I would say that it&#x27;s not a good idea to go over 100 solves per day, 
due to wrist injuries. I usually do about 60 two handed solves, and 
maybe 10-20 one handed per day.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
How I envy all of the people that were able to make it to Toronto!<br>
<br>
You all know each other now...and I feel like an outsider ;-)<br>
<br>
I knew the weekend would be difficult, because I wasn&#x27;t going to be <br>
there...but it was much worse than I thought.  I spent most of it <br>
scanning the net constantly, hoping for information...a lot of time <br>
in the Chatroom, checking Ron&#x27;s site, checking this group, checking <br>
the french group...etc.<br>
<br>
On Saturday afternoon, a few of us had an alternative &quot;world <br>
championship&quot; in the chatroom...won by Dave O. ;-)22 seconds, if I <br>
recall correctly...<br>
<br>
Eventually, some information started trickling in...I think the best <br>
early info was on the French group (and Ron&#x27;s pictures)...Sunday I <br>
was still glued to the computer...watching the clock...who won?...a <br>
great need to find out what was happening...<br>
<br>
Eventually, I had results...and studied them...and wondered ...<br>
would I have had a chance to reach the round of 32, with all of the <br>
pressure of cubing in public?  <br>
<br>
I will never know...<br>
<br>
Some of the emotions have not subsided this week...I have enjoyed  <br>
every report...every picture...and the envy and depression has grown<br>
;-)<br>
<br>
I will not miss the next WC...whenever it is...<br>
<br>
Great job everyone!  Thanks for all the reports and pictures! I hope <br>
this is all just the beginning!  <br>

The next ones are in 2005, in Florida. Apparently there is a big

          <div class="email-content">To delubricate it, you could try putting it in water. Then you&#x27;ll 
probably need to lube it again. But at least it won&#x27;t be so loose.

          <div class="email-content">There is a big difference between tightness and smoothness. A cube 
can be tight and smooth at the same time (favored by the forceful

no springs or screws that can be adjusted, I don&#x27;t see how to 
tighten a 2x2. Perhaps puzzle builders like Ton could offer a better

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s true. But if a cube is badly lubricated and loose, then it 
might work just as well, or worse, or better, or something.

Sorry you missed the WC, was looking forward to meeting you after 
seeing all of your solves on Jess&#x27; timer.

I was averaging about 100-120 timed solves a day for the last 8 weeks 
leading up to the competition.  I slowed down to about 50 solves for 
the last few days but went berserk on Friday when I arrived in 
Toronto.

Everyone had a cube.  We solved constantly, in the hotel, walking 
down the streets of Toronto, and even raced while going up the 
elevator at the CN Tower.

Unfortunately, I overdid it and by Sunday morning my right index 
finger was toast.

I took 3 days off now that the competition is over and just now 
started turning the cube slowly.  Still have some minor pain but I 
think it will be fine in a few days.

So, Yes, I think I practiced too much on Friday and Saturday (My 
trial runs were at 6PM on Saturday) and that hurt my times some.  But 
the pressure of the competition was the real problem.  I don&#x27;t even 
know how to prepare for it.  Heart was beating, mind was racing, 
hands were clammy... everything you don&#x27;t want when speedsolving.  

My strategy for 2005 is to get my average down to 12 seconds before 
the event so when I cave to the pressure I&#x27;ll possibly still be sub 
20 ;)

See you then...

Keith Out!

          <div class="email-content">My brother and I got a lot of compliments on our 5x5x5&#x27;s at the WC, 
which I learned are &#x27;Bandelows&#x27; (sp?) (Bandelow was it&#x27;s distributor 
but I think it was originally made by Arxon).

I don&#x27;t have any secret but there&#x27;s a few things I can think of.

1) Work in your cube.  We bought our cubes in &#x27;95 and I remember
that it used to be stiff but isn&#x27;t any more.

2) Lube your cube.  As you&#x27;ve mentioned.

3) If you&#x27;re lucky enough you can remove the centre caps without 
hurting yourself and adjust the tightness of the screws.  I try to 
find that fine balance between too many lock-ups and too many piece 
pops (including those centre-corners).

Yes, that is actually my preferred hand stretch before I start 
solving and in between each solve.  Basically just bend one finger 
down and try to bend all your other fingers up.  Do this for each 
finger one at a time.  You can really feel it loosen up the 
tightness in your hand and it helps a lot, in my opinion.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know what your talking about. First off, I think it&#x27;d be 
great to standardize the following terminology for the 5x5: call the 
segmented edges, edge triples instead of edge pairs (this could be 
reserved for the 4x4 or a 5x5 edge minus the very middle one).

If I&#x27;m reading this correctly it seems that at your level, you could 
do something as simple as a monoflip of on central edge piece and 
then turn the face to get to the other one and undo the monoflip on 
it. I amd assuming you mean that you have two middle edges flipped, 
similar problems could use a similar solution unless it is one or 
both of the two possible parity problems. Here is an example:

Suppose you have two edges (small middle ones) flipped on U face, 
speciffically let&#x27;s say UF and UB (tell by the adjacent edges, if 
there is an odd number of such then you have one of the parity 
problems that this will not fix). Then something like MD2M&#x27;DMD&#x27;M&#x27;-U2-
MDM&#x27;D&#x27;MD2M&#x27;-U2 should work. (Here I use everybody else&#x27;s meaning of 
M instead of my own inverted preference, M is turning the middle 
slice behind L cw.)

Parity Problem #1, if two non-central edges are flipped relative to 
the middle one, I use Akimoto&#x27;s alg... say they&#x27;re on DFl and DFr... 
I get them opposite each other on the left slice by somthing like 
(Rr)^2(Ff)^2(Rr)^2 (undo this at the end)... Then perform r&#x27;(D2r&#x27;)^4-
(F2lB2l&#x27;)^2. I showed my roommate David Wesley at Toronto and he 
immediately recognized it as Akimoto&#x27;s... I cubed with him 
occasioanlly last year so it&#x27;s not a suprise. (Everybody out there 
better know the R vs. r notation!!!)

Parity Problem #2: Swap two edge &quot;pairs&quot; (I mean the triple minus 
the middle) (same problem as having to swap two corners) this one I 
like, it&#x27;s easy and fast. (if on UF and UB) Just do r2U2r2U2-d2r2d2. 
(I figured this one out myself, but is probably the same as the one 
on Hardwick&#x27;s site, a bit of a composite manuver where two r2&#x27;s 
cancel out.)

got some funky results (and I know their secondary effects - those 
on center pieces)... 2 central edge pieces must be swapped on my 
cube (central edge pieces are single stickered center pieces in my 
terminology (I use &quot;central edge&quot; and &quot;central corner&quot; and might 
use &quot;center edge&quot; or &quot;middle edge&quot; for true edge pieces)). Wonder if 
any of you know and alg for this one...

The given algorithms are most suited for memorization purposes, not 
speed of execution... but judging by the parity algs shown to me by 
others last weekend, mine might be pretty darn fast too (it&#x27;s all 
relative).

          <div class="email-content">Hi, <br>
<br>
I need a lot of help with the cross and F2L. I am tryin to convert <br>
my system into Fridrich&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
I have a really bad intuition and it would take me more than 45 <br>
seconds to find an optimal algorithm (or close to optimal) to the <br>
cross. I dont want to memorize any algorithms for the cross (who <br>
would), so what do i do?<br>
<br>
And for the F2L. I believe if i lern the F2L (pairing) my time would <br>
greatly decrease. Should i memorise the F2L algorithms on <br>
www.speedcubing.com? The algorithms there are pretty good for me, <br>
has lots of F, U, anr R (LOL). <br>
<br>
ANd for memorizing. I want to be an excellent speed cuber and my <br>
rubiks goal is to get sub-25. As i said, im transfering into <br>
Fridrichs method. I have a really bad memory but i want to learn all <br>
OLL and PLL. What do you guys think a good rate of memorizing would <br>
be? (1 or 2 a day?)<br>
<br>
And last, i need a better speedcube. I dont want to spend 70 USD on <br>
a speedcube from Ton D. (but i bet there really really good). So, is <br>
it worth it to buy a 1980 rubiks cube? will it help my times? And <br>
also, do any of you guys have some 1980&#x27;s cubes to sell for cheap? <br>
Im only 13 and i dont make alot of money. AND is Arxon cubes better <br>
than Ideal cubes?<br>

ok, im done<br>

          <div class="email-content">don&#x27;t start out by trying to find an optimal algorithm for the whole 
cross.  start out by finding the optimal alg for 2 pieces of the 
cross in the pre-examination.  then move on to 3 pieces.  and once 
you&#x27;ve mastered that, then do all 4 pieces.

my opinion is that memorizing loads of 6-8 move algs for f2l is not 
the way to start off if you&#x27;re ultimitely going for speed.  take the 
time to figure the algs out on your own-- it will be very slow at 
first, sometimes taking minutes to solve one corner edge pair.  but 
you will eventually learn to see all the different cases.  once 
you&#x27;ve categorized all the cases in your head (this may take months 
depending on how much you cube), then you can look at the f2l algs 
to see which ones you can improve on.  there are a few f2l algs 
where the shortest solution is not intuitive.

forget memorizing the actual moves for oll/pll.  what you are after 
is memorizing the starting configuration for both hands (which 
facelets to put which fingers on) and then a series of finger/hand 
flexions.  you will have no idea what faces you are actually turning-
- it will just be a sequence of finger and wrist flexions.  at first 
it will take you about an hour to totally dissect an alg into its 
sections and find the optimum cube rotations, grip positions, and 
finger tricks that work for *you*.  forget what other people do-- 
learn only what you do best.  although if you don&#x27;t already know the 
various finger-tricks that are possible, then it might make sense to 
check out other cubist&#x27;s sites to see what&#x27;s possible.  also, 
learning one alg a day is a good rate.  then spend one day each week 
only reviewing algs you know-- let them &#x27;solidify&#x27; in your head-- 
give your learning brain a break.  each oll/pll alg must be done 
hundreds of times before it is sub-25 quality.  

you definitely don&#x27;t need a $70 speed cube from ton-- it won&#x27;t help 
your times right now.  what you need is a cube that doesn&#x27;t let you 
cut corners-- so that you learn the algs without the benefit of 
being able to make slight errors of incomplete/overcomplete turns.  
so just buy a new 2003 cube (or 1980&#x27;s is fine), turn it for an 
hour, then lube it with silicone spray and your good to go.  when 
you&#x27;re sub-30, then worry about $70 for ton&#x27;s cube.

<br>
Well, I did probably only 5 solves to warm up before my qualifying <br>

&gt; What would you say your average number of solves was, per day, two <br>

<br>
As I work full time, I don&#x27;t really have time that I dedicate to <br>
cubing.  My approach to it (as has been pretty consistent for the <br>
past couple years) is to always have a cube with me, frequently <br>
fiddling (when not typing, etc.), and I probably don&#x27;t solve the cube <br>
(or any puzzle, aside from the oinkleburger.com applet) more than 15-<br>
20 times in a typical day.  I may just not realize it, though, so I <br>
suppose this could be as high as 30-35, but I don&#x27;t anticipate it&#x27;s <br>
any higher than that.<br>
<br>
&gt; Did you &quot;taper&quot;, as one would in many sports...or did you just<br>
&gt; solve and solve and solve...trying to learn new algorithms and new <br>
&gt; techniques?<br>
<br>
I would&#x27;ve liked to spend more time practicing, leading up to the WC, <br>

Hi Robert,

   The Arxon cubes are Ideal cubes:
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2006%20White%20-%20Yellow,%20White%20next%20to%20Red%20next%20to%20Green%20Arxon%201980.htm

   I would recommend getting a 1980 vintage era Ideal cube because
thay are adjustable and usually cheaper on ebay than a new studio cube
which is the only authentic one made today with the screws.

   Sealed ones are getting a little expensive, but there are used ones
that are OK. The easies to tell might be the British version they&#x27;re
the ones in the cardboard cylinder.
 
   This one is from the batch made in in the 1979 style (see the
protruding lines under the edge cubie stickers?) which I personally
don&#x27;t recommend: 
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2016%20Ideal%20UK%20(type%20like%20US)%201980.htm

    I prefer this one (see those lines aren&#x27;t there?):
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2017%20Ideal%20UK.htm

   If you get one in a clear cylinder like this:
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2006%20White%20-%20Yellow,%20White%20next%20to%20Red%20next%20to%20Green%20Arxon%201980.htm
make sure it&#x27;s Ideal because some pirate firms copied the case too.

Hope this helps:
David J

&gt; I have found four images that I did not post where you can be seen. <br>
&gt; Plus, I updated my page and indicated you on my Page 2 of images <br>

          <div class="email-content">for the F2L, i use pejave&#x27;s algs,  they are very good, mostly 2 gen for fastness.  to memorize these, i just take a pair of 10 and cram it into my brain.  maybe you dont want to do that, you could take 2 at a time and memorize.  just try to think in groupings of finger tricks.  for OLL and PLL, those are a lot of algs.  im still working on them.  try to do dan knight&#x27;s 4 look method for beginners.  these are really easy, only about 7.  then learn his 3 look method which is the same OLL but you permute all.  in 2 look, you have to memorize over 50 OLL algs.  this will be pretty hard with someone with bad memory.  it will take about a year or a year and a half to memorize them. for a speedcube, use the rubiks.com ones, they last the longest.  get a few of those.  when you get really good, you should buy a studio speedcube--about 20-24 bucks.  good luck!

Hi, 

I need a lot of help with the cross and F2L. I am tryin to convert 
my system into Fridrich&#x27;s.

I have a really bad intuition and it would take me more than 45 
seconds to find an optimal algorithm (or close to optimal) to the 
cross. I dont want to memorize any algorithms for the cross (who 
would), so what do i do?

And for the F2L. I believe if i lern the F2L (pairing) my time would 
greatly decrease. Should i memorise the F2L algorithms on 
www.speedcubing.com? The algorithms there are pretty good for me, 
has lots of F, U, anr R (LOL). 

ANd for memorizing. I want to be an excellent speed cuber and my 
rubiks goal is to get sub-25. As i said, im transfering into 
Fridrichs method. I have a really bad memory but i want to learn all 
OLL and PLL. What do you guys think a good rate of memorizing would 
be? (1 or 2 a day?)

And last, i need a better speedcube. I dont want to spend 70 USD on 
a speedcube from Ton D. (but i bet there really really good). So, is 
it worth it to buy a 1980 rubiks cube? will it help my times? And 
also, do any of you guys have some 1980&#x27;s cubes to sell for cheap? 
Im only 13 and i dont make alot of money. AND is Arxon cubes better 
than Ideal cubes?

ok, im done

existed in 1982 vs. the recent competition.  I realize that some of <br>
the same people competed, and some of the people, including 3 of the <br>
8 finalists, were cubing during the initial cube craze.  Of course we <br>
can&#x27;t really compare official times since the intial competition had <br>
stiff cubes and a different format.  I&#x27;d like to hear from people, <br>
especially people who were around for the first WC, if they think the <br>
group of cubers at this years competition were faster than in 1982 or <br>
not.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I remember two years ago at Cedar Point I got a bit of free food 
that I ended up sharing with my friends just for solving the cube. 
It really needs to be someone elses cube. (Like you show them your 
speed wiht yourone then they have you do their keychain cube or 
something.)

Back then I was able to solve it around 1:00 now I&#x27;m jsut strange if 
I do it in public, once you solve it say faster then 35s people 
start not even believing it, like it&#x27;s some trick your doing... 
(Btw, if your slower then 1:40 people tend not to wait around till 
your done (fond memories of 10th grade Calc class).)

Solving it while shoping, perhaps in the mall, I jsut get some 
stares. Most people arn&#x27;t brave enough to come up to me and ask for 
a demonstration, but may be this nifty T-shirt (wearing the wc shirt 
right now) will change things, lol.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for that help, there is one more question though.  On the last <br>
two edge &quot;triplets&quot; (unpaired yet in the FL and FR)I sometimes get a <br>

to the other unsolved triplet.<br>
<br>
How can I solve this, it usually take me more than 10 minutes of just <br>
playing with it.<br>
<br>
Say my last two unsolved triplets are in the FL and FR.  In each of <br>
the 2 triplets I have correctly placed the 2 outer edges.  The middle <br>
edges however need to be switched between the 2 triplets.  This is <br>
the situation that I am trying to describe.<br>

          <div class="email-content">(Sidenote: I deleted your unintentional double [identical] post.)

This is analogous to my given parity problem #2... the algorithm I 
supplied is wrong, but appearnetly none of us know of a better one. 
Mine does what is needed (more for when it&#x27;s closed to solved, as 
opposed to close to a segmented 3x3), but swaps two &quot;central&quot;-edges 
on opposite sides. I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to work, but thanks to 
Grant for pointing that out :). Um..., at least that is a very quick 
algorithm to perform... and I&#x27;m sure you can figure out one of the 
many ways of swapping two central-edge pieces (one-stickered-guys). 
I just made one up on the spot... love doing these that! But 
resouted to using my normal 3 cycle of center pieces on adjacent 
faces earlier, had to do that like 3 times to completely &quot;carry it 
over.&quot; I don&#x27;t recommend 3-cycles for speedcubing though.

What I just did to swap two central-edge pieces was to get them 
mirrored directly accross the origin (on F and B), then do a bit of 
a &quot;mini-H permutation or mini-+ permutation&quot;: (Dd)^2 M&#x27;U2M-d2M&#x27;U2MD2.

I know...., I know (head-down in shame), this is fairly yukky...

to show the resourcefulness/mathyness of us cubists :))

          <div class="email-content">&gt; What would you say your average number of solves was, per day, two <br>
&gt; months from the WC?  In the last month, leading up to the <br>
&gt; championship?  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Did you &quot;taper&quot;, as one would in many sports...or did you just <br>
solve <br>
&gt; and solve and solve...trying to learn new algorithms and new <br>
&gt; techniques?<br>
<br>
<br>
I think generous time off is often beneficial.  I took off 17 months <br>
between September 2001 and May 2003.  Then on 5/9/2003, after only 2 <br>
days of cubing 3 hours a day, I got my best average ever!  I&#x27;ve heard <br>
that time off allows your brain to discard extraneous information, <br>
sort of like defragmenting a hard drive.<br>
<br>
Between May and August I only trained 1-2 days a week, 100 solves per <br>
day.  I have carpal tunnel from typing, so if I cube too much I lose <br>
feeling in my hands and other really bad stuff happens.  Instead I <br>
train with a focus, like using a metronome, performing in public, or <br>
simulating competition settings.<br>
<br>
I tried to solve the cube as little as possible in the week before <br>
the championship.  I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get faster at that point, so I <br>
iced my arms and focused instead on the mental aspect.  On the first <br>
day of the competition, I only did 2 averages to warm up, one of <br>
which tied my best average ever (16.8).<br>
<br>
Of course now I&#x27;m totally inspired by everyone at the championship, <br>
so I haven&#x27;t been able to put down my cube for more than an hour.  I <br>
am already working on a new method for the next championship, but I <br>
really need to put my arms on ice for a month.  I am like Linus with <br>
his blanket -- I need someone to take my cubes away from me!  ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Since these posts have come up on here I&#x27;ve been trying to look for 
an efficient way to do this, also to do it if one edge is flipped or 
if one edge is flipped and the other has the parity issue, things 
like that.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have special algs to do any of 
that.  I always just solve that case by using my standard slice move 
followed by flipping an edge, followed by undoing the original slice 
move.

If the edges are as you described and in FR and FL do d R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F 
d2 L&#x27; F U&#x27; L F&#x27; d which is 13 moves.  This move only works if you 
haven&#x27;t started solving like a 3x3x3 yet.

Another way to do this move is put the two edge pieces on opposite 
diagonals, so put one piece in FL and one in BR then do d2 L&#x27; F U&#x27; L 
F&#x27; R&#x27; B U&#x27; R B&#x27; d2 which is 12 moves and also only works if you 
haven&#x27;t started solving as a 3x3x3 yet.

If you have the entire cube solved and you just need to switch the 
outer edge groups (same as above), without messing everything up, do 
d2 F2 d2 F2 f2 d2 f2 R2 s2 R&#x27; f2 R s2 R&#x27; f2 R&#x27; where s means just 
the innermost s slice.

This move is a lot faster if you have the edges you need to swap in 
UF and UB and do the move like this,
r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2 F2 e2 F u2 F&#x27; e2 F u2 F

The second move here is the same as the one above it just 
reflected.  I&#x27;m sure there are faster (i.e. fewer moves) ways to 
solve all these cases but these are the best algs that I know.

Hope this helps some,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone, <br>
<br>
My WC2003 Experience pages are now online, go to www.cubestation.co.uk and follow the link!<br>
<br>
I have a request, does anyone have a video still or a picture of me solving on stage on the second day, that I could use to finish off the page? I would be very thankful, it would make the page complete.<br>
<br>
FInally, the FMC is now online, so if the WC has inspired you to take up more cube disciplines than just the 3x3x3 speedsolve (I know it has for me!) then why not have a go! Simply follow the starred link on my site.<br>
<br>
Good Luck everyone, and thanks for a great time in Toronto! - DanH :) www.cubestation.co.uk<br>

<br>
Fear not, there are other slow(er) learners out there...  I played <br>
with the cube for probably 1 1/2 - 2 years and only got my time down <br>
to 1:30 on average, never breaking about 1:15 or 1:20.  I got to the <br>
point that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get any faster, and lost interest for a <br>
while.  I then picked it up again after a year or so off, and it took <br>
me probably another 6 months to a year (maybe even more) to get it <br>
down under 1 minute.  For the last year, at least, I&#x27;ve been hovering <br>
with an average in the 28-33 second range.  I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll <br>
eventually get the chance to finish learning the other OLL cases <br>
(about 20 of 57 left), and that should drop my average consistently <br>
under 30.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well I started speedcubing around Summer of 1998 and was immediatly 
doing a little over 2 minutes using a 4 look LL and intuitive F2L 
(combination of basic, basic layers and Petrus, would of been better 
if I knew about slant c/e pairing :)). Then I remember a long 
streach of 1:30 around 2.5 years ago... early 2001. Within 15 months 
I was averaging under 30s... so probably touched at bit under 1:10 
in April of that year and touched under 1:00 minute around August. 
Probably averaged under 1 minute just as summer started, and after a 
ton of practice over that summer averaged 45s. Even remembering 
showing off a 46s solve to my molecular bio class in July...

So getting around 1:00 isn&#x27;t that hard, but I did it the gruling way 
of figuring out my own system and perfecting many of my own 
algorithms until coasting too long at 90s. With internet sites 
showing advanced systems already and perhaps a friend to guide you, 
it&#x27;s only a matter of time. I got my friend to about 70s after 
teaching him for 5 weeks with absolutely no prior experience and not 
of a technical background.

I practice much more now... solving over 250 cubes per day, but 
taking a bit of a break after wc. A bit obsessed with my 4x4 and 
breaking 50s left-handed on the 3x3.... still can&#x27;t find a 
comfortable pool! Might get into the simpler stuff like 2x2 and 
pyraminx though.

          <div class="email-content">It took me sooooo long to get to a minute. I started with a terrible 
solution, one from a book, where I couldn&#x27;t get anywhere below about 
1.5 to 2 minutes.
Also, I think people that start out with the Fridrich solution learn 
much quicker. I don&#x27;t know why, but it could be because almost 
everyone uses that method.

&gt; Also, I think people that start out with the Fridrich solution learn <br>
&gt; much quicker. I don&#x27;t know why,<br>
<br>
I think one reason is that the Fridrich system includes a complete table<br>
of first two layer positions and their solutions. After you memorise<br>
this table, you will be able to react to any position very quickly.<br>
<br>
For the Petrus method, this sort of approach is impractical because<br>
there are too many different positions to memorise. Without such a<br>
table, learning is a very slow and difficult process.<br>
<br>
So why would anyone want to learn the slow and difficult way? Well, if<br>
you want to understand more about the cube, that&#x27;s the best way!<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Wen i read posts, i get the feeling that most cubers could get there<br>
&gt; &gt; times to only a minute in like a day. ITS TAKEM ME LONG TO GET TO<br>
&gt; &gt; ONE MINUTE. (with my method that is)<br>
<br>
Is it a layers method?<br>
<br>
I think beginners generally lose most time in the last layer and not the<br>
first two layers. But for experts, it&#x27;s the other way around.<br>
<br>
The first two layers can be done in very straightforward steps, without<br>
thinking:<br>
<br>
- first layer cross, one piece at a time.<br>
- first layer corners, one piece at a time.<br>
- second layer edges, one piece at a time.<br>
<br>
When you get to the last layer, you always need to consider 3 or 4<br>
pieces at a time, so more thought is required. If you post the details<br>
of your method, I can give you further advice.<br>

RP: In my personal opinion, you need to work on your
cross before anything.  A sharp and quick cross seems
to set the pace for my solves.

RP: F2L algs are good, but also good is to discover
some of the situations on your own.  Also something to
consider, doing your cross on the left.  This makes it
to where all your f2l algs can be rights and ups. 
Check www.rubiks.dk, jess has one of the finest sites
i&#x27;ve seen, for f2l, OLL, and PLL.

RP: First off, you don&#x27;t need to learn OLL to be a
sub25 cuber.  With a standard 3-look LL you
should/would be able to pull it off.
13-14 sec F2L
10-11 sec LL
As far as algorithms go, i think the number depends on
what you&#x27;re learning.  If you are learning an F2L alg
that has a mirror, it is good to get that in your head
on the same day.  If you are bad with memory, maybe
only one LL alg a day would be fine.  Just remember to
practice all new algs often so as not to forget them
easily.

          <div class="email-content">When coming back from Toronto, I was cubing at an airport cafe while 
waiting for my connecting flight. I wasn&#x27;t speedsolving, I was just 
solving. A waitress walked past and asked me if I thought that I&#x27;d 
ever be able to solve it. A question like this obviously calls for a 
demo -- so I solved for her. She was very impressed and asked if I 
could do another demo for her friend. So I did. Then someone at the 
bar asked me about it, so I did another solve. :) Maybe I should&#x27;ve 
asked for a free coffee! :)

Same thing happened on several of my flights back to Canberra (took 4 
flights getting from Washington DC to Canberra!). The scenario each 
time was along the lines... (1) I would play with my cube (2) 
Observer (flight attendant or another passenger) doesn&#x27;t realise that 
I am actually solving-scrambling-solving-scrambling over and over 
again, and so makes a comment (eg. have you ever solved that thing?) 
(3) I do a demo and then tell them about RWC2003 (4) Observer thinks 
I&#x27;m a freak.

I&#x27;m also very interested in learning blindfold so I began with a 2x2, 
but i cant find a good solution that&#x27;s not too complicated.  When I 
get more time though, I&#x27;d really like to learn that  (especially if 
there is a straight forward way of doing it)

On my way to Toronto I had two cubes on me when going through 
security (my shorts had big pockets).  Since the thing beeped when i 
walked through, the guy had to sort of search me.  Made me take out 
everything in my pockets...pulled out the cube in my right pocket, 
he didnt say much, took out some more stuff.  Then took out the 
other cube, and he sort of laughed because i had two of them.  He 
didnt say anything about it though...

Going through security on my way home from the Toronto airport, i 
was holding my cube.  When we made it to the guy in the desk who you 
have to sort of talk to a little bit, he asked me about the cube.. i 
told him i was just coming home from the WC.  He made me solve it a 
couple times :D
hehe

cant wait till 2005

instead of stiff hands, it should be Olly Hayden to pay tribute to 
the method. I use this BLD method too, not much success, I am

worked on... I can do about half of waht is needed, half the time, 
lol.

My long-term memory is pretty good though - mapped out, memorized, 
and actively using algs for over 10% of all LL cases. (1212 of them 
but don&#x27;t like that counting... >6000 with inverses, mirror, and 
both) And increasing :)... will be saying good bye to my 9s LL 
average, ok probably not... recognition will be rough. Curious... 
anyone else currently pursuing such a tedious goal?

I just saw a picture of DanG juggling 3 cubes (must of been outside) 
on Day 1 alongside Macky. I just have to say.... very, very cool.

It is on the links page of this group, though you have to replace 
ssie with ws, or go to Jessica&#x27;s page and follow the links there.

He&#x27;s an alum from that college and probably a busy guy, the school

Very unreliable site. No offense to DanK of course, just towards the

          <div class="email-content">(Sidenote: Sorry for all these straight posts, not DP since of 
different threads, but just taking a break from all my move-in craze 
today.)

Nothing quite like that, but then again I drove and it was only to a 
neighbooring frendly country. But let me list some weird things that 
happened to me anyways:

1) Entering, customs: &quot;Why are you coming to Canada?&quot;
Me: &quot;Here for the International Rubik&#x27;s ...(cut off)&quot;
Dad: &quot;Uh...., to see Niagra Falls!&quot;

2) Waited half-hour for Wesley at the airport with no luck, 
appearently his luggage got lost or something and came out 5 min 
after I gave up. Got to that hotel at the same time (reminds me: 
forgot to fill-out the service servey to highlight their extreamly 
crapy bar service). So I take out my cube so that we can better 
introduce ourselves... as strange as that sounds but probably 
typical here :). The guy behind the counter askes: &quot;So there&#x27;s a 
cube convention here, eh?&quot; Me (proudly): &quot;NO, International Rubik&#x27;s 
Cube Championships.&quot; So I had to do the cube for them and got a 
23.xx cold and after 7 hrs of driving. &quot;And can you [David] do it 
too?&quot; Me: &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s much faster then me...&quot; (lol) David didn&#x27;t even 
have to perform!

3) Clerk at OSC Giftshop: &quot;Interested in buying a Rubik&#x27;s Cube?&quot; 
Me: &quot;I already have a dozen of these...&quot; She turns away. Me: &quot;I 
didn&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t interested!&quot;

4) Leaving, Customs: &quot;I was here for the International Rubik&#x27;s Cube 
Competition.&quot; After some good/sensible conversation about times and 
winners, no performance needed. Customs: &quot;Ok you story sounds too 
outlandish to be a lie.&quot; Then he makes me dump all my beef 
products... appearently a madcow problem in Canada... and probably 
why we were able to get free BigMacs at MacD.

So nobody thought I had cocaine stuffed up my cube... (which I 
DIDN&#x27;T!). There was actaully a cube ban in many US penitentiaries 
back in the 80s due to this ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, 345 cube is the minimum I needed for the three designs. I 
brought about 360 cubes. I had the remaining 15 cubes for answering 
questions about how those designs are set up, parity pairs,and a few 
things I devoped as part of solving the deusign probeum. I  came to 
Toronto looking for someone who can do this, and found no one. So I

<br>
I&#x27;ll describe the beginner and intermediate methods that I once used.<br>
They are simplications of the Fridrich last layer system. You need to<br>
first understand how that system works:<br>
<br>
	http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html#last<br>
<br>
This general strategy, orienting first, then permuting, is good because<br>
it is very easy to recognise the positions quickly. But instead of<br>
orienting all the pieces at once, you just orient the edges first, and<br>
the corners second.<br>
<br>
BEGINNER METHOD<br>
<br>
First, orient the 4 edges (ie. make a cross). There are only 4 patterns,<br>
and one algorithm to solve them all! To view this, you need to use a<br>
fixed width font:<br>
<br>
---  ---  -x-  -x-<br>
-x-  xxx  xx-  xxx<br>
---  ---  ---  -x-<br>
<br>
For each pattern, apply the algorithm &quot;R&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;U F R&quot; and it will take you<br>
to the next pattern. Eventually you will end up with a cross.<br>
<br>
Improvement: notice that if you apply the algorithm when you already<br>
have the cross, you will end up with a line. That means that you can<br>
jump immediately from the 2nd pattern to the 4th pattern by applying the<br>
algorithm backwards! So, this step should take an average of 6 moves.<br>
<br>
Next, orient the corners. There are only 6 patterns apart from solved.<br>
Look through this complete list, and find all the patterns (and<br>
algorithms) that have a cross already formed:<br>
<br>
	http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html<br>
<br>
For the case when 3 corners need to be twisted, I recommend the Sune TM<br>
algorithm from Petrus. See the applet at the top/right of his page:<br>
<br>
	http://lar5.com/cube/fas6.html<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s useful to learn to twist them forwards and backwards:<br>
<br>
- R U R&#x27;U R U2 R&#x27;<br>
- R&#x27;U&#x27;R U&#x27;R&#x27;U2 R<br>
<br>
To see that done fast, have a look at the quicktime movies at the bottom<br>
of this page:<br>
<br>
	http://lar5.com/cube/speed.html<br>
<br>
I recommend this algorithm because one of the other orientation cases<br>
can be solved by just applying this algorithm twice. To know which case<br>
I&#x27;m talking about, apply this to a solved cube: RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Now, apply the sune (RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;) twice:<br>
<br>
RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27; + RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;<br>
<br>
Notice that the moves in the middle cancel out? So you can actually do:<br>
<br>
RUR&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27;URU2R&#x27;<br>
<br>
which is an &quot;optimal&quot; solution.<br>
<br>
Next, permute the corners (yes, before the edges). Most of the time<br>
there will be a 3 cycle of corners. In this case, look at the 4 sides of<br>
the last layer. On one of the sides, the two last layer corners will be<br>
matching in colour. Hold those two corners on the back side and do:<br>
<br>
R&#x27;FR&#x27; B2 RF&#x27;R&#x27; B2 R2<br>
<br>
Now the corners should be solved. If you don&#x27;t find any two corners that<br>
match, apply the above algorithm and that should result in a position<br>
where two corners match. Don&#x27;t worry, this case rarely happens. If you<br>
want, you can learn a special algorithm for that case by picking the<br>
most attractive one from:<br>
<br>
	http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html<br>
<br>
The &quot;Y&quot; pattern on that page has the desired corner effect.<br>
<br>
Next, permute the edges. Again, most of the time, there will be a 3<br>
cycle of edges. You need to learn to cycle the edges forwards and<br>
backwards:<br>
<br>
- R2U FB&#x27;R2F&#x27;BU R2<br>
- R2U&#x27;FB&#x27;R2F&#x27;BU&#x27;R2<br>
<br>
Sometimes, all 4 edges need to be swapped in opposite pairs. That&#x27;s an<br>
easy case, so why not learn it:<br>
<br>
RLU2R&#x27;L&#x27; [U] R&#x27;L&#x27;U2RL<br>
<br>
The [U] means rotate the whole cube from the up side, 90 degrees.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s also a rare case where all 4 edges need to be swapped in<br>
adjacent pairs. The algorithm&#x27;s difficult so it&#x27;s not worth learning.<br>
<br>
INTERMEDIATE METHOD<br>
<br>
First, orient everything like the beginner method. Then permute<br>
everything like the full blown Fridrich method.<br>
<br>
How can you learn all the permutations? See my previous email:<br>
<br>
	http://groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/4736<br>
<br>
There, I list which algorithms to learn first, and which algorithms to<br>
learn last.<br>
<br>
ADVANCED METHOD<br>
<br>
You already know enough! It is not necessary to learn 40 orientation<br>
algorithms. 6 is enough. Gilles Roux proved that it is possible to<br>
achieve sub-20 times with just these 6 orientation algorithms and 13<br>
permutation algorithms. He used the petrus method for the first two<br>
layers which gives you a cross automatically when you get to the last<br>
layer. Using that strategy, those extra orientation algorithms are not<br>
needed.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
I got interested in blindfolded cubing maybe 2-3 weeks ago.  I was confused<br>
by all of the different methods I had read, but finally worked out a system<br>
that works for me.  As it stands I have solved several 2x2&#x27;s blindfolded.<br>
No 3x3x3&#x27;s yet.  But last night, after taking a week of, I tried again.<br>
After about 20 minutes of memorization, and about 10 minutes of solving, I<br>
opened my eyes and I was 2 moves away!  I was so excited and so depressed at<br>
the same time :)<br>
<br>
 At any rate, my system is based largely on the PDF file from Richard Carr,<br>
but I&#x27;d be happy to post it if anyone would like.<br>

I first orient and then premute, it&#x27;s easyer to remember them like 
that.
But don&#x27;t forget when you permute to bring the corners and the edges 
to the last layer with moves that doesn&#x27;t change the orientation of 
the pieces, I.E. for the corners do moves within the U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2 
group and for the edges do moves within the U,D,F,B,R2,L2 group. 
then you do a three-cycle in the last layer and bring the pieces 
back by reverse the moves you needed to bring them up.
you can give me an example of a scrambled cub and I will show you 
how the steps goes.

<br>
The WC was great! Thank God we also got to see a little bit of Canada <br>
too. We just arrived. Thanks everyone for a great time, and thanks <br>
DanG for making this possible..<br>
<br>
How are we doing? I am bound to put my cube away a while to rest my <br>
arms (ouch) and to concentrate on other things in life...<br>
<br>
I am satisfied with my results, I had 6 runs and five of them were <br>
below my average. That must have been the lube doing that. I wasn&#x27;t <br>
nervous at all.<br>
<br>
Last week Yasmara has set her personal record almost every day. That <br>
makes me envious, man! Times have developed as follows<br>
<br>
8 days prior: first picked up a cube<br>
7 days prior: able to do two layers<br>
6 days prior: able to do LL orientation<br>
5 days prior: able to do LL permutation<br>
<br>
8 minutes (4 days prior)<br>
6 minutes (3 days prior)<br>
4 minutesa (2 days prior)<br>
3.56 (at WC), <br>
3.06, day later<br>
2.42, day later<br>
1.52, two days later<br>
<br>
So in two weeks anyone can do this. Maybe I will put up a beginners <br>
page to show you how you can do this. I have tried the method a <br>
couple of times for speed, and have gotten 30 seconds. When I choose <br>
not to use finger triggers and shortcuts, I can get to 1:30.<br>
<br>
In short, this is the method:<br>
1. first layer - create cross, no algs<br>
2. first layer - corners, no algs<br>
3. second layer - (RD)2 R (D&#x27;R&#x27;)2<br>
4. third layer - edges orientation: RBUB&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;<br>
5. third layer - corners permutation: RUL&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;L<br>
6. third layer - corners orientation: RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;<br>
7. third layer - edge permutation : same as 6, using it multiple <br>
times, combined with its mirror (try it!)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll keep you all posted.<br>

As you might know many speedcubers uses a Rubiks Studio cube. I have <br>
some great news. Rubik&#x27;s Studio is willing to sell me the new <br>
improved cubes for a low price so that I can offer them via my site <br>
wwww.speedcubing.com/ton again. This cube will be produce without the <br>
center caps be glued on! So it will not be very hard to get to the <br>
screws and prepare and tune the cubes!<br>
<br>
The price will be about $10 per cube, shipment is $7,50 world wide, <br>
for 2 to or more it will be $15-$20. As soon as I can give some <br>
details I will offer them to you all.<br>
<br>
I would like to express that the Rubiks.com cube is a fine cube if <br>
you do not need any special tuning. For the Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes it <br>
is recommended that you always adjust the screws to your liking.<br>

    An addendum to my last post on the subject.  My brain had ample time to<br>
cool since last night and I made another attempt.  This one was successful!<br>
My first blindfolded 3x3x3 cube!  Took about 20 minutes memorize and 10<br>

I&#x27;m very very excited :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I got a few free meals back in the 80s, but my best story happened a <br>
few months back. My future wife met some teenage girls trying to <br>
solve a cube while waiting for me in a coffee shop in Gilroy. I <br>
arrived and did some speed solves.  To break the stunned silence I <br>
mentioned that it was an unusually good cube. I don&#x27;t know if the <br>
owner thought that meant I wanted it, that she wished it to have a <br>
good home, or if she just gave up after seeing me, but to my <br>
astonishment she insisted on giving me the cube after that!!<br>
<br>
And I think that was the cube I used for 3x3x3 speed in Toronto! For <br>
the one handed I used an other gift cube that David Wesley gave me <br>
after having felt the relative unsmoothness of my competition cube. <br>
It was too smooth for my brutal two handed style, but perfect for one <br>
hand. And I got 4 seconds from beating him with it! Thanx David!<br>
<br>
As so often, I sense there is probably some moral to these stories, <br>
but I can&#x27;t quite make out what it is.<br>
<br>
This was just one of several recent cube sightings. I think I&#x27;ve seen <br>
more cubes this year among civilians than during the entire 90s.<br>

<br>
One is 14.87 seconds, which is fun due to the speed of course, but <br>
the 18.51 one is far more typical and is filmed from a better angle. <br>
It also has the URL for my perhaps marginally obsessive frame by <br>

If I do any more videos, I&#x27;ll put in one (or more) mirrors so you can <br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree that I think it is certainly &quot;easier&quot; to get fast now than it 
was in the early 80&#x27;s, thanks to the internet and computer generated 
algorithms.  But keep in mind that the cube was much, much more 
popular then and there were a lot more competitions going on.  So 
while there was less &quot;information&quot;, there were a lot more motivated 
people working on the cube.  A number of this year&#x27;s finalists were 
people that were for the most part doing the same methods they were 
using 20 years ago.  From comments I&#x27;ve heard attributed to Jessica 
and David Allen, they were both &quot;faster&quot; 20 years ago, but they&#x27;ve 
made slight improvements to their methods over time so net times are 
still fairly close.  So if Jessica is about as fast as she was in &#x27;82 
(or maybe a little slower) and she was middle of the pack in &#x27;82 and 
she was 2nd this year, what happened?  Was it luck, a different 
format, using your own cube, or slower competition?

          <div class="email-content">Don&#x27;t take the placements of the 82 competition too seriously. Any of 
10-12 people could have won, and it was mostly based on luck who 
happened to get a good result during their three attempts. I expect 
that I would have ended up worse than my 4th place in a serious 
competition. But we&#x27;ll never know that.

I was used to bad cubes and only lost 2-4 seconds due to them, but 
people with different techniques must have lost a lot more, as would 
people used to a different color scheme.

An other major difference was that only the national champions of 19 
countries were invited, leaving at least hundreds of cubers who would 
have had a chance of winning out of the running.

Yeah, kids today definitely have it easier, and no doubt use better 
systems that they didn&#x27;t have to spend nearly as much time inventing. 
I guess that means that the most talented people would achieve better 
times today. Then again most of those most talented kids probably has 
never seen or heard of a cube today.

I have no doubt that if this takes off as a serious professional 
sport, all our current records will be blown away, Tiger Woods style, 
by some amazingly skilled and well trained people.

To answer the original question, I&#x27;ll have to say I think the 2003 
level was higher than 1982, mostly due to the one competitor per 
country rule. Just try to imagine how empty and dull it would have 
made this year. Or compare the 19th placed result in 2003 (22.60) 
with the one in 1982 (54.69).

BTW, you should have seen the cubes for the Swedish 1981 competition. 
I won that one in over 40 seconds!!

          <div class="email-content">i&#x27;m using a solution close to dan k&#x27;s intermediate solution.<br>
<br>
on the last level i have quite a high probability that one of my 4 steps <br>
will be already solved<br>
orient edges 1/8 is solved<br>
position corner 1/6 is solved<br>
orient corner 1/27<br>
permute edges 1/12<br>
<br>
and the it&#x27;s the F2L where i quite often end up with one of the corner / <br>
edge pairs are already solved .. not sure of the probability there but at <br>
least 1/30 i think.<br>
<br>
So in fact the probability of skipping at least one step is like one in <br>
four.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s getting quite hard to do a 12 solve average then without bumping into <br>
a few lucky cases.<br>
<br>
I understand that when you use only 2 steps in the last layer, skipping one <br>
of them will feel like a very lucky case, and that those cases should not <br>
be counted, but not in my case.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.<br>

  I agree that I think it is certainly &quot;easier&quot; to get fast now than it 
  was in the early 80&#x27;s, thanks to the internet and computer generated 
  algorithms.  But keep in mind that the cube was much, much more 
  popular then and there were a lot more competitions going on.  So 
  while there was less &quot;information&quot;, there were a lot more motivated 
  people working on the cube.  A number of this year&#x27;s finalists were 
  people that were for the most part doing the same methods they were 
  using 20 years ago.  From comments I&#x27;ve heard attributed to Jessica 
  and David Allen, they were both &quot;faster&quot; 20 years ago, but they&#x27;ve 
  made slight improvements to their methods over time so net times are 
  still fairly close.  So if Jessica is about as fast as she was in &#x27;82 
  (or maybe a little slower) and she was middle of the pack in &#x27;82 and 
  she was 2nd this year, what happened?  Was it luck, a different 
  format, using your own cube, or slower competition?

Ok, I&#x27;ve been cubing for a while, and I know how difficult it can really get (4x4x4, 5x5x5 etc.).  When I see records of Ron _averaging_ 15.4, and Wesly with a time of 1 minute 9 some seconds with 4x4x4, It is _Just _Insane_.  I cannot even imagine myself averaging 7-8 minutes with the 5x5x5, and here Wesly is averaging less than 3.  Another example, Lars V. _dominated_ the square-1 competition, and only a few _dominate_ the megaminx area (Grant for one..).  I am just wondering, how do you guyz get so fast?  I can improve my 3x3x3 average by a couple seconds, but it would take me __months___ and many __hours___ of just practicing.  Just...how???  it is really insane...(i.e. David allen&#x27;s and Gene&#x27;s finger tricks for another).  and who can forget Chris&#x27; &#x27;one hand&#x27; solves?  so much supremecy...  and those blindfold guyz (i think Orser) tried 10 3x3x3 at one time blindfolded!! daaaaaaaang....<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think that cubers are much faster today than in June of 1982. It <br>
is because of all the sharing done via the Internet and the computer-<br>
generated algorithms. Back in 1982 there was no communication among <br>
the constestants prior to the championship. As a result, there was <br>
much bigger diversity in methods and cubing styles.<br>
<br>
Today, people share all kinds of details, improve existing systems, <br>
help each other to get faster. That was not the case in 1982. Also, <br>
it is a lot smaller psychological barrier to improve from average 19 <br>
to 17 IF you know that there are 20 other people who did it before <br>
you. You pretty much know that if you put in sufficient number of <br>
energy and concentration, you are likely to get there. To get to <br>
15.4, of course, is another thing - that takes an immense talent and <br>
a HUGE amount of sweat.<br>
<br>
In 2003 WC there was much more actual cubing than in 1982. The <br>
conditions were much more fair than in 1982 - in 2003 we could have <br>
our own cubes and anybody could come and compete. In 1982, the stage <br>
was far more intimidating than in 2003. It was bigger, you were the <br>
only one there and the audience was bigger. Also, because the cube <br>
was at its peak popularity, stakes were kind of higher. So, if you <br>
were nervous in 2003, you can imagine the pressure in 1982 ... :)<br>
<br>
More below ...<br>
<br>
&gt; A number of this year&#x27;s finalists were<br>
&gt; people that were for the most part doing the same methods they were<br>
&gt; &gt;using 20 years ago.  From comments I&#x27;ve heard attributed to <br>
Jessica<br>
&gt; &gt;and David Allen, they were both &quot;faster&quot; 20 years ago, but they&#x27;ve<br>
&gt; &gt;made slight improvements to their methods over time so net times <br>
are<br>
&gt; &gt;still fairly close.  So if Jessica is about as fast as she was <br>
in &#x27;82<br>
&gt; &gt;(or maybe a little slower) and she was middle of the pack in &#x27;82 <br>
and<br>
&gt; &gt;she was 2nd this year, what happened?  Was it luck, a different<br>
&gt; &gt;format, using your own cube, or slower competition?<br>
<br>
Well, first of all, I am now MUCH faster than I was in 1982. In 1982 <br>
I was averaging about 23 seconds. In June 1982, I have owned the <br>
cube for a mere 10 months! I was at my peak in 1983 and I have not <br>
really changed my method since then. So, the different placement <br>
then and this year does not mean anything ;)<br>
<br>
It would be very interesting to know how fast the contestants were <br>
(average) in 1982. Does anyone have this info? I think somebody was <br>
taking statistics at the championship regarding the methods and our <br>
performance. I remember that the corners-first method was more <br>
frequent among contestants in 1982 than the by-layer approach.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It does take about a million years of practicing. But once you get 
down there, it&#x27;s probably really easy. I remember when I thought it 
would be sooo cool to be able to average under a minute. LOL

it is really insane...(i.e. David allen&#x27;s and Gene&#x27;s finger tricks 
for another).  and who can forget Chris&#x27; &#x27;one hand&#x27; solves?  so much 
supremecy...  and those blindfold guyz (i think Orser) tried 10

<br>
  I think that cubers are much faster today than in June of 1982. It <br>
  is because of all the sharing done via the Internet and the computer-<br>
  generated algorithms. Back in 1982 there was no communication among <br>
  the constestants prior to the championship. As a result, there was <br>
  much bigger diversity in methods and cubing styles.<br>
<br>
  Today, people share all kinds of details, improve existing systems, <br>
  help each other to get faster. That was not the case in 1982. Also, <br>
  it is a lot smaller psychological barrier to improve from average 19 <br>
  to 17 IF you know that there are 20 other people who did it before <br>
  you. You pretty much know that if you put in sufficient number of <br>
  energy and concentration, you are likely to get there. To get to <br>
  15.4, of course, is another thing - that takes an immense talent and <br>
  a HUGE amount of sweat.<br>
<br>
  In 2003 WC there was much more actual cubing than in 1982. The <br>
  conditions were much more fair than in 1982 - in 2003 we could have <br>
  our own cubes and anybody could come and compete. In 1982, the stage <br>
  was far more intimidating than in 2003. It was bigger, you were the <br>
  only one there and the audience was bigger. Also, because the cube <br>
  was at its peak popularity, stakes were kind of higher. So, if you <br>
  were nervous in 2003, you can imagine the pressure in 1982 ... :)<br>
<br>
  More below ...<br>
<br>
  &gt; A number of this year&#x27;s finalists were<br>
  &gt; people that were for the most part doing the same methods they were<br>
  &gt; &gt;using 20 years ago.  From comments I&#x27;ve heard attributed to <br>
  Jessica<br>
  &gt; &gt;and David Allen, they were both &quot;faster&quot; 20 years ago, but they&#x27;ve<br>
  &gt; &gt;made slight improvements to their methods over time so net times <br>
  are<br>
  &gt; &gt;still fairly close.  So if Jessica is about as fast as she was <br>
  in &#x27;82<br>
  &gt; &gt;(or maybe a little slower) and she was middle of the pack in &#x27;82 <br>
  and<br>
  &gt; &gt;she was 2nd this year, what happened?  Was it luck, a different<br>
  &gt; &gt;format, using your own cube, or slower competition?<br>
<br>
  Well, first of all, I am now MUCH faster than I was in 1982. In 1982 <br>
  I was averaging about 23 seconds. In June 1982, I have owned the <br>
  cube for a mere 10 months! I was at my peak in 1983 and I have not <br>
  really changed my method since then. So, the different placement <br>
  then and this year does not mean anything ;)<br>
<br>
  It would be very interesting to know how fast the contestants were <br>
  (average) in 1982. Does anyone have this info? I think somebody was <br>
  taking statistics at the championship regarding the methods and our <br>
  performance. I remember that the corners-first method was more <br>
  frequent among contestants in 1982 than the by-layer approach.<br>

          <div class="email-content">well, people tend to not like to hear this, but the plain and simple 
truth is that a lot of it is simply born talent.  your genetics have 
a lot to do with how easily you can get to sub-20.  some people&#x27;s 
brains have high spacial IQ, some people have lower spacial IQ.  
some people have tremendous natural finger dexterity, others do 
not.  you cannot teach yourself to increase your spacial IQ because 
it is something you are born with.  however, you can increase your 
finger dexterity, but the *rate* at which your dexterity increases 
with practice is something that you are born with.  some people 
learn motor skills quickly, others not so quickly.

that doesn&#x27;t mean that if your spacial IQ is average that you can&#x27;t 
be a fast cuber.  but you&#x27;ll have to practice a lot more than 
someone with a high spacial IQ.  spacial IQ is most involved with 
planning the formation of the cross and then following the pieces 
around during f2l.  and then the LL is less affected by spacial IQ 
and more affected by finger dexterity.

there is a cool free IQ test at http://www.emode.com/tests/uiq that 
is actually pretty accurate.  you&#x27;ll find that some of the questions 
are easy and some are pretty hard.  and it has a subsection for 
spacial-visual IQ.  you get your total IQ score for free, but if you 
want to read the subsection reports, then you have to pay a small 
fee.

people who get sub-20 cube times within a year of picking up the 
cube probably have a spacial-visual IQ in the top 5 percentile.  i 
took this test and scored an IQ of 142, and i&#x27;d suspect most people 
on this board probably have similar IQ scores.

i thought you said earlier that next year&#x27;s new studio cubes were 
going to be of lower quality than the ones you&#x27;ve had for sale due 
to manufacturing cost cuts, crooked screws, etc.  did rubiks studio 
decide to make a higher quality cube this year?  is it higher 
quality than the cubes we bought last year, or the same quality?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve seen that test before, and I think that it&#x27;s fairly inaccurate. 
It says something like a normal human has 110, and a genius is 130 
or above. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone get below 140, and I&#x27;ve seen 
several people&#x27;s scores.
But I think that the cube probably does have a lot to do with how 
the brain you get when you&#x27;re born. anyone could learn well enough 
to get as good as any genius, but it would probably be harder.

<br>
Okay, since you mentioned me, I&#x27;ll respond :P  Really, for the <br>
megaminx, it was a ton of practice, and working out my own, new <br>
algs.  The first time I solved a megaminx, it took about 40 minutes.  <br>
After I had a solution down, it was still taking me 7-8 minutes at <br>
best.<br>
<br>
To further improve, I played with different approaches to find out <br>
what worked best for me.  After a long time working on it, though, my <br>
puzzle moves better than most, and I&#x27;ve gotten very used to what <br>
color is where on the puzzle.  Lately, even though I haven&#x27;t been <br>
practicing the megaminx much, I continue to improve gradually as my <br>
general cubing improves.  I have one further goal in learning on the <br>
megaminx, and that is to orient last layer corners in 1 look.  Then, <br>
I&#x27;ll just keep practicing, and hope that I&#x27;m still in the running <br>
when the next WC comes around.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have talked to the finacial Director of the Rubik&#x27;s Studio and he 
ensured me that they resolved all problems and made some 
improvements. The poor quality was caused because they decided to 
move production to Rusia. But now is everything back to the old style 
production. I have to test the new style cubes, before I can make any 
quality statements. But I think that it will be as good as the old 
style cubes and maybe even better!

&gt;I think somebody was<br>

<br>
Singmaster did that, and his old Cubic Circulars are online. The 1982 <br>
WC is described on pages 4-7 of this <br>

the rest.<br>

He also says that the contestants described the cubes as &#x27;pretty <br>
good&#x27;, but that may have been more polite than factual, perhaps on <br>
the side of the contestants as well as Singmaster.<br>

Yes, it did say that, didn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s not true at all, I won it in <br>
40.43 seconds. I may have mentioned that I did 24 seconds on average <br>
to someone, and they passed that on. Or someone just made it up.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone...<br>
<br>
Here is my long awaited message concerning the WC. I&#x27;m sure a lot of <br>
you have been wondering about me...  hehe.. I had a blast in <br>
Toronto!! Unfortunately I had to leave the city and head back home, <br>
thus taking me away from a ton of new friends. Shoot, 15 people make <br>
a ton.... make that &quot;tons&quot;. I walked away with a totally new outlook <br>
on the cube, thanks to so many conversations with people who have <br>
their own unique perspectives on the cube. A lot of people have <br>
talked about how well we got along and that we all bonded so easily. <br>
That has to be due to the fact that the cube has just made us happy <br>
people. A happiness which has come to each of us through those <br>
individuals that we have in turn made happy. Over the past year or <br>
more, we have all cubed for strangers, crowds, family, students, and <br>
coworkers so much that we have made hundreds of people smile, laugh, <br>
and just plain excited over something that everyone has a strong, if <br>
not, passion for. The elusive cube, which no one can solve. Sure, I <br>
used to peel the stickers off, (too bad I didn&#x27;t know that it <br>
actually would not break if I forced it apart), but about 99.99% of <br>
the general public pretty much &quot;freak out&quot; when we solve the cube for <br>
them. <br>
<br>
So, for me, I kept thinking of that when I met each one of you... I <br>
didn&#x27;t speak much of it, though. <br>
<br>
I always wanted to see a fast solve &quot;in person&quot; right before my <br>
eyes... But in all actuality, it was not too much more impressive <br>
than a video file online. The speed is surely something to behold, <br>
but no more clarity or ease of viewing is available in a real life <br>
setting. This was somewhat disappointing, since it was my original <br>
reason for becoming excited about the WC. Chris Hardwick&#x27;s solving <br>
video was amazing to me over 2 years ago... But Chris less than 2 <br>
weeks ago, was the same blurry mess of fingers and plastic. I guess I <br>
can&#x27;t complain too much about that. For it was awe inspiring <br>
nonetheless.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing for me was that I didn&#x27;t recognize a lot of people&#x27;s <br>
names when I met them, due to my extended absence from this club and <br>
all other online sites. So, I had no biased opinions about anyone <br>
that did not fall into the &quot;famous&quot; category. For instance, Frank <br>
Morris and Dan Harris were just ordinary people with cubes in their <br>
hands when I met them. I could tell that they were solving much <br>
faster than me indeed. It was only that night when I got online did I <br>
see the extent to which I underestimated their potential. <br>
<br>
The reason I even say this here is because it shows how easy it was <br>
for me and perhaps a lot of us to just becomes friends first. I never <br>
said, &quot;Wow, Frank, it&#x27;s nice to meet you!! Dude, how&#x27;d you get so <br>
fast??!!!&quot;.  It was more of a &quot;Hey, wasssup?!!?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, that was my ramblings....<br>
<br>
I will have my hundreds of photos sorted and online ASAP... I&#x27;m too <br>
busy scrapping my old system and relearning all my algs... there&#x27;s <br>
not enuf days until wc2005.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, in Nature speed of light is the limit and nothing goes beyond 
it. As fr as those mechanical puzzles are  concerned, ity depends on 
the puzzle and the puzzler. The puzzle should be conditioned to move 
fast, and the puzzler  should be operating it fast. If those two 
criteria are satisfied, you can get fantasatic rewsuylts. If not, 
consider switching to cube art. :-)

have an 86 also)..., unless you&#x27;d like to do this also. 86 actaully 
has a much more compact and simpler programing language (thus maybe 
more error pron), but I prefer that.

This is encouraging some in-class cubing which is bad, btw. I&#x27;d be 
using it on the bus a lot and while studing or doing hw...

          <div class="email-content">For the one handed stuff I have to agree with Grant in that it was, 
for me at least, just lots and lots and lots of practice.  I started 
by just trying to find more efficient ways to do the normal moves, 
clockwise and counter clockwise on each face.  Then after I felt 
comfortable with that I came up with the &quot;finger tricks&quot; that I 
mentioned in my last post by simply trying to do moves with my 
fingers instead of always alternating finger/thumb/finger/thumb.  By 
practicing a lot I also noticed that my times got faster simply 
because my hand was getting stronger.  Also by practicing a lot, 
hence making your hand a little stronger, it becomes easier to do 
even more kinds of &quot;finger tricks&quot;.  Then the next step was to 
practice each OLL and PLL to find the fastest ways to do each one 
with only the use of one hand.  That also helped to make sure I 
would get &quot;amnesia&quot; less often, a nuisance which still comes up (I 
got one handed amnesia for the OLL of my second solve at the WC).  I 
guess I decided to put a lot of time into it after breaking Matt 
Wilder&#x27;s time of 48 seconds.  I remember thinking that it would be 
almost impossible to get that fast, then after practicing off and on 
for a while I finally got it!  I couldn&#x27;t believe that I was able to 
do it, and each time I set a new record I always noticed something 
else that I could improve on.  That started the whole snowball 
effect for my times.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much a question of inherent dexterity and 
visual spacial skill, at least for one handed, but more a question 
of just lots and lots of practice to improve your dexterity and your 
hand strength.

That&#x27;s just my two cents.  I know its the piece of advice that no 
one likes to hear, but at least for one handed it is all about lots 
of practice.

          <div class="email-content">It was the same for me. My first one handed time was around eight 
minutes, when I was just joking around. I didn&#x27;t actually plan on 
getting good at it.

I think that being fast at the cube has a lot to do with brains, but 
if you&#x27;re a genius but don&#x27;t have good dexterity, you won&#x27;t ever be 
tremendously good. And vice versa.

BTW, Chris, about the finger tricks you talked about in your last 
post. I found out that when I&#x27;m actually going quickly one handed, 
my hands are never in the right position to use that. They&#x27;re never 
in the right position to use any finger other than my thumb or first 
finger. It&#x27;s probably just a habit I picked up as I learned to go 
fast. Did you encounter this?

          <div class="email-content">Well, earlier Ian Winokur asked me for a copy, so I finished making 
sure everything works and made it nice and neat and so forth.  It&#x27;s 
still my first prog in a long while though.  So be kind.

As for the 86, I honestly have no experience with it, and I don&#x27;t 
have access to one.  I would be very pleased if you guys found a way 
to port it over there though!

I&#x27;ll post the final (for now) version in the files section under 
89timer.zip

As for in class cubing?  Well, MWF I have 3-1 hour blocks between 
classes, perfect for cubing (or writing a cube program on your calc, 
or reading Douglas Adams&#x27; Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul, etc.)  
Besides, I think the teacher would notice...

Hehehe, Disclaimer, you get in trouble using it in class, your fault!

Have fun though!

          <div class="email-content">Hi All, <br>
<br>
Sorry for my long absence. <br>
WC was the last event of my American life. <br>
I had to move to Japan. So it took time to set up everything. <br>
I am getting started new life. <br>
Now I can&#x27;t keep hiding anymore. <br>
<br>
Thanks to DanG and everyone else! <br>
<br>
It was really wondeful meeting not just because I could win. <br>
Everybody seemed my old friend eventhough this was our first meeting. <br>
I really enjoyed watching everybody solving cube and sharing time. <br>
<br>
I regret I could not take a lot of pictures because my digital camera <br>
has broken. But how nice! I can see the pictures several people <br>
posted on their web sites. Thanks to those who post their pictures. <br>
<br>
Even 2 years later, I will be still as old as Jessica, David A, and <br>
Gene are. <br>
I am going to try to get much faster,<br>
 and really wish to get together with you guys again. <br>
Hope to meet again in WC2005 wherever. <br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt;well, people tend to not like to hear this, but the plain and simple<br>
&gt;truth is that a lot of it is simply born talent.<br>
<br>
One reason I don&#x27;t like hearing this is because taken alone it is open to <br>
misinterpretation. Without certain qualifiers (you add them) people take on <br>
a fatalist approach towards their potential, which is very frustrating.  As <br>
you say, it more reflects on how easy it is to do something, not whether you <br>
can do it at all.  Of course this does not apply to the extremes of the <br>
scale: the very low and very high IQs.<br>
<br>
&gt;your genetics have<br>
&gt;a lot to do with how easily you can get to sub-20.<br>
<br>
Sure, but for most of us I wonder how much our IQ is influenced by our <br>
environment in the first few years of our lives?  Heaps, I suspect.  Of <br>
course, this factor is also pretty much beyond our control, as it all <br>
happens before we hit about 12 years of age.<br>
<br>
&gt;that doesn&#x27;t mean that if your spacial IQ is average that you can&#x27;t<br>
&gt;be a fast cuber.<br>
<br>
A crucial point.<br>
<br>
&gt;there is a cool free IQ test at http://www.emode.com/tests/uiq that<br>
&gt;is actually pretty accurate.<br>
<br>
Accurate compared to what?  I don&#x27;t regard this test as highly as your post <br>
suggests, I&#x27;m afraid.<br>
<br>
&gt;i&#x27;d suspect most people<br>
&gt;on this board probably have similar IQ scores.<br>
<br>
A while ago a load of us did some online IQ test: I recall the average was <br>
around the 150/160 mark.<br>

Well, you can get stickers from http://www.rubikshop.com , but at <br>
$4.99 for 3 sets, that would cost $67 plus shipping.  Also, these are <br>
supposed to be the good stickers (like they had available at the <br>
competition), but you may want to check before sinking any money into <br>
them.  I suppose for your purposes, it&#x27;s probably not as big of a <br>
deal, though, since you&#x27;re not solving each cube dozens-100&#x27;s of <br>
times per day like us crazy speed-cubists, so the stickers shouldn&#x27;t <br>
wear off on you.<br>

          <div class="email-content">And speedcubing with the feet most probably requires the same thing as 
doing it with one hand: you have to practice a lot...

I solved the cube with my feet the first time some 20 years or so ago 
when I got tired of doing it two-handed, with one hand, with the other 
hand... As I remember, I did it only once or twice at that time, and I 
didn&#x27;t measured the time it took. When Andrea Craig of Strategic 
Objectives contacted Rune and me for promotions of the WC, she asked 
about my cube peculiarities, I happened to mention that I had done it 
with my feet. And she could not resist to persuade me to do it live on 
the CityTV Breakfast Television show on the Friday morning. And the rest 
is history... Before I agreed to do it on TV, I had to try it again and 
this time it took 1/2 h or more, since you easily get lost in the 
sequences. When I got the idea how to work it out, it took less than 15 
minutes.

When foot-cubing at the WC Banquet 
&lt;http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/wc2003/banquet.html#pic7> I solved 
the cube in more than 12 minutes, after embarrassing myself for some 
minute during the placement of the last edges. I have only solved the 
cube with my feet 10 time or so. With just a little more practice I 
should be able to do it securely within 10 minutes. With some serious 
practice, it should be no problem to beat 5 minutes. See you at WC2005 ;-)

   For how long have the &quot;Made in Hungary&quot; Rubik&#x27;s Studio Cubes been
made in Russia?

   It is good news about the improvements, and the caps not being
glued on. Can you list the improvements incorporated into the new cubes?

Hi Dan!<br>
The after-effect og the time-leg has gone...<br>
I had hoped to have some words with you at the WC, but scrambling <br>
cubes, talking to Jessica and other stars you seemed untouchable for <br>
ordinary mortals. I have nothing to add to what already has been <br>
said, everything was splendid. Even the delay on Saturday I took as a <br>
relief; I got tired looking at all those speed-cubers and hoped to <br>
start in good form on Sunday. Alas, I had intensively been training <br>
with a &quot;podium&quot; four feet high, but when it all came around it was <br>
only three feet. I´m joking, Dan. For bad times I can only blame bad <br>
nerves and slow fingers and brain. A poor consolation is the fact that<br>
even a man as Jess Bonde in a fit of nervousness could have a time <br>
about 50 secs. (By no means, I´m not comparing myself with him!) An <br>
unpleasant surprise was that the cube was covered after inspection. <br>
With my short memory I forgot the orientation and got still more <br>
frustrated.<br>
Maybe I should mention one thing. In the smoker-room, that is <br>
outdoors, on Sunday evening, a couple of hours before the Big battle <br>
indoors I saw a Japaneese showing his fingertricks. THAT was <br>
fantastic to me. Can that man really be much slower than David Allen?<br>
Anyhow, his name ought to be known.<br>
<br>
Well, Dan, thank you for two unforgettable days!<br>
Rune<br>

I am not sure I guess from begining of this year, I always check the 
quality of the cube once in two months. Since feb this year I notice 
a drop in quality, in march I notice that about 10% of the cubes had 
some failures. So I decided to test and check all cubes before 
sending. In April I received 20 cubes with 50% failures. So I decided 
to stop selling the new type and sold my stock of 2001 versions 
instead. 

The new cubes will have a screw with a ring, it has the old style 
plastic. As soon as I have tested the cube I can list all the 
difference.

          <div class="email-content">The only problem with the Rubiks.com cubes is the stickers. The ones 
with a plasticky film over them are awwwwful, and they wear away in 
a matter of days for speedcubers.
Without those stickers, they would be fine. Except that they don&#x27;t 
have a screw, but I&#x27;ve never had trouble with that.

good. Else I can offer Rubik&#x27;s Arxon Cube (1980) versions, they are 
extreemly good for speedcubing.

          <div class="email-content">As I stated the Rubiks.com cube are fine if you do not need any 
special tuning. But with a Rubik&#x27;s Studio you can tune the screws so 
that all faces turns the same. And you can make it stiff or loose and 
adjust it to your technique, after it wears down, you can adjust the 
screws, this is not possible with a Rubiks.com cube. Still the 
stickers remains a problem with the Rubiks.com cube.

Hi Dan,

   2005 Big Anniversary in Europe. Cool. Lots of people will
undoubtedly put in lots of practice for it. 

   From the spirited responses to the championships I&#x27;d to say that
they were an unqualified success. Congratulations!!! It was reported
in the media here.

   Your vacation is well deserved. Say hi to the penguins for me. :)

Hi everyone!

I have been in touch with Mirek and it is thanks to him that I am now able to present his World Championship winning solution along with comments from the master of Fewest Moves himself.

Check out www.cubestation.co.uk and click on the &quot;blow-by-blow account&quot; link in the news section on the front page. It is amazing stuff!

          <div class="email-content">There is a very simple method that you can solve it with, but not 
quickly. It&#x27;s basically everyone&#x27;s method of solving big cubes. You 
first solve all the centers, then the edges, then only twist the 
outer layers and pretend it&#x27;s a big 3x3x3.
There&#x27;s also probably one here: 
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/ But I haven&#x27;t checked it 
out.

          <div class="email-content">All the fastest cubists at 5x5 (with the exception of Akimoto) use 
the centers, pair-up edges, and finish as a 3x3 approach. You can 
catch the parity errors early for the 5x5 since you can judge it by 
the middle edge piece.... this allows for some flexiblity in fixing 
it, i.e. deep-slicing instead of single slices. Many also solve 
centers in opposite pairs, cutting down on piece-seeking. Chris told 
me he does two opposites, then one more and the last three in 
whatever way&#x27;s most efficent. For these larger cubes, you have a 
chance to be creative and figure out some algorithms and variations 
of this system yourself. It&#x27;s more fun that way. Oh, and fyi, there 
is no solution specific to the 5x5 on the web...., well perhaps 
Jaap, since he has &quot;everything,&quot; but probably not too specificly 
designed. If you solve it enough, you&#x27;ll develop some 5x5 intuition 
that will greatly improve your times..., when I first started doing 
the 5x5, it took me 35 minutes. Now it takes me much less time..., 
hard to measure since my 5x5 is still very stiff (I&#x27;ll keep you 
posted).

          <div class="email-content">I just went through a couple of solves and I noticed that my 
standard grip is to hold the cube with only my thumb and middle 
finger, with my thumb on the F face center and middle finger on the 
B face center.  I also delibrately extend my ring finger away from 
the cube unless I&#x27;m doing moves with it.  This leaves your hands 
almost always in the position to use your index and ring fingers in 
those kinds of triggers.  I do know what you mean though in that it 
seems like only your thumb and index finger can do moves, I 
definitely felt that way as well.  Try just practicing holding the 
cube with only your thumb and middle finger, see if that helps 
some.  The goal is to hold the cube with as few fingers as possible, 
and turn the faces with as many as possible :)

          <div class="email-content">Regarding limits, you might be able to get some idea of what is <br>
possible by doing a little experiment that I posted a while ago.<br>
<br>
Take a solved cube and apply the following mixing alg:<br>
<br>
F&#x27;  L  B  R  U  B&#x27;  R&#x27;  D  U  R  L2  D  R  F2  D  R2  L&#x27;  F  D&#x27;  L  <br>
U&#x27;  F&#x27;  U&#x27;  B&#x27;  L2  <br>
<br>
Solve it over and over, using your speedsolving method, as opposed <br>
to just doing the mix in reverse.  <br>
<br>
The idea is that you will eventually attain the desired state for a <br>
good solve (no delays between algs, near zero case recognition <br>
times, no delays of any sort really).<br>
<br>
While doing multiple solves, you will undoubtedly find that you can <br>
insert setup moves for later steps while completing earlier steps <br>
(i.e., assembling an edge corner pair while making the cross for F2L <br>
method, or inserting an edge or 2 while solving corners in corners <br>
first).  This might simulate a state of mind where you are actually <br>
doing automatic solves of earlier stages while setting up and <br>
preparing for later steps.  <br>
<br>
Just for fun, I would like to see what times people get with this <br>
exercise, especially those who are already freakishly fast.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I realize that this is just a speed solve <br>
simulation, but it might give some clues as to what ultimate speed <br>
solving would feel like, and perhaps give us some idea of what the <br>
lower time limit might be.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just tried this.

My real average is 47.27, with a fastest time of 35.49.  I am not 
that fast (yet).

First run with the standard scramble below was an average of 46.78, 
with a fastest time of 33.11, and a slowest of 1:06.14

My second run was average 34.21, with a fastest of 29.22, and 
slowest of 39.91

for the top cubers, can you break a 0:13.00 average?

This is encouraging some in-class cubing which is bad, btw. I&#x27;d be

<br>
I have set-up some statistics on the Fewest Moves Challenge, and some of the results are quite interesting! Unfortunately it is still in the development stage, but most of the major stats are there, but I would love advice on how to improve this page (apart from the design perspective I can manage that on my won :D )<br>

There is a link on the front page of my website at www.cubestation.co.uk<br>

          <div class="email-content">What a very detailed reply Ryan!

Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m up to at the moment... I&#x27;ve learnt several LL edge 
algs -- ones that mess with the corners (which doesn&#x27;t matter if LL 
edges are oriented first). I already knew several LL edge algs that 
preserve the corners -- I guess these are useful if the corners are 
already done when you get to the LL.

I already know the Sune and its mirror (can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;d be any 
cuber who doesn&#x27;t know this alg?!). I&#x27;ve learnt the algs for the 
three LL corner orientation positions where 2 are corrent and 2 
require twisting. Still need to learn the 2 algs for when all 4 
require twisting.

I&#x27;m aiming to learn the 13 PLL if my enthusiasm lasts that long. In 
case it doesn&#x27;t, I planned the order that I would learn the algs. 
First I revised the algs that just move the edges since. I knew U and 
H, but for some reason was a bit iffy with Z. After that, I just 
ranked them by &#x27;probability of occurrence&#x27;. So, of the remaining 10, 
I&#x27;ve memorised the algs with a frequency of 1/9 or greater (A, R, J, 
G). So, 7 down, 6 more to go.

I think I need to take a break from new algs and spend some time 
getting the newly memorised algs firmly planted in my head. I&#x27;m 
finding that I can remember them without a problem, but I&#x27;m still 
taking a bit of time recognising the patterns. I&#x27;m not concerned 
though because I know that practise will fix this!

Jasmine.

from Seventowns..

Minds were never changed as everything was undecided and actually it 
still is undecided..

but yesterday i received notice from seventowns that a local event in 
europe will occure in 2004 and a major event in 2005 will also be on 
that side of the water...

more to come as i receive the info....you never know what can happen..

we might even have it in Aruba!!!
