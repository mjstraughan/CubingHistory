        corrected > I think I know the main issue now: When you click on an
        event, you make an AJAX request to the server. If it takes too long, you
        might get annoyed and request something else, and again a few more
        times.. These requests can come back in the wrong order (and the last
        one stays and gets displayed, possibly under the wrong event name). As
        the amount of information in round 1 (and the server load) increased, it
        took longer to load the times after a page load. If you clicked on any
        other event too fast, it would load -only for the times to be
        overwritten by 3x3x3 times. There were also a few minor bugs, mistakes,
        and test entries -I think Dan&#x27;s result is one of those. Despite the
        confusion, the results system worked very well, especially on our side.
        Rafal Studnicki did a great job on functionality and configurability.
        Hopefully, I can make it more robust and easy-to-use, so that it becomes
        a standard for West Coast competitions.

        Hi guys. Sorry for such a long delay; with the stress of finals, my
        computer breaking, and all sorts of other stuff, I haven&#x27;t been
        able to pay much attention to the competition. But there are a few
        noteworthy updates to be made: - Our venue has been finalized; our
        competition will take place in JES 121A. As the competition draws
        closer, we will put up specific directions about parking and how exactly
        to get to the venue. - I really have to apologize on this one.
        We&#x27;ve had a special arrangement with a local Doubletree Hotel for a
        rate of $129.00 per night per room (up to 4 people) and with breakfast
        included. Only problem is that the deadline is on 1/30/09, so if you
        want in on this deal you will have to hurry. There are many other hotels
        in the area that you are more than welcome to stay at though. - Someone
        emailed me earlier saying that they wanted to try 4x4x4 Blindfolded. For
        those of you who are interested, please email me at sapan.upadhyay@...,
        and if we have enough people we will go ahead and make that available at
        the competition. I think that&#x27;s all for now. If you haven&#x27;t
        registered for the competition yet and are planning on attending, please
        register here: http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/register.php . Other
        than that, I hope everyone had a great holiday, and see you guys at the
        competition! Thanks, -Sapan Upadhyay p.s. sorry if you get this email
        more than one time. [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Hi, This puzzle seems similar to a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but doesn&#x27;t
        require 3D thinking (and so might be more suitable for a 2d computer
        display): 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5
        5 5 6 6 6 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 7 7 7 8
        8 8 9 9 9 7 7 7 8 8 8 9 9 9 The objective is the same as Rubik&#x27;s
        cube: each grid must have only one number/color. You can rotate an
        entire row or column of 9 numbers, but rotations must be done 3 steps at
        a time. For example, rotating the second row to the right yields: 1 1 1
        2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 4 4 4

        I solved it before having to go on the air. It&#x27;s kind of silly...

        There aren&#x27;t really any videos of the solving process. The segment
        is online at the abc news website. It&#x27;s an interesting puzzle, but
        once you get one ball, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before you get
        the other 5. It&#x27;s actually like when people say, &quot;so now that
        I&#x27;ve solved one side, I just have to get the rest.&quot; Funny how

        Well i thought of using the WCA records page. check the averages of
        people, and then use the time they register to now as the time. But my
        teacher said she would like to see two equations. So I&#x27;m asking for
        the # of algorithms people know cause i just cant make up stuff. Oh and
        yeah this project is due in like two weeks but the process that is
        required is very time consuming. Asking people straight up seemed more
        beneficial cause I can get it from the person. Thanks all --- In

        I&#x27;m trying to find a definite relationship between the number of
        algorithms a person know as well as the time they have been speedcubing
        versus the first avg and current average solve times. Then calculate the
        probability of these relationships, find out if there similar to each
        other, whether on is more reliable to predict solving times, how this
        process can be applied to other situations ,and lastly find any
        obscurities in the data to find outliers plus graph all the above. That
        is why i need the data so early in my project cause I work most days
        after school and my work schedules changes every week. --- In

        Well, trying to use the WCA database was a good idea, but when that
        didn&#x27;t work, you should&#x27;ve modified so you could keep using
        the WCA database. What about being able to predict someone&#x27;s 4x4x4
        and 5x5x5 time by looking at their 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 times? --- In

        Go to your local dollar store and buy the ones with tiles. Not only are
        they darn near inpossible to turn, but the tiles may fall off as well.

        You can try sending them media mail, the cheapest rate (aka book rate).
        Just figure out what you&#x27;re spending on postage, add it up, and
        I&#x27;ll pay you a dollar per cube PLUS  a five-dollar Jamba Juice card
        I have lying around. You can&#x27;t really lose. As you can tell, I
        don&#x27;t have much time for thrift shopping, which is how I might have

        SO, i&#x27;m a new member. Hello everybody. I&#x27;m trying to decrease
        my time. I want to find a good speed cubing method. Call me a noob, but
        i only kmow the layer by layer method. We are having a cube contest at
        my school. I think i&#x27;m the only one who can solve the cube, but
        i&#x27;m pretty sure some people will learn how. I WANT TO WIN!!!!!!!
        But i don&#x27;t want to memorize a billion algs like the fridritch!
        AND, the petrus and similar are too difficult as well. Am i hopeless or
        is there a way? Or maybe someone could just explain a method better to
        me? I am appreciative of everything

        You can go fast with a beginner method. Just lots of practice. Try
        taking it slow, so you can spot what you need to do next, and it will
        help make your solve much smoother, reducing pause time Simba

        Hi, seems to me you are going to have to memorize some algs, but
        probably not 1,000,000,000 of them. While he does use Fridrich, I think
        Jason Thong has one of the best, easiest to follow sites out there. I
        would give him a look at http://www.jasacube.110mb.com/        He
        teaches to various different levels, and in a most effective manner.

        What is your current speed? I also only do layer by layer (still did not
        learn Fridrich) and was able to achieve 50-55 seconds if I just keep
        practicing ... and I think that it is possible to get faster just with
        the simple method if you can practice a lot. Just make sure that your
        cube is not too difficult to turn, and that you are trying to look ahead
        ... sometimes you&#x27;d need to slow down to look ahead, but with time
        it will pay off. How low are you trying to go exactly? --- On Wed,

        I saw picture of group cuber but not with him
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2YW5DhRjoE Popular video on youtube =
        link NO MORE A world of old cuber and unconscious hid his name before
        2003 simply to have little over-estimated the value of the high level
        cuber too much whereas the genius of teenager is enough to reach the
        world records. Answer simply why that its domain name is
        rubikscuberecord com is off and not for sale (Gaétan Guimond) and that
        it had a photograph of the national championship of 1982 on its site
        whereas the championship of the world returned to the same place in
        2003. Nobody had made a cube without looking before him. Here what no
        old cubists forever known as normal it there only Fridrich and Petrus
        which returned on the finalists of 1982 This world is sold in English
        the universal language but Gaetan was seen on fox TV by thousands of
        anybody and the impact was hidden. The cube is a symbol of frustration
        and it took the best way of causing the challenge of the play in the
        world. The intelligence and human quality deserve to be recognized. Come
        at his place to read the messages received on its hotmail you all will
        include/understand but to reflect should be enough. To invent a new fast
        method is not also difficult now since information is available in great
        number. A great lack of respect not for the cube 2x2x2 but well the
        corners of a cube that even nobody controls perfectly. To find more the
        small number of movement is its signature not the stop watch. The cube
        3x3x3 (rubik&#x27;s cube) is only one cube among the others but the
        corner is the heart of each cube. SYMBOL FRUSTRATION ...........THE CUBE

        Hi there, I&#x27;m looking for good generic lubricants. I should be

        I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to archive the group? You&#x27;re right
        that this group isn&#x27;t particularly active anymore, and there&#x27;s
        a lot of spam coming in, but it&#x27;d be a real shame if everything
        here was lost/deleted. For many years this group was the most active
        cube discussion group in the world, and there&#x27;s lots of great
        memories here. This group is one of the main reasons I got back into
        cubing after about a 15 year break (I cubed back in the late 1980s), and
        my renewed interest led me to end up in Toronto in 2003 for Worlds.
        Being at Worlds 2003 meant I met a lot of great new friends, got a lot
        of inspiration to learn more about the cube, and ended up travelling
        around the world to other competitions. Yes, many fond memories of this
        discussion group and what it has led to. :) Jasmine --- In

        I&#x27;ll moderate for Canada! I will miss this group if we do close it
        down. It&#x27;s a great source for cubing talk, but I also think that
        these spam messages is getting out of hand. Like, &quot;Fat burning

        This group is becoming more and more redundant. I cannot recall the last
        time a genuinely interesting topic was brought up. The only decent cube
        forums (i know of - english ones) are http://www.twistypuzzles.com and
        http://www.speedsolving.com They are genuine forums and not mailgroups,
        like this one. They have dedicated subforums and active moderators.
        I&#x27;d say the first one is more collectors/building oriented while
        the second is more geared towards speedsolvers - as the name correctly
        indicates. I do not think introducing message approval would make this
        group any better or more active. It is dying merely due to lack of
        features ... Coincidentally, i also read that emailing in general is
        dying. Especially amongst youger people. Other ways of communicating are
        more important for them ;-) (email is slow!) Per > --- In

        channel. Basically you will be able to play Rubiks on your wii for a few
        dollars and post your time on leaderboard. There will also be
        additionally brand new puzzle games inspired by the Rubiks Cube logics.

        You will get better responses at speedsolving.com. There is at least 1
        good YouTube video explaining an efficient way to finish the last 2
        centers of big cubes. There are different ways to do edge pairing. (I
        only solve 2 pairs at a time, restoring centers after each solve. The
        faster cubers like Yu solve a few edges at the same time using
        horizontal slices and setup/setdown moves, and eventually restore the
        horizontal slices.) You probably already know how to fix OLL parity and
        PLL parity and then 3x3 solve. Watch the recent video of Yu Nakajima
        solving 7x7 in under 4 minutes. --- In

        http://grrroux.free.fr/ FOR step 1, PICK ONE BLOCK!!! and then just
        start solving that block over and over again. By doing the same block
        repeatedly, you get used to doing the first step efficiently. I use the
        White Block with white on left, Orange on bottom, green in front and
        blue in back. Then expand to where you can do 1 of 2 blocks
        (white/orange and white/red maybe) Then expand to where you can do 1 of
        4 blocks (w/o and w/r and y/o and y/r) THen for every solve, you will
        have 4 good configurations which are all similar. It quadruples your
        probability of getting a good solve for step 1. step 1 is the most
        important step, just like c is most important to cfop.

        I use a thick silicone grease that is made to seal O-rings in SCUBA
        equipment. It lasts a bit longer than the silicone sprays I have used,
        but it also doesn&#x27;t dry as fast or lubricate as much. I like my
        cubes a bit mushy though, so it works for me. Also, don&#x27;t forget
        the subject in your sentences; you might sound like you haven&#x27;t got
        a clue while jokingly telling others that it doesn&#x27;t seem like they
        have a clue (thereby ruining your joke! For shame)... Unless, of course,
        you are aware that there is technically a zero subject of sorts(perhaps
        a common feature in your idiolect), which would give you a basis to tell
        off annoying internet trolls who point out your silly technical error.
        Unfortunately, this would require you to set the standard of English
        grammar and spelling of the message group to something very similar to
        your particular idiolect so that the aforementioned trolls would not be
        able to pull similar arguments against you (something like: &quot;Well,
        in American English (and my idiolect), the second &quot;i&quot; in
        silicone is commonly pronounced as either the I OR schwa from the
        International Phonetic Alphabet. Many words have an &quot;a&quot; in
        them that is pronounced like schwa (as the &quot;a&quot; in cymbal), so
        it is understandable and logical that I might make an error and spell
        out &quot;silacone&quot;&quot;. (among other reasons why one might
        misspell a word)) Etc. Enjoy the troll food.

        condition to pop or have any internal mechanism previously broken. So if
        anyone has an extra one that you do not need or which you are willing to
        sell, please reply to my email. Note that i live in singapore so please

        J&#x27;ai eu un élève qui a 28 ans environ et un diplôme
        d&#x27;ingénieur civil grade sup. Quand il était adolescent (15 ans), il
        résolvait le cube (27) en moins d&#x27;une minute, celui à 64 entre 1 et
        2 min, l&#x27;horloge rubik pareil. Je ne connais pas sa méthode. Mais
        il a une mémoire et un raisonnement qui sortent de l&#x27;ordinaire et
        il retient tous les coups réussis ou échoués antérieurs. Son nom :
        GLINEUR et est originaire de QUIEVRAIN en Belgique. Pour ma part,
        j&#x27;ai toujours (prof de math retraité) eu des difficultés avec ce

        Bonjour Gaetan Guimond. Nous sommes les personnes vous ayant demandé de
        nous joindre à votre liste de contact (par erreur). Nous sommes deux
        jeunes français accrochés à leurs cubes de 5 à 6 heures par jour (record
        de 38 secondes à 15 ans) et nous avons vu vos vidéos impressionnantes(
        une vingtaine de fois). Nous avons tenté d&#x27;apprendre votre méthode
        de résolution mais il y a un algorithme que nous ne comprenons pas.
        L&#x27;algorithme des 2 groupes de 2 de la 3ème étape (A2 B2 B2 A2). A2
        B2 B2 A2 reviens à ne rien faire. Mais c&#x27;est sûrement nous qui
        avons un problème de lecture. Nous avons aussi une dernière question à
        vous poser. Vous arrivez à faire un cube dans votre dos en moins de 30
        secondes. Alors pourquoi n&#x27;avez vous pas participé au championnat
        du monde de l&#x27;an dernier? Vous auriez été le champion du monde de
        cette catégorie, non? Nous avons vu d&#x27;autres vidéos de résolution
        blinfold, mais elles paraissent toutes ridicules par rapport aux vôtres.
        Nous sommes désolé pour le dérangement. Au plaisir d&#x27;avoir pu vous

        considered The behind the back solves look impressive, but unless I see
        the feat done in person, with a 3rd party scrambling an unfamiliar cube
        (to avoid tactile cues from a familiar cube), I cannot dismiss the
        possiblity that the feat is done with a pre set cube. There was some
        magician at the RWC who had a &quot;mixed&quot; cube and had this trick
        where he asked me to do one more turn on the cube and hand it back to
        him. He then asked me to pick a number, then proceeded to do a behind
        the back &quot;solve&quot; of the cube in the same number of turns as
        the number I picked. Impressive? Yes and no. The odd magician guy at the
        RWC pretty much unscrambled the cube rather than solving it in a step by
        step manner. I would guess that he has a rehearsed unscrambling alg of a
        fixed number of moves, and a few holding pattern algs that he can insert
        so that his total number of moves equaled my given number. How do I know
        that he unscrambled the cube rather than solve it? First of all, his
        cube was in horrendous condition, and felt like it was lubed with pine
        tar. No self respecting cuber would stand for using a crap cube like
        that. Secondly, There was no solving method apparent. The cube was mixed
        then it was solved. No F2L, No layer by layer, no Petrus, no corners
        first. I should have had him attempt a regular solve on a real cube to
        confirm that the guy probably doesn&#x27;t know how to even solve the
        cube. Gaetan is actually solving the cube behind his back, and doing so
        rather skillfuly. This is impressive even if it is rehearsed. On the
        other hand, if the feat is real and unrehearsed, then there is no actual
        reason for anyone else to actually work on blindfold solves, as it would
        be futile to try to do better than Gaetan. I understand that blindfold
        solving entails memorizing the position and orientation of every cubie,
        executing a step, then reassessing and memorizing the O/P of the cubies,
        doing another small step that affects only a few cubies, reassessing and
        memorizing, and so on. Looking at Gaetan&#x27;s videos, I see no
        evidence of this process. It looks a lot to me like a straight solve. Hi
        Gaetan, I think you sent me email a few years ago talking about your
        Rubik&#x27;s Cube talent. I finally saw your videos today, very
        impressive! I am still working on my Rubik&#x27;s Cube book, and I have
        gathered as much information on cubes as I could at http://cubeman.org I
        must admit, I don&#x27;t understand how you can solve it behind your
        back. I can solve the cube behind my back from a lot of different
        patterns, but not from a random state. I see on your web page you talk
        about the Toronto Championships in 1982. This must be at the Ontario
        Science Centre, right ? Is this the time you hurt your hand and could
        not compete, back in 1982? Mark Longridge Thx very much but my hurt hand
        only before my prestation 1993 ( october 1992) Gosbee, fracture / arm in
        1982, liar and chief organisator WC 2003 (Toronto). Bad exemple. Have
        you ever seen another picture of the 1982 national championship on the
        web ? Before me there was only Dan Knights with 20-seconds performance
        on TV Have you ever seen a person who solve the cube behind his back in
        30 seconds blindfolded on TV with VIEWERS magic or no ? M.Gosbee Where

        records of juggling or magic also have much respect for those which have
        creativity on scene. The world of cuber record does not have to realize

        had in mind, though. In 1995, I put my page up with my only intent - to

        fois). Nous avons tenté d&#x27;apprendre votre méthode de résolution

        ne rien faire. Mais c&#x27;est sûrement nous qui avons un problème de
        lecture. Nous avons aussi une dernière question à vous poser. Vous
        arrivez à faire un cube dans votre dos en moins de 30 secondes. Alors
        pourquoi n&#x27;avez vous pas participé au championnat du monde de
        l&#x27;an dernier? Vous auriez été le champion du monde de cette

        Hey guys, So I just wanted to let everyone who doesn&#x27;t already know
        that the 2009 Dallas Open will be taking place on June 13, 2009 at the
        Hyatt Regency Dallas:
        http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/2009dallasopen.php Most of the
        pertinent information should be up on the website. A few things to keep
        in mind are that there are available hotel rooms at a group rate ($99 a
        night), so if you are interested please check the website for more
        information. Also, if you are interested in competing, please
        pre-register (link is on the website) so that we can plan our events
        accordingly. I really hope many of you guys can make this competition.
        Texas and the surrounding states have many very talented cubers, but

        oeil avouons-le incrédule je me suis rabattu par faim sur les vidéos et
        j&#x27;ai trouvé la deuxième proprement hallucinante ! Moi-même
        j&#x27;adore cet objet qu&#x27;est le rubik&#x27;s cube, et même si je
        m&#x27;en sers principalement comme passe temps, je tente parfois de

        fois). Nous avons tenté d&#x27;apprendre votre méthode de résolution

        des 2 groupes de 2 de la 3ème étape (A2 B2 B2 A2). A2 B2 B2 A2 reviens à
        ne rien faire. Mais c&#x27;est sûrement nous qui avons un problème de
        lecture. Nous avons aussi une dernière question à vous poser. Vous
        arrivez à faire un cube dans votre dos en moins de 30 secondes. Alors
        pourquoi n&#x27;avez vous pas participé au championnat du monde de
        l&#x27;an dernier? Vous auriez été le champion du monde de cette

        Hi all! We run a weekly contest in our brazilian cube forum
        (http://cubomagicobrasil.com) and we would like to download the
        scrambles automaticaly from the official scramblers, like
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/scramble_cube_222.html.
        I tried to do this simply with Excel access to web, but it didn´t work.
        Then I tried with Wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and it didn´t
        work either. Finally I tried doing a little program in C using Lynx
        (http://lynx.isc.org/), but it didn´t work again. I guess the problem is
        that the scrambles are generated from a script and these things I tried
        don´t get the script results. Does anyone have a solution to this? I
        would like to write something in VBA in Excel, but in C it would be nice
        as well. Thanks in advance! Rafael. 4º lugar no mundo com os pés!!

        Well, I don&#x27;t really have a good idea to do it fully automatically,
        but you could open the scrambler in a browser, let it show 95 scrambles
        (99 seems max), and copy+paste them to a text editor. From there it
        ought to be easy, and you&#x27;d need to do that only once every 19

        He he, ok! That&#x27;s a very good idea... I used to do that to scramble
        the square when I used Jnet and there wasn&#x27;t a square scrambler

      <div class="email-content">
        One thing that helped me was to learn special situations to add to my
        repertoire so to speak. I recommend to use things like empty slot cases,
        RUF style cases, and split pair solving. Some examples for cross on
        bottom solving. Do the inverse of the alg listed to setup the case. The
        algs listed are all to solve the case mentioned. Empty slot cases 1)
        Solve FL when FR is unsolved with cases like D R U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27;
        2) Solve FL when FR is unsolved with cases like D&#x27; L&#x27; U L D
        RUF style cases 1) Solve FR with R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;
        2) Solve BR with the BR edge in FR using R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R 3) Solve BR with the BR pair &quot;upside-down&quot; in FL
        using R&#x27; F U&#x27; F&#x27; R Split pair solving: This solves two
        different corner edge pairs at the same time. When to use this is when a
        corner is solved in one F2L slot, but not the edge. Also an edge is
        solved in a different slot but not the corner. There are small
        variations in these cases. 1) Orient a corner in one pair and an edge in
        another with D&#x27; R U&#x27; R U B U&#x27; B&#x27; R2 D 2) Orient a
        flipped corner in one slot, and insert the edge in the other slot with
        D&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; D 3) Pair up and solve
        the corner in one slot with the edge in the other with algs like D&#x27;
        U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F D There is also multislotting,
        where while solving a corner edge pair you prepare a second corner edge
        pair by either pairing it up, or pairing it up and solving both at the
        same time. I am a complete novice at this technique, but you can use
        google to find some tips on doing this. Those are of course only some
        examples, and there are other tricks besides just the ones I mentioned
        above. Start also playing around with block solving, starting with a
        2x2x2 then finishing the cross or maybe even Xcross. You can read more
        about block building techniques and Xcross here:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/f2l.html Consider a Petrus/Fridrich
        hybrid where you solve a 2x2x2, expand to the 2x2x3, orient edges, then
        solve the last F2L edge and continue with RU 2-gen solving. Another
        thing I often use is &quot;partial cross&quot; where you solve only part
        of the cross, then start solving corner edge pairs, and later on insert
        cross pieces with moves like M&#x27; U M or M&#x27; U2 M. Hope this
        helps point you in the right direction, Chris --- In

        Hi guys, Since everyone had such a great time at the *2009 Dallas Open*,
        we decided to bring all the excitement to another city before the summer
        ended. So I wanted to let everyone know that the *Texas Speedcubing
        Club* will be hosting the *2009 Houston Open* on *August 1st, 2009*. All
        of the relevant information and registration is available at:
        http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/2009houstonopen.php There is also a
        La Quinta Inn close to the venue which has set up a group rate at *$89 a
        night* . You can book a room by calling *(832) 595-6111* and telling
        them that you&#x27;re with the *Texas Speedcubing Club*. Keep in mind
        that this deal will only last until *July 17, 2009*, so if you plan on
        staying at the group rate, make sure to call in and reserve before then.
        I hope to see many of you there. As always, if you have any questions,
        feel free to email me at *sapan.upadhyay@...*. Thanks, -Sapan Upadhyay
        P.S. - For all of you who went to the *2009 Dallas Open* and have videos
        or articles online about it, it would be really awesome if you could add
        a link to it to the WCA page by using this link:
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/media_insertion.php .

        Gaetan, one week has passed since you posted about you being banned and
        NOBODY even bothered to react at all, let alone defend you. I hope this
        tells you something. I think it means you have no friends here, and the
        reason is that you&#x27;re plain annoying. All you ever do is post the
        same old discussions that nobody wants to read, the same old videos
        nobody wants to watch, and your random babbling making no sense. And you
        *always* interrupt, you never respond meaningfully to any conversation.
        That&#x27;s why I banned you from the speedsolving.com forum. I do
        apologize for not specifying a reason there, though I thought it was
        clear from your behaviour as well as from the warning I had sent you. In
        case you really missed it (though you should&#x27;ve received it both in
        the forum and as email), here it is again: > Hi Gaetan, > > please stop
        spamming. I&#x27;ve deleted your two recent spam posts. > You&#x27;re
        welcome to participate in the community in a good way, > but if you keep
        unrelatedly spamming with your videos and not > making any sense, expect
        a permanent ban. > > Stefan The lesson: Don&#x27;t misbehave in the
        first place, but if you do, don&#x27;t ignore such a warning. I banned
        you only after you continued spamming a few days after I had sent you
        the warning. If you promise to stop spamming and only join our
        conversations meaningfully, I&#x27;ll lift the ban. Cheers! Stefan ---

        Hey guys, So I just wanted to give everyone a few updates on the
        competition: 1. So just to be clear, the registration on the website (
        http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/2009houstonopen_register.php) is a
        pre-registration, and is *not* required. You are more than welcome to
        just register at the door, with no penalty. However, if you are planning
        on competing, we would much appreciate it if you did register in advance
        so that we know what to expect. 2. We initially decided to keep the
        number of events somewhat small, since we have a hard deadline by when
        we need to leave the venue. However, if we somehow get ahead of

        extra round to a popular event. Just wanted everyone to keep that in

        Hey guys, So there are a few quick announcements for the upcoming
        competition (less than 3 weeks away!): 1. After enough people asking
        about square-1, we&#x27;ve decided to add it on as a side event. So for
        anyone who wants to compete in square-1 and has already pre-registered,
        please email me at sapan.upadhyay@.... 2. For anyone who is coming to
        the competition who wants to take advantage of the discount rate at the
        hotel, remember that the last day for this is July 17 (this Friday). So
        make sure to take advantage of this if you&#x27;re interested. And of
        course, if you haven&#x27;t registered yet and are planning to come, you
        can pre-register at
        http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/2009houstonopen.php . And if you have
        any questions, feel free to email me at sapan.upadhyay@.... Thanks,

        1:50:44 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] 2009 Houston Open: Updates Hey
        guys, So I just wanted to give everyone a few updates on the
        competition: 1. So just to be clear, the registration on the website (
        http://texasspeedcubing.org/events/2009houstonopen_register.php) is a
        pre-registration, and is *not* required. You are more than welcome to
        just register at the door, with no penalty. However, if you are planning
        on competing, we would much appreciate it if you did register in advance
        so that we know what to expect. 2. We initially decided to keep the
        number of events somewhat small, since we have a hard deadline by when
        we need to leave the venue. However, if we somehow get ahead of
        schedule, there is a possibility that we will add an event or two or an
        extra round to a popular event. Just wanted everyone to keep that in
        mind. If you guys have any questions about the competition (hotel,
        airports, rules, etc.), I strongly urge you to ask. If you want to
        contact me directly, my email address is: *sapan.upadhyay@...* . Hope to
        see you guys at the competition! -Sapan Upadhyay [Non-text portions of

        Like the 3x3, once I learn how to solve it slowly (L by L), I want to
        learn to get faster (lubricting, different methods, etc.) I went to the
        Rubik&#x27;s online store and found that they give a warning about
        turning their 4x4 fast because it could break (&quot;due to considerably
        more moving parts&quot;). The Eastsheen that I was looking at (Eastsheen
        C4) does not give that kind of warning. The box also includes a DIY
        Guide (assembly - the cube comes assembled, but if you want to
        disassemble, you can). I was wondering which of these was the better
        cube to buy. I would be looking for the one that turns well (with or
        without lubrication) and doesn&#x27;t crumble (I saw a Youtube video
        where the guy&#x27;s cube crumbled when he tried to scramble it
        quickly). Also, this is not a matter of cost, the two are within a few
        cents of each other from where I would be ordering it from. Does anyone
        have any input?

        There&#x27;s a third option you may want to look into - Meffert&#x27;s.
        Check out this thread -
        http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?t=11159 - comparing
        Meffert&#x27;s and Eastsheen. I have a Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4 and it&#x27;s
        kind of sucky. Other cubers who have tried it at competitions agree.
        Most cubers I talk to recommend I get a Meffert&#x27;s. Though I only
        have Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4s, based on what I&#x27;ve heard and read,
        I&#x27;d go for a Meffert&#x27;s. -ant On Thu, Aug 6, 2009 at 10:53 AM,

        Hey, I was just wondering what people do at the end of reduction when
        they have one edge group left with the OLL parity. Do you do the 15-move
        OLL parity alg then (and then risk the possibility of having to do it
        again later) or do you start the the 3x3 solve with the parity still in
        place and then fix the parity once later? If you wait to fix the parity,
        the flipped piece could get really annoying if it happens to be part of
        your cross or 2x2x2 block. Just curious how other people deal with this
        scenario. -ant

        I am not a speedsolver -- but based on my experiences solving the 6x6x6
        I would suggest leaving the parity until later, and get accustomed to
        recognizing the odd piece by its outer (or inner if you prefer) pair of
        edges. For example, if you&#x27;re doing the Fridrich 7-look method [1],
        when doing each of the 4 corner+edge steps [2], you might focus on the
        four LL corners and their adjacent edge pieces (ignoring the central two
        slices everywhere) to select your F2L algs. It&#x27;s going to depend a
        lot on how your brain recognizes patterns, because you&#x27;re going to
        have to learn to do it without thinking. I suspect many will find it
        easy and others will find it much more difficult. [1]:

        I am not fast either, but I confine the parity to one edge group, then
        fix it once F2L is done so I can see which way to flip the pieces.
        Ideally, as I solve the edges, I try to arrange having the final edge
        group (with possible parity) contain U colors. But it is not so
        important, because I can use the slower &quot;slice&quot; version of
        15-move OLL parity algorithm so only the cubies in that edge group get
        affected. (By the way, I do the PLL parity separately because I never
        bothered to learn the OLL+PLL algorithm.) --- In

      <strong>214. Which is the best 3 X 3 Cube to purchase?</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Okay...not necessarily the very best, but what cube can I purchase for
        about $30 to $40? A friend bought me a cube that cost about $30 that I
        am quite happy with, but my dog chewed on it. My friend does not
        remember which website she purchased it from, and I do not have the
        original packaging. Is there a way to identify the cube I have by some
        other means? The cube was advertised as a speed cube and it is slightly
        heavier and feels much sturdier than some of the $10 cubes I have
        bought. The stickers are thicker than on the cheap cubes and they only
        have one layer. One of the cheap cubes I have has thin orange and yellow
        stickers glued onto a white base sticker. I can pop the cube apart
        fairly easily, but is has very rarely popped apart while I am solving
        it. The lubricant appears to be graphite. So, I am looking to (1)
        identify this cube and purchase an identical cube; or (2) buy an
        equivalent or high quality cube (say, &lt; $40); or (3) repair my
        existing cube by replacing the 3 stickers my dog chewed off, and
        lubricating the cube. Thanks for anyone who can help me!

        Hi Roux solvers, i&#x27;ve modified the idea of &quot;2.5 look last six
        edges&quot; from josef jelinek and found a really good strategy for
        orient and permute the last six edges in 2 Steps. There are only 11 new
        algs to learn (for the orientation). You will reach a lower move count
        because opposite-colour-neutrality. I&#x27;ve set it on my site
        :www.speedcubing.ch (3x3 roux-stadler solution) Its written in german,
        but i think that you will understand the pictures. Thx for comments and
        more ideas. Thomas Stadler (Switzerland) P.S. See you in Düsseldorf (WM)

        Hi Anthony, I just got 2 megaminxes from cube4you.com. One is a QJ PVC
        stickered megaminx that cost $6.99, and should NEVER be considered for
        speedsolving. The other is a MF8 tiled Megaminx II for $14.99, that
        spins like a dream. Unlike some of the other Chinese sites, cube4you
        ships UPS, which means lower shipping costs and faster delivery. I paid
        around $20 for shipping, and received my order (from China to Florida,
        US) in 5 days. Hope this helps and good luck! Abby On Wed, Oct 7, 2009

        In case there are still people who only use this forum: Announcing the
        Negative Time Solving Contest 2009 It&#x27;s that time of the year
        again! This is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative
        time as day light saving (DST) ends and time falls back one hour. DST
        (Daylight Saving Time) ends at 3am on Sunday, October 25 in many
        European countries. In most parts of the United States and Canada, DST
        ends at 2am on Sunday, November 1. See Time and Date.com to check the
        clock change schedule in your area. Results from Europe will NOT be
        posted until the results from North America come in a week later. This
        year&#x27;s scrambles have already been posted on
        [URL=&quot;http://cubefreak.net/negative.html&quot;]the official contest
        page[/URL], which also has links to submission forms and past results.
        Please note that each solve started (not just start the timer but
        actually make a move) before daylight saving ends and completed after it
        ends counts as a negative solve. This means that you can compete in
        multiple categories at the cost of a less negative time. Good luck to
        everyone! Best, -macky

        Hey folks, I&#x27;m just getting back into cubing a little bit... have
        done it on and off for years, but haven&#x27;t done it for a long time.
        I use fridrich with 3LLL. My F2L has gotten pretty slow and I know I can
        decrease it from 24 seconds-ish to around 18 with a week of practice or
        so. I have two questions 1) Regarding speeding up F2L: when you look
        ahead, are you able to identify all the possible pairs, and find which
        one will be fastest? Or is it more important to find ANY pair such that
        the time between pairs is eliminated? 2) Are there any new techniques I
        should learn? I&#x27;m fascianted by partial edge control... looks fun.
        Is it worth it? Thanks! David

        1) Personally, I look for any pairs. Unless your brain can work that
        fast, it wouldn&#x27;t be really efficient to look for the best pair,
        unless you actually notice it. I sometimes have that moment.

        tips needed Hey folks, I&#x27;m just getting back into cubing a little
        bit... have done it on and off for years, but haven&#x27;t done it for a
        long time. I use fridrich with 3LLL. My F2L has gotten pretty slow and I
        know I can decrease it from 24 seconds-ish to around 18 with a week of
        practice or so. I have two questions 1) Regarding speeding up F2L: when
        you look ahead, are you able to identify all the possible pairs, and
        find which one will be fastest? Or is it more important to find ANY pair
        such that the time between pairs is eliminated? 2) Are there any new
        techniques I should learn? I&#x27;m fascianted by partial edge
        control... looks fun. Is it worth it? Thanks! David

        totally up to you. depending on which method you&#x27;re planning to
        learn blindfold cubing (I suggest this method:

        it&#x27;s better to finish Fridrich before going on to blindfold, which

        hi athefre, thx for the link, now i&#x27;see that this idea already
        exists :-( so what are your experiences using 2,5 look last six edges
        for speedcubing (not for fmc)? are you place the UL and UR at the bottom
        before doing CMLL (so its necessary to use COLL) ? Have you seen that
        you can also using UF and UB at the buffer position ? Has someone
        written all algs if i would placing DF and DB at DF and DB (ignoring
        exact position and orientation) and then orient all 6 remaining edges?
        It would end up with an EO at last. What would be the fastest way? My
        average using 2,5 look last six edges is around 18seconds (but i think
        that i could speed up if i could place UR and UL before C...LL and if i
        have learned all last step cases)... thx for new (or already existing)
        ideas Thomas Stadler www.speedcubing.ch

        The main problem I see with this 2.5 look is the time it takes to look
        for UL and UR so you can place them at DF and DB. With Gilles
        Roux&#x27;s LSE, it takes almost no time at all to see the orientation
        pattern. It takes a little more time to find two edges than it does to
        recognize an orientation pattern. Plus both have about the same move
        count so I don&#x27;t see any benefit to using this 2.5 look style other
        than to be doing something different. One thing I do think though is,
        after CMLL, if UL/UR happen to already be at DF and DB, that you could
        use this new 2.5 look depending on the case. I think it would give you a
        lower move count without losing time to recognition. > are you place the
        UL and UR at the bottom before doing CMLL (so its > necessary to use
        COLL) ? I haven&#x27;t ever considered this. I thought about doing it
        with Petrus though. What&#x27;s your way of doing it? Do you place each
        edge while doing the second block&#x27;s pairs? > Have you seen that you
        can also using UF and UB at the buffer position ? You mean solving UF
        and UB instead of UL and UR? I&#x27;ve tried that a few times and I
        found it a little hard to see which way to have the corners so I could
        finish M. > Has someone written all algs if i would placing DF and DB at

        I guess it would be as good as the other way of doing the LSE.
        Recognition time may be a problem. When using &quot;Roux&quot; I solve
        the regular way; block, block, corners, normal LSE. When I was using
        NMCMLL, I was using unconstrained centers in LSE and it felt so
        unnecessary. The recognition time was a little longer than the regular
        way and it had a higher move count average (by .75) because of the final
        R/r rotation. Honestly, the best way I&#x27;ve seen to finish the last
        six edges in &quot;Roux&quot; is the way Gilles Roux describes on his
        site. In my opinion it is already a 2.5 look because you first look at
        the edge orientation, and while you are doing that you notice the
        location of the UL/UR edges, you solve one or both of them at the same
        time you are orienting, then you permute the M edges. It&#x27;s
        wonderful. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,
