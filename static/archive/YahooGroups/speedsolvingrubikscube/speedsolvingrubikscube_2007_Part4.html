        Hi, Yes this is also how I would approach it, pretty much the same as
        Tim. I the T OLL and the P OLL (the two 6 move cases) to orient edges.
        Then for corners I show them R' D2 R F D2 F' and F D2 F' R' D2 R to
        orient one at a time. For sune cases they need to orient one corner
        twice in the opposite direction. For permuting corners I use commutators
        like R' D2 R U R' D2 R U R' D2 R U2 R' D2 R but I call it using the
        "storage spot". First they see that the UFR corner is in the incorrect
        location (say you have the three cycle UFR-&gt;UBR-&gt;UBL). I tell them
        to take it out of the U layer and "put it into the storage spot" which
        is the location DBL. They do this with R' D2 R. Then I tell them to find
        the spot where it needs to go, here UBR, and turn the U layer so that it
        is at UFR (which I call the working location). Rinse and Repeat. For
        edges same thing it's just that the "storage spot" is DF after you apply
        M D2 M' and they continue the same. I have also tried to show a little
        more standard stuff for last layer and I usually end up confusing
        people. But everyone who I've shown using commutators seems to get it,
        and when they come back later on they can still remember what to do -
        they don't forget the moves because they aren't really algorithms to
        them. Hope this helps. I've taught several high school level kids and a
        couple middle school level kids how to solve using this method. I did
        teach one 4th grader too, and I'm currently in the process of teaching
        about 3 more kids as well. I always use this approach when I teach now,
        because I think it lets people understand what they are doing as they
        solve. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Timothy

        It just seems to my naive view that learning to do a certain algorithm
        over and over is maybe useful for getting faster with the hands.
        However, you can't possibly be directing a movie, you might, but for god
        sakes, in the video, you don't look more than 17 years old.
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=8v6uJOxquXs
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=aOiKEg3RapY You could be directing a movie,
        but I just doubt it. Also, whne you were solving, you were doing it
        layer by layer, which is something most experienced cubers don't (on the
        non blindfolded). BY logical thought, you have to be a semi-advanced
        cuber to learn to do BLD. (Consider this from a naive point of view).
        And also, you could find any of the great cuber's sites and just learn
        one thing on the OLL and PLL. (like what Shelley said) P.S. Pancakes are

        Ah, I see what Chris means. While "The Puzzle" was pretty funny, that
        blindfold video, well, it doesn't do any favors for the credibility of

        faster with the hands. However, you &gt; &gt; can't possibly be
        directing a movie, you might, but for god sakes, &gt; in the &gt; &gt;
        video, you don't look more than 17 years old. &gt; &gt;

        http://youtube.com/watch?v=aOiKEg3RapY &gt; &gt; You could be directing
        a movie, but I just doubt it. Also, whne you were &gt; &gt; solving, you
        were doing it layer by layer, which is something most &gt; &gt;
        experienced cubers don't (on the non blindfolded). BY logical &gt;
        thought, you &gt; &gt; have to be a semi-advanced cuber to learn to do
        BLD. (Consider this &gt; from a &gt; &gt; naive point of view). And
        also, you could find any of the great cuber's &gt; &gt; sites and just
        learn one thing on the OLL and PLL. (like what &gt; Shelley said) &gt;

        blindfolded solving was possible! So, I'm sorry if you were offended by

        I'm pretty sure I've exceeded my Rubik's Cube video quota :P This next
        video that I'm doing is for YouTube and for my professional reel. I'm
        getting a crew together (friends I've met at work and school) and we're
        making a 5 minute short film with decent lighting, camera work, etc
        about a social pariah who leaves home for the first time to go to

        my other online videos. I wanted to do a one-take shot of someone
        handing him the cube, which looks really scrambled, and he solves it in
        a really short amount of time. We did some test shots... the speeding up
        doesn't look real enough, a cut defeats the purpose of the shot (ala the
        pursuit of happyness), and the cube looks too solved with the last layer
        algorithms. I might teach him one of the more complicated PLLs or
        something like: R U R' U' even though that doesn't mess with some of the
        sides. To the people who asked, I'm 20 years old and have a full time

        I'm interested in putting up a Norwegian Open or similar soon myself,
        and this delegate thing has got me puzzled. It would be very
        inconvenient if the delegates had to be chosen from a very small set,
        what with the current plethora of events. In addition, it says on the
        WCA site that the delegate to past events like WCs were people who also
        competed. So from the wording in the regulations it seems like the WCA
        delegate may, in fact, be yourself. Eivind --- In

        Setting it up so that he just does one thing over and over to solve the
        cube will look just as fake, and it fuels the misguided notion some
        people have that cubing is just knowing "the algorithm" that you do over
        and over until the cube is solved. I suggest you use stunt hands and do
        a real solve. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi! I`m not a really experienced cuber (well, five months), but i
        started out using this method. I think it`s pretty simple.

        Hi, Yes this is also how I would approach it, pretty much the same as
        Tim. I the T OLL and the P OLL (the two 6 move cases) to orient edges.
        Then for corners I show them R' D2 R F D2 F' and F D2 F' R' D2 R to
        orient one at a time. For sune cases they need to orient one corner
        twice in the opposite direction. For permuting corners I use commutators
        like R' D2 R U R' D2 R U R' D2 R U2 R' D2 R but I call it using the
        "storage spot". First they see that the UFR corner is in the incorrect
        location (say you have the three cycle UFR-&gt;UBR-&gt;UBL) . I tell
        them to take it out of the U layer and "put it into the storage spot"
        which is the location DBL. They do this with R' D2 R. Then I tell them
        to find the spot where it needs to go, here UBR, and turn the U layer so
        that it is at UFR (which I call the working location). Rinse and Repeat.
        For edges same thing it's just that the "storage spot" is DF after you
        apply M D2 M' and they continue the same. I have also tried to show a
        little more standard stuff for last layer and I usually end up confusing
        people. But everyone who I've shown using commutators seems to get it,
        and when they come back later on they can still remember what to do -
        they don't forget the moves because they aren't really algorithms to
        them. Hope this helps. I've taught several high school level kids and a
        couple middle school level kids how to solve using this method. I did
        teach one 4th grader too, and I'm currently in the process of teaching
        about 3 more kids as well. I always use this approach when I teach now,
        because I think it lets people understand what they are doing as they
        solve. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubiksc ube@yahoogroups. com, "Timothy

        Gondry "foot-solve" cube video (my favorite director). &gt; &gt;
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=E-eZEDkFYFA &gt; &gt; Back then, I didn't
        even know blindfolded solving was possible! So, &gt; &gt; I'm sorry if
        you were offended by it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that video, I had the
        cube lying around, so I decided to learn &gt; &gt; how to solve it
        (after I did, I made my second cube video "The Puzzle"). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I'm pretty sure I've exceeded my Rubik's Cube video quota :P &gt;
        &gt; This next video that I'm doing is for YouTube and for my
        professional &gt; &gt; reel. I'm getting a crew together (friends I've
        met at work and &gt; &gt; school) and we're making a 5 minute short film
        with decent lighting, &gt; &gt; camera work, etc about a social pariah
        who leaves home for the first &gt; &gt; time to go to college. I figured
        I'd throw in a Rubik's cube scene as &gt; &gt; a reference to my other
        online videos. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to do a one-take shot of
        someone handing him the cube, which &gt; &gt; looks really scrambled,
        and he solves it in a really short amount of &gt; &gt; time. We did some
        test shots... the speeding up doesn't look real &gt; &gt; enough, a cut
        defeats the purpose of the shot (ala the pursuit of &gt; &gt;
        happyness), and the cube looks too solved with the last layer &gt;
        algorithms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I might teach him one of the more
        complicated PLLs or something like: &gt; &gt; R U R' U' &gt; &gt; even
        though that doesn't mess with some of the sides. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; To the people who asked, &gt; &gt; I'm 20 years old and have a
        full time job as a video editor. &gt; &gt; I'm shooting this in the
        Boston area, so (to the ones who offered) I'd &gt; &gt; be more than
        willing to get some help :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for

        each position, and the corresponding element of a list is incremented in

        compute the result for all last layer positions. Type: llorder(0); in

        difficult to organize a competition here in India because not many of us
        have actually been to any other actual competitions.But hey!There are
        people like Bernett and John Louis.We can take suggestions from them and
        try and make it as good as possible. I know it will be difficult to get
        a WCA official from the US or Europe.But if is possible then it is well
        and good.Also can someone like John Louis act as a WCA official? Anyway
        we will at least try have it unofficially to try and popularize the cube
        here in India. Me, Sachin and a few other cubers from IITM and may be
        also IITB will be there. Cheers Karthik

        slightly over 2000 competitors, including five who solved the 3x3

        &gt; &gt; I am working very hard at finding a loctaion still to have a
        &gt; &gt; competition on the East coast in Virginia. Things are looking
        good &gt; &gt; for a room at a Best Western. I need my brother to check
        out the &gt; room &gt; &gt; before I agree to it. If this is the
        location then things will work &gt; &gt; out just fine. The room holds
        about 50-55 people hopefully this is &gt; &gt; big enough for our
        competition. If this is the room that I am &gt; getting &gt; &gt; it
        will be about $300 for the room so there will be a charge for &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; competition. Hope to see some of you there. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I guess what he means is R U' R' U, with cross on the right. The problem
        corner is in UFL. Do the above until the UFL corner happens to be
        correct, then rotate L so that a new problem corner is in UFL. Repatedly
        apply the above until that too is oriented, etc. F2L will be restored

        Well, I average a little higher on the 2x2x2 than the 3x3x3 right now :

        Hi, I made this small, simple 3x3 rubiks simulator. This is not feature
        rich, but hope it can be useful somehow. note: 1. To rotate whole cube x
        &amp; y axis: click left mouse on black background and drag it. 2. To
        rotate whole cube z axis: click right mouse anywhere and drag it. 3. To
        rotate part of cube: click any section, drag to next section and release
        it. (there will be an arrow showing part and direction of the rotation).
        enjoy, Regards, Cedi

        In keeping with what has now become a tradition (despite the
        unpopularity of this whole idea in some quarters), I'm once again
        organizing the yearly Negative Time Solving Contest. The official page
        is at http://cubefreak.net/negative.html , where the scrambles for this
        year have already been posted. DST ends in the United States and in
        Canada this year at 2am on November 4 (Sunday), one week after EU
        summertime ends at 1am UT on October 28 (Sunday). I will NOT post the
        results from Europe until the results from North America come in a week
        later. A slight note in response to Lucas Garron's solves from last
        year: Please note that each solve started (not just start the timer but
        actually make a move) before daylight saving ends and completed after it
        ends counts as a negative solve. This means that you can simultaneously
        compete in 3x3 speedsolve, 3x3 blindfolded, and whatever else your heart
        desires, at the cost of some extra time in your negative solve. I think
        a fun category would be "most cubes solved blindfolded in a negative
        time." the whole thing needs to be done in an hour, so you first have to
        decide on the number of cubers to attempt, and then, taking into account
        your average memorization time for that number of cubes, start
        memorizing at some appropriate time before daylight saving ends. You can
        find instructions for sending in your times on the link above. Once
        again, thanks to Tyson for bringing this great Caltech tradition to
        cubing. Good luck to everyone! Enjoy, Macky

        I also found Parker Gaitley quite quickly. I don't know if I did it
        differently to Joel or not. Just click on all persons for 2x2, then
        clicked on people with an avg of above 30s, until I saw one with a sub20
        avg for 3x3! Not efficient, but I think it is the only way! Thanks, Joey

        Solving Contest. The official page &gt; &gt; is at
        http://cubefreak.net/negative.html , &gt; &gt; where the scrambles for
        this year have already been posted. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DST ends in the
        United States and in Canada this year at 2am on &gt; &gt; November 4
        (Sunday), one week after EU summertime ends at 1am UT on &gt; &gt;
        October 28 (Sunday). I will NOT post the results from Europe until the
        &gt; &gt; results from North America come in a week later. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; A slight note in response to Lucas Garron's solves from last
        year: &gt; &gt; Please note that each solve started (not just start the
        timer but &gt; &gt; actually make a move) before daylight saving ends
        and completed after &gt; &gt; it ends counts as a negative solve. This
        means that you can &gt; &gt; simultaneously compete in 3x3 speedsolve,
        3x3 blindfolded, and &gt; &gt; whatever else your heart desires, at the
        cost of some extra time in &gt; &gt; your negative solve. I think a fun
        category would be "most cubes &gt; &gt; solved blindfolded in a negative
        time." the whole thing needs to be &gt; &gt; done in an hour, so you
        first have to decide on the number of cubers &gt; &gt; to attempt, and
        then, taking into account your average memorization &gt; &gt; time for
        that number of cubes, start memorizing at some appropriate &gt; &gt;
        time before daylight saving ends. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can find
        instructions for sending in your times on the link above. &gt; &gt; Once
        again, thanks to Tyson for bringing this great Caltech tradition &gt;
        &gt; to cubing. Good luck to everyone! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoy, &gt;

        Generally we like to do a weekend in the summer. It's more convenient
        for everyone, I think... especially the students and a large percentage
        of the cubing demographic is between the ages of 14 and 20. When exactly
        during the summer, I'm not sure. Of course, if we got a good deal some
        other time, like a weekend in some other random month, that might be too
        much to resist. Our idea at this point is the shot gun approach. After
        we have our proposal written, we're going to fire it everywhere. Las
        Vegas casinos, science museums, Chicago again, etc... So if you have an
        idea of a possible venue, let us know. The Dallas competition at The
        Science Place was a result of a one-line e-mail from Shelley. -Tyson On

        I did not stay at the Congress Plaza hotel, mainly due to finding a
        cheaper hotel about 20 minutes outside the city, with more

        Do keep in mind that a competition venue far away from California can be
        very difficult for us. An operation in Los Angeles would be almost
        trivial for us to run. There is a significant burden when we travel far
        away, and there is a very large cost as well. No matter where you hold a
        competition, some people will have to travel. With that being said, if
        you could give us suitable examples of places we could look into, that's
        the only way any work is going to get done. Time is always limited for
        me, so please suggest theme parks or museums and don't make me go
        searching for these things myself. Chicago was a lot of fun, but it did
        cost the club about $7,000 to run that competition. We would be willing
        to travel to organize a competition if there is a good venue. -Tyson On

        Hi there, Someone was asking me about supercubes (actually, they asked
        about "solving cubes with pictures on them"). I was looking for a good
        webpage to send them, but didn't really find anything when googling. I'm
        really just after some basic information and instructions. If anyone has
        a webpage about supercube solving, can you post the link? Thanks,

        (I assume you solve on the D face here) make sure the edges line up
        correctly with the D face center. Solve 3 cross edges this way. Before
        inserting the last cross edge use the "empty" cross slot to correctly
        rotate the E layer centers that are touching your 3 already solved cross
        pieces. Then make sure to insert the 4th cross piece such that it is
        correctly lined up with it's center. When solving F2L try to not use F2L
        tricks that would flip an E layer center. After you have done OLL and
        PLL, you often have to correct the U center, and also some OLL and PLL
        algs will flip 1 E layer center. So you may need to fix 2 centers. Use
        the algs from the beginner method for this. You should only need to use
        1 alg to fix centers at this point, unless you use crazy OLL and PLL
        algs ;-) Some algs may rotate the D center, so you may need to use one
        of the U and D center flippers. Advanced 3x3x3 method:
        ---------------------- I never learned this method, but hey it never
        hurts to come up with theory for it anyway ;-) For this method you
        directly solve the cross and the D and all 4 E layer centers. I did work
        on this quite a bit, but now I am out of practice for it. It is possible
        to do this each time with practice, but it takes a LOT of practice. Use
        supercube safe OLL and PLL algs. Also learn additional alg sets to solve
        the PLL case *and* correctly rotate the U center. Again I never learned
        this method, but I did work on the first part about direct solving the
        cross and the first 5 centers. Supercube 4x4x4 and 5x5x5:
        -------------------------- I assume you are solving with the reduction
        method i.e. solve the centers, then the edge groups, then solve as a
        3x3x3. You can pair up the first 4 centers exactly like you would with
        your normal method. Just be sure to be placing them together such that
        you are solving the centers in the supercube sense. No new algs are
        required for this, just go slow and think carefully. For the 5th center
        you can also do this intuitively but it typically is a bit harder than
        the 5th center on a regular 4x4 or 5x5. I would recommend the use of
        commutators for placing the last 1 or 2 centers for almost all cases.
        However you can still solve this center without the use of commutators,
        rather with just careful thought and good technique. For the 6th center
        you will need algs like these below. If you understand commutators just
        skip the section below and use your favorite commutators to solve the
        last center, that's all these algs are. ******* ALL algs below assume
        you have not solved the edge groups yet. I would recommend to fix the
        6th center before fixing edges. ******* 4x4x4 algs: ----------- Swap Ufl
        and Ufr: (Rr)' F (Rr)' (Bb)2 (Rr) F' (Rr)' (Bb)2 (Rr)2 Swap Ufl with Ufr
        *and* Ubl with Ubr: (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)' (Ll)' (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) U2
        (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)' (Ll)' (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) 5x5x5 algs: (note that
        lower case m,e,s moves denote only the innermost slice, not the triple
        inner layer): ------------- The first thing you need to look at is to
        see if you have a 4 cycle or a 2 cycle of the "+" centers. The four
        center pieces together with the centralmost piece on a face that look
        like a "+" sign are the ones I am referring to. If you do have a 4 cycle
        or a 2 cycle of these pieces, this means you have parity in the wings.
        Use your standard parity alg that you would normally use for fixing the
        last edge group, only you *must* execute this alg with the 6th and
        unsolved center on the U face. This will fix the parity in the "+"
        centers. As an example I use the alg (Rr) U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)' U2
        (Ll) U2 (Rr)2 Now you may need to use one of the following cycles to fix
        the "+" centers now that you have correct parity. Rotate your cube or
        simply spin the U layer until you have one of the cases I describe "+"
        center algs --------------- Three-cycles: Cycle Usl-&gt;Umf-&gt;Usr
        (counter-clockwise): (Ff)' r' e r U2 r' e' r U2 (Ff) Cycle
        Usl-&gt;Usr-&gt;Umf (clockwise): (Ff)' U2 r' e r U2 r' e' r (Ff) "Z"
        perm -------- Swap Umf with Usr and Umb with Usl: m s (Dd) s' (Dd)2 m'
        U2 m (Dd)2 s (Dd)' s' m' "H" perm -------- (Rr) (Ll) U2 (Ll)' (Rr)' U'
        (Rr) (Ll) U2 (Ll)' (Rr)' "X" center algs: ---------------- Now that the
        "+" centers are done we have to finish the X centers. Rotate your cube
        until you can use one of the following algs: 3 cycles:
        Ufr-&gt;Ubr-&gt;Ubl (counter-clockwise): (Ff)' r' u' r U r' u r U' (Ff)
        Ufr-&gt;Ubl-&gt;Ubr (clockwise): (Ff)' U r' u' r U' r' u r (Ff) "E" Perm
        -------- Swap Ufr with Ubr and Ufl with Ubl (Rr)' (Dd)' L' u' R (Dd)'
        (Rr) U2 (Rr)' (Dd) R' u L (Dd) (Rr) "H" Perm -------- (Rr)' (Ll)' (Dd)2
        (Rr) (Ll) U (Rr)' (Ll)' (Dd)2 (Rr) (Ll)

        extensively. Perhaps a link to this thread would be &gt; enough? &gt;
        &gt; Supercube 3x3x3: &gt; ---------------- &gt; &gt; Easy/Beginner
        method: just solve as normal and use the following algs &gt; to flip
        centers after you are done with the corners and edges. &gt; &gt; Rotate
        U clockwise and R counter-clockwise: &gt; U M E' M' U' M E M' &gt; &gt;
        Rotate U counter-clockwise and R clockwise: &gt; U' M E' M' U M E M'
        &gt; &gt; Rotate U twice and R twice: &gt; U2 M E' M' U2 M E M' &gt;
        &gt; Rotate U twice: &gt; R L U2 R' L' U' R L U2 R' L' U' &gt; &gt;
        Rotate U clockwise and R clockwise: &gt; R L U2 R' L' U' M E' M' E R L
        U2 R' L' U' E' M E M' &gt; &gt; Rotate U counter-clockwise and R
        counter-clockwise: &gt; R L U2 R' L' U M E' M' E R L U2 R' L' U E' M E
        M' &gt; &gt; Rotate U clockwise and D counter-clockwise: &gt; U M E2 M'
        U' M E2 M' &gt; &gt; Rotate U counter-clockwise and D clockwise: &gt; U'
        M E2 M' U M E2 M' &gt; &gt; Rotate U twice and D twice: &gt; U2 M E2 M'
        U2 M E2 M' &gt; &gt; Rotate U clockwise and D clockwise: &gt; R L U2 L'
        R' U' M E2 M' E2 R L U2 R' L' U' M E2 M' E2 &gt; &gt; Rotate U
        counter-clockwise and D counter-clockwise: &gt; R L U2 L' R' U M E2 M'
        E2 R L U2 R' L' U M E2 M' E2 &gt; &gt; Intermediate 3x3 method: &gt;
        ------------------------ &gt; &gt; When solving the cross (I assume you
        solve on the D face here) make &gt; sure the edges line up correctly
        with the D face center. Solve 3 &gt; cross edges this way. Before
        inserting the last cross edge use the &gt; "empty" cross slot to
        correctly rotate the E layer centers that are &gt; touching your 3
        already solved cross pieces. Then make sure to insert &gt; the 4th cross
        piece such that it is correctly lined up with it's &gt; center. When
        solving F2L try to not use F2L tricks that would flip an &gt; E layer
        center. After you have done OLL and PLL, you often have to &gt; correct
        the U center, and also some OLL and PLL algs will flip 1 E &gt; layer
        center. So you may need to fix 2 centers. Use the algs from &gt; the
        beginner method for this. You should only need to use 1 alg to &gt; fix
        centers at this point, unless you use crazy OLL and PLL algs ;-) &gt;
        Some algs may rotate the D center, so you may need to use one of the U
        &gt; and D center flippers. &gt; &gt; Advanced 3x3x3 method: &gt;
        ---------------------- &gt; &gt; I never learned this method, but hey it
        never hurts to come up with &gt; theory for it anyway ;-) &gt; &gt; For
        this method you directly solve the cross and the D and all 4 E &gt;
        layer centers. I did work on this quite a bit, but now I am out of &gt;
        practice for it. It is possible to do this each time with practice, &gt;
        but it takes a LOT of practice. &gt; &gt; Use supercube safe OLL and PLL
        algs. Also learn additional alg sets &gt; to solve the PLL case *and*
        correctly rotate the U center. &gt; &gt; Again I never learned this
        method, but I did work on the first part &gt; about direct solving the
        cross and the first 5 centers. &gt; &gt; Supercube 4x4x4 and 5x5x5: &gt;
        -------------------------- &gt; &gt; I assume you are solving with the
        reduction method i.e. solve the &gt; centers, then the edge groups, then
        solve as a 3x3x3. You can pair up &gt; the first 4 centers exactly like
        you would with your normal method. &gt; Just be sure to be placing them
        together such that you are solving the &gt; centers in the supercube
        sense. No new algs are required for this, &gt; just go slow and think
        carefully. For the 5th center you can also do &gt; this intuitively but
        it typically is a bit harder than the 5th center &gt; on a regular 4x4
        or 5x5. I would recommend the use of commutators for &gt; placing the
        last 1 or 2 centers for almost all cases. However you can &gt; still
        solve this center without the use of commutators, rather with &gt; just
        careful thought and good technique. &gt; &gt; For the 6th center you
        will need algs like these below. If you &gt; understand commutators just
        skip the section below and use your &gt; favorite commutators to solve
        the last center, that's all these algs are. &gt; &gt; ******* &gt; ALL
        algs below assume you have not solved the edge groups yet. I &gt; would
        recommend to fix the 6th center before fixing edges. &gt; ******* &gt;
        &gt; 4x4x4 algs: &gt; ----------- &gt; Swap Ufl and Ufr: (Rr)' F (Rr)'
        (Bb)2 (Rr) F' (Rr)' (Bb)2 (Rr)2 &gt; Swap Ufl with Ufr *and* Ubl with
        Ubr: (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)' (Ll)' &gt; (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) U2 (Rr)' (Dd)
        (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)' (Ll)' (Rr)' (Dd) (Rr) &gt; &gt; 5x5x5 algs: (note that
        lower case m,e,s moves denote only the &gt; innermost slice, not the
        triple inner layer): &gt; ------------- &gt; &gt; The first thing you
        need to look at is to see if you have a 4 cycle or &gt; a 2 cycle of the
        "+" centers. The four center pieces together with &gt; the centralmost
        piece on a face that look like a "+" sign are the ones &gt; I am
        referring to. &gt; &gt; If you do have a 4 cycle or a 2 cycle of these
        pieces, this means you &gt; have parity in the wings. Use your standard
        parity alg that you would &gt; normally use for fixing the last edge
        group, only you *must* execute &gt; this alg with the 6th and unsolved
        center on the U face. This will &gt; fix the parity in the "+" centers.
        As an example I use the alg (Rr) &gt; U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)' U2
        (Ll) U2 (Rr)2 &gt; &gt; Now you may need to use one of the following
        cycles to fix the "+" &gt; centers now that you have correct parity.
        Rotate your cube or simply &gt; spin the U layer until you have one of
        the cases I describe &gt; &gt; "+" center algs &gt; --------------- &gt;
        Three-cycles: &gt; Cycle Usl-&gt;Umf-&gt;Usr (counter-clockwise): (Ff)'
        r' e r U2 r' e' r U2 (Ff) &gt; &gt; Cycle Usl-&gt;Usr-&gt;Umf
        (clockwise): (Ff)' U2 r' e r U2 r' e' r (Ff) &gt; &gt; "Z" perm &gt;
        -------- &gt; Swap Umf with Usr and Umb with Usl: m s (Dd) s' (Dd)2 m'
        U2 m (Dd)2 s &gt; (Dd)' s' m' &gt; &gt; "H" perm &gt; -------- &gt; (Rr)
        (Ll) U2 (Ll)' (Rr)' U' (Rr) (Ll) U2 (Ll)' (Rr)' &gt; &gt; "X" center
        algs: &gt; ---------------- &gt; Now that the "+" centers are done we
        have to finish the X centers. &gt; Rotate your cube until you can use
        one of the following algs: &gt; &gt; 3 cycles: &gt; Ufr-&gt;Ubr-&gt;Ubl
        (counter-clockwise): (Ff)' r' u' r U r' u r U' (Ff) &gt;
        Ufr-&gt;Ubl-&gt;Ubr (clockwise): (Ff)' U r' u' r U' r' u r (Ff) &gt;
        &gt; "E" Perm &gt; -------- &gt; Swap Ufr with Ubr and Ufl with Ubl &gt;
        (Rr)' (Dd)' L' u' R (Dd)' (Rr) U2 (Rr)' (Dd) R' u L (Dd) (Rr) &gt; &gt;
        "H" Perm &gt; -------- &gt; (Rr)' (Ll)' (Dd)2 (Rr) (Ll) U (Rr)' (Ll)'
        (Dd)2 (Rr) (Ll) &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------- &gt;

        Hello, I've been thinking about writing a small solver for the 3x3 in
        PHP. I have *very little* experience in programming however, so I was
        wondering if any of you can give me advice... What would be a clever
        algorithm for this? I want it to be reasonable fast, but also very easy
        to program. Efficiency is not very important, so I could just write a
        very lazy algorithm based on 2 cycles (like Pochmann); easy to program,
        but it would result in way too many moves (quite possibly 200+). Maybe
        50 move solution would be better... Ideas or suggestions, anyone? -

        Any cycle-based solution should be easy to program. You might need to
        bend your brain a little to figure out the setup moves though. In
        Pochmann, or M2, setup moves are straightforward - you can just tabulate
        them. In a pure-cycle BLD method this becomes harder. I was going to say
        that PHP is not the way to go here, but since you're not writing an
        optimal solver, I guess it's ok. If you were, you'd have to take into
        account that most servers timeout their PHP scripts after 30 seconds or
        so. Dunno how much programming "very little" is, so here's more :) I'd
        figure out some clever data structure to store cube positions in. Then
        I'd keep a bunch of algs, with or without setup moves (depending on
        solution method maybe - you be the judge) that can act on the cube (say,
        make an alg class and then make instances for each alg you need, load
        the notation in a constructor). Then, the solution code should (i.e. for
        M2) look at the edge in DF, load the corresponding alg object, ask the
        alg to output the notation into a buffer, and then make the alg act on
        the cube. Loop. Of course you need to take other cases in account (is
        edge in DF solved? then break into a new cycle if there is one, or go on
        to corners if the edges are all ok.) Hope that made sense. Eivind --- In

        I stayed at the Congress. One thing I wonder about Los Angeles, would it
        be almost too convient? For example, in one of the Caltech tournaments,
        you had over 100 competitors for the 3x3x3, and it seems like not many
        competed in other events (really there weren't that many other events).
        It would seem like you would have to limit either the number of events
        at the US Open or have really strict limits. In Chicago, I was able to
        attempt 2 averages (First round and B-final). I would hate to get two
        chances, not meet the cutoff, and then not get a chance to do anything
        else for that event. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Eivind, Yes.. This was what I was planning to do with Pochmann, only
        I was hoping to be able to get other suggestions, because the movecount
        would be very high. I wonder how much time it would take to do brute
        force searches for a cross, then a brute force search for a F2L pair
        etc. (or different stages, and then slowly get into the 2-gen group(?)).
        Would that be possible? I know PHP is not really the ideal language for
        this, but I thought it would be cool to offer a solution program on my
        website (one that people can just use online)... That's why I want to
        make the movecount relatively low, while I still want to be able to
        write it in as less time as possible :). Anyway, thanks for you help,

        videos : http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=RQssQx22scg &gt; &gt; My current
        maximum memory for memorize cubes is 46. &gt; &gt; I'll keep improving
        my memory for cubes until hit a hundred. &gt; &gt; How do you think?
        &gt; &gt; P.S. I use M2/R2 for solve and AA-XX list for memorize. &gt;
        Thanks for sharing that nice methods! &gt; &gt; &gt; - Ryosuke Mondo -

        I think this is actually a problem if the average scramble currently
        generated for competitions have some attributes that are distinctly
        different from that of an average scramble chosen randomly. A method
        suited to the average competition scramble would have an unfair
        advantage over other methods. I bet that the difference is small enough
        that we can ignore it for all practical purposes, but it still bugs me a
        bit. Would a true random scramble take too long to generate? For
        example, we could have a program generate a random 11-digit binary for
        EO, a random 7-digit trinary (?) for CO, and somehow produce a random
        permutation of both corners and edges so that each one is generated with
        equal probability. The cube configuration defined from these
        informations could be thrown automatically into an optimal cube solver,
        which would spit out the scramble. This way we'll never have to worry
        about scrambles being dependent on the way they are generated. -macky

        I've been planning to post suggested regulations in the WCA forum since
        a while... I think that for now we should make
        random-position-generation (i.e. through Cube Explorer) mandatory for
        high-profile 3x3x3 and on 2x2x2. Such a scheme could be allowed for
        other puzzles but may be optional. And while we're at it, let's add
        Stefan's Megaminx scrambling scheme. Note that the current regulations
        allow random-state-generation as long as the scramble produced from it
        exceeds the regulated scramble length.

        said what I've said, I agree that we should switch scrambling methods.
        An added bonus is that scrambles are shorter: my experience with, say,
        Cube Explorer is that the solutions tend to be less than 20 moves, so
        scrambling would be quicker usually. I guess a drawback is that
        scramblers would be harder to program: now, anyone with minimal
        programming experience can write one, whereas a near-optimal solver is
        needed to write a good scrambler with this scrambling method. Tim

        Congress &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plaza Hotel for the US Open in 2007. I will
        use this data to &gt; &gt; extrapolate &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and help plan
        our options for US Nationals 2008. Hmm... yeah, I &gt; &gt; would &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest Google Docs, but people will be too lazy so if
        you can, &gt; &gt; just reply. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        -Tyson &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        solved isn't the most likely. If you do 3 turns, solved isn't the most

        it isn't possible to have identities of 1,2, or 3 moves, but why is
        solved the most likely outcome? And why does that lead to solves of
        lower depth? And, even if it does, why are solves of depth 15 or 16
        "easier" to speedsolve or blindfoldsolve than solves of depth 18-20? Tim

        Stefan's observation that the actual probability of a EO skip must be
        larger than this (because of the reason I also mentioned earlier). I
        don't know how much larger, but we clearly have a problem then. Any

        is a scrambler. Click "Random" and "Add and Generate" once for each
        scramble you want. Then "File ... Print All Cubes". If I remember
        correctly, the reason why the WCA doesn't do this yet is that it's less
        comfortable and portable than the javascript scrambler currently in use,
        which simply runs in a web browser and produces scrambles instantly.

        Maybe you can make a video of you doing a few solves, and make it sure
        that viewers can actually see what you are doing. That way, people
        (tthat includes me) can give you comments on that. Other than that,
        simple search for 'tips' on this site. Cubers have been repeating the

        Hello, Don't get me wrong, I am not the kind of person monitoring the
        webtraffic everyday, but since I've been making a few changes on my
        website this week, I was interested in looking at the visitors again.
        Funnily enough, in the past month, I had 2000 visitors from the US, who
        spend 3 minutes on my website on average, 10 visitors from South Afrika,
        who spend 20 minutes on my site on average, and 1 visitor from Nigeria
        who spend 38 minutes on my website on average :D. I also had a visitor
        from Adis Abeba, Kenia! I NEVER get hits from Afrika...! The Japanese
        are KING at leaving my site quickly; most people are polite enough to at
        least look at what is the result of my hard work for just 1, eins, uno,
        one, √É¬©√É¬©n minute, but the Japanese are out of there after 51 seconds!
        Maybe its because of the language? Anyway, the peak at the end of each
        year seems to be beginning now, probably influenced by the WC07. Now
        look at the Google Trends: http://tinyurl.com/2bpqzn The question is,
        will this years peak exceed the one in 2006? I bet that it will! -

        Hi Joel :-) What visit counter are you using? Google Analytics? That's
        what i use for some webpages for work. I get an excellent overview of
        any trouble there may be with the sites/pages by analysing the traffic
        that way :D Have fun :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        because of the language? &gt; &gt; Anyway, the peak at the end of each

        I don't think the peak of 2006 will be surpassed by any date, anytime
        soon. I believe the prime cause of cube related searches was because of
        the Pursuit of Happyness, which came out around that time. That gave the
        cube a spark back into the media. I kinda expected another spark after
        the worlds, but I guess I was wrong. Well there is a little bump up, but
        I expecting a sharp increase. What reasons do you think caused sparks at
        the end of each year? Corwin Shiu --- In

        I just checked hits to my beginner solution page, and there was a
        significant spike on 8 October (i.e. the day after Worlds). The hit
        count that day was ~60-65% higher than usual! I usually see a definite
        spike around Christmas time and New Year. I assume this is because lots
        of people get cubes as Christmas presents, and usually have some time
        off around Christmas/New Year and so are more likely to spend time
        surfing the net for cube info. Jasmine On Mon, 29 Oct 2007 02:20:48

        at leaving my site quickly; most people are &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; polite
        enough to at least look at what is the result of my hard work &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; for just 1, eins, uno, one, √É(c)√É(c)n minute, but the Japanese
        are &gt; out of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there after 51 seconds! Maybe its
        because of the language? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway,
        the peak at the end of each year seems to be beginning now, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; probably influenced by the WC07. Now look at the Google
        Trends: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        question is, will this years peak exceed the one in 2006? I bet &gt;

        I don't see why that's obvious. Your first point in particular, if &gt;
        you do 1 turn, solved isn't the most likely. If you do 2 turns (the &gt;
        way that scrambles are generated, so no R R' etc.), solved isn't the
        &gt; most likely. If you do 3 turns, solved isn't the most likely. I
        &gt; understand that it is possible to have a 25 HTM identity while it
        &gt; isn't possible to have identities of 1,2, or 3 moves, but why is
        &gt; solved the most likely outcome? I don't have any theory to back me
        up, it just feels logical to me. It's very possible that I'm wrong here.
        But anyway, this doesn't really matter. The significant bias in EO
        distribution alone should be enough to show that 25 random moves isn't a
        good enough way. &gt; And, even if it does, why are solves of depth 15
        or 16 "easier" &gt; to speedsolve or blindfoldsolve than solves of depth
        18-20? Why wouldn't they be? But I've also got a "proof": a while ago I
        ran a simulation, and the optimal solutions for the first step of Petrus
        method get longer and longer as the length of the scramble increases
        (and it continued after passing 25 moves, IIRC, but I'm not sure where I
        saved the results and in any case I'll redo this in a more suitable
        language). -- Johannes Laire

        I know this might be nit-picking, but I get that the probability of only
        double turns on 2 opposite faces (or possibly no turns on one or both
        faces) from a 25 move random scrambling algorithm is closer to:
        (1/2)*(14/18)*(11.667/18)^24 = 1.17*10^-5 or 0.00001 This is still only
        an approximation of the actual probability because for the first move
        you have the option of choosing a turn on one of our 2 restricted faces
        or one of out 4 non-restricted faces. Choosing a turn on a non
        restricted face means that for your following turn you have now only 11
        possible turns to choose from. If you choose a turn on one of our
        restricted double-turn only faces than for your next move you have only
        13 possible choices for your next turn. Also you have to disallow
        scrambling algs like U D U D U D U D U D U D U D ... which can occur on
        your restricted faces (as F2 B2 F2 B2 ...) or on 2 unrestricted faces.
        What I did for my calculation is to take the weighted average of 11 and
        13 with 11 occuring 2/3 the time and 13 occuring 1/3 the time for the
        number of choices of each successive move after the 1st turn. This is
        not the true probability, but only a closer approximation than
        (14/18)^25 To be honest I don't yet know how to calculate such a
        probability precisely, but I am now very interested in this type of
        question so I will try to look into it. For our math gurus does anyone
        know how to find the exact chance of only double turns, or possibly no
        turns on one or both of any pair of 2 opposite faces from a scrambling
        algorithm? Either way I think (14/18)^25 is a bad approximation because
        it allows for scrambles like (if you restict quarter turns on F and B):
        B2 R L F2 R R' R2 R R R' R2 R R R' R2 F2 D U2 R R' R2 R2 R2 R2 and it
        also allows for scrambles like (with only double turns on R and F, two
        adjacent faces): R2 F2 R2 U D L' D2 F2 R2 B' R2 U2 F2 R2 F2 L' R2 D U2
        F2 R2 F2 R2 D R2 Although I don't know the exact probability I get that
        it is much smaller than 0.0019 for this case, which in my opinion is
        stronger evidence for something like a random state generator scrambler
        for BLD, and probably also for 3x3x3 speed. Is there a way to make a web
        based version of Cube explorer's scramble function? Or to somehow
        integrate Cube Explorer into a web app from someone's server? This
        probably sounds like a dumb newbie computer question because it is ;-)
        but with odds like the ones we are dealing with I also am in favor of
        changing how we scramble for BLD for 3x3x3. This also affects 5x5x5 BLD
        too, and I'm sure there must be some side affect for corner orientation
        as well so it can affect 4x4x4 BLD as well, though only on a very
        limited scale. Chris &gt; &gt; The probability to get a scramble like
        that (no 90 degree turns on &gt; two &gt; &gt; faces) is approximately
        0.0019 ((14/18)^25, should be close to &gt; &gt; correct). &gt; &gt;
        Interesting way to look at it. I confirm your computation, btw. Macky
        &gt; needs a new computer or shouldn't do calculations in dvorak. And I
        &gt; add that the resulting EO skip probability is actually above that,
        &gt; while the desired probability is far below it, namely 0.00049 (1/
        &gt; 2^11). &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        Ok I have to ask the dumb question. Looking at this again from the
        standpoint of evidence for or against using a random state generator to
        scramble for 3x3x3 BLD it seems that our scrambling is not actually so
        bad. If the probability is close to 1*10^-5 for a scramble to have no
        flipped edges (no quarter turns on 2 opposite faces) from a 25 move
        scrambling algorithm and in actuality it is 1/2048 from a random state
        generator or 0.0005 then our scramblers are producing scrambles with no
        flipped edges only 1/50 the time as a true random state generator
        should. So in fact our scramblers are making our scrambles harder from
        the viewpoint of the EO stage than a true random state generator would.
        Am I missing something? Does anyone know the actual probability of a
        current 25 move scrambler producing such a EO free scramble so we can
        stop using approximations? It seems that in fact our scramblers are
        giving us harder scrambles than a true random generator would, at least
        as far as EO goes. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I don't understand your calculation. I tried a quick simulation and it
        got numbers much closer to my approximation than yours, but I will check
        my one-liner and read your message again. Yet another thing that
        confuses matters is that there isn't one single way to generate random
        moves, some people don't allow L come after R for example. I allow both
        orders. The point you are missing is that of course there are other
        scrambles that give solved EO, too (temprorarily disturb it, and restore
        later). Also see message #34941. -- Johannes Laire --- In

        Hi Corwin, So far, the peaks at the end of each year seem te be higher
        everytime, which is why I thought that this years peak will also be
        bigger than last year. As Jasmine Lee pointed out, this has to do with
        people getting it for Christmas and having some more time to surf the
        web and search for info about it. However, I totally forgot how the
        Persuit of Happiness influenced last years peak. That's a significant
        difference of course... It will be exciting to watch... It will be close
        :). - Jo√´l. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Corwin Shiu"

        Happyness, which came out around that time. That &gt; gave the cube a
        spark back into the media. &gt; &gt; I kinda expected another spark
        after the worlds, but I guess I was &gt; wrong. Well there is a little
        bump up, but I expecting a sharp increase. &gt; &gt; What reasons do you

        Don't get me wrong, I am not the kind of person monitoring the &gt; &gt;

        &gt; website this week, I was interested in looking at the visitors
        again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Funnily enough, in the past month, I had 2000
        visitors from the US, &gt; &gt; who spend 3 minutes on my website on
        average, 10 visitors from South &gt; &gt; Afrika, who spend 20 minutes
        on my site on average, and 1 visitor from &gt; &gt; Nigeria who spend 38
        minutes on my website on average :D. I also had a &gt; &gt; visitor from
        Adis Abeba, Kenia! I NEVER get hits from Afrika...! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The Japanese are KING at leaving my site quickly; most people are &gt;
        &gt; polite enough to at least look at what is the result of my hard
        work &gt; &gt; for just 1, eins, uno, one, √É¬©√É¬©n minute, but the
        Japanese are out of &gt; &gt; there after 51 seconds! Maybe its because
        of the language? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, the peak at the end of each
        year seems to be beginning now, &gt; &gt; probably influenced by the
        WC07. Now look at the Google Trends: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://tinyurl.com/2bpqzn &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The question is, will this
        years peak exceed the one in 2006? I bet &gt; &gt; that it will! &gt;

        Hi Johannes, &gt; 100,000 JNet scrambles: &gt; {41, 0, 2764, 0, 22444,
        0, 44173, 0, 26360, 0, 3970, 0, 248}, I have to admit I don't understand
        what those numbers mean. I get that 41 is the EO number, but what does
        the 41 itself mean? 41 of the 100,000 cases had solved EO (no flipped
        edges)? The EP number certainly can't mean that you had a solved edge
        permutation, what do the permutation numbers measure? As to my
        calculation, please don't hold me to that number exactly as it in itself
        is an approximation because I don't know how to calculate such a
        complicated situation precisely. My thinking was this. (14/18)^25 has 2
        very major flaws in reasoning. For one it allows multiple turns of the
        same slice in a row, stuff like R R' R2 R R' even to the extreme of 25
        turns on the same face. The larger problem is that it would allow
        exactly 2 turns of the same face in a row during a scramble, which
        occurs with far more frequency that silly cases like 25 turns on the
        same side. The second flaw in reasoning is that it does not count the
        probability of restricting no quarter turns to two opposite faces only,
        it only finds for simply 2 faces. This means you can restrict moves on 2
        adjacent faces, which can still leave flipped edges in the end. There
        are 12 ways to choose 2 adjacent faces to restrict and only 3 ways to
        choose 2 opposite faces to restrict. So this probability is already
        counting 5 times as many cases as it should due to allowing restrictions
        on any 2 faces and not just 2 opposite ones. Actually looking at this
        further in depth my calculation does have an error then. When choosing
        the faces to restrict there is not a 1/2 chance of choosing 2 opposite
        faces but actually 1/5. Assume the centers are fixed in space (we
        scramble with white on top and green front as standard). There are 15
        ways to choose 2 faces to restrict, but only 3 of those choices are
        choices of 2 opposite faces so I should have used 3/15 instead of 1/2.
        So my initial approximation had an error. I would actually get
        (1/5)*(14/18)*(11/667/18)^24 = 4.7*10^-6 or 0.000005 which is even
        smaller of a chance than my previous calculation by a factor of 2.5 If
        this is off from the theoretical distribution I imagine it comes from
        the term (11.667/18)^24 which is my way of trying to approximate the
        fact that the number of choices of possible turns after the very first
        turn of the scramble depends on if you just turned one of your
        restricted faces or one of your unrestricted faces. By restricted face I
        mean one of the ones where you are only allowed to turn double turns. If
        my calculation is wrong I am willing to look at it again and try to
        correct it. But I still find those 2 major flaws for (14/18)^25 so I
        don't think we should use that as our approximation of the probability.
        (14/18)^25 is a greater probability than the actual one for this type of
        scramble because it overcounts for 2 different reasons, both of which I
        mentioned above. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Click on "its results" under "3x3 scramble analyzer". And here's yet
        another approximation: Whatever scrambles you allow or forbid, unless
        you favor one axis over another we can expect 1/3 of all turns to be F
        or B. Each of those turns has a 1/3 probability of not being a quarter
        turn. So the probability to never get quarter turns on F or B should be
        about: (1/3) ^ (25/3) = 0.000106 = 1/9463 The general flaw in this of
        course is that with higher number of moves we can make the result of
        this and the other formulas arbitrarily small, because they don't take
        into account "restoring" edge orientation. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Stefan, Well, maybe I can do that later.. For now I like to play
        around with it myself. One of the problems is that I basically simulate
        the whole cube (using functions I wrote a long time ago) which isn't
        really needed for checking only EP.. Maybe that takes some extra time?
        In some cases, it finds quick solutions in 2 seconds, but Erik gave me a
        10 flip, and that took longer than a minute!! I should also note, that I
        am only using quarter turns and no R2,L2 etc. for this step. Could that

        Using 2-cycles: look for a cubie which belongs to the top layer(or the
        layer you want to solve), shoot to that position, and then solve the
        cubie. Normally it would be 8 swap for the edges and 8 for the corners.
        It's not efficient, as you can see.

        I think these are the kinds of things that just comes with practice.
        Keep at it and your recognition times will drop eventually. There are
        only that many OLLs, PLLs and F2Ls, and every time you solve a cube you
        improve your ability to recognize just a little bit. Eivind --- In

        Hi again, Since I asked for the videos, I thought I should give some
        comments: 1. It looks like you are using your 'full hand' to twist the U
        face sometimes. This looks sluggish, and indeed slows you down. There's
        many way's to do U2 without grabbing the whole layer. I call this
        'screw-driving' btw. And like a great man once said: "Speedcubing is a
        more like playing a piano rather than screwdriving". This applies to all
        triggers. RUR' RU'R' and all that stuff. It's twice as slow when you use
        your whole hand to do the U move, rather than just the left or right
        index finger. Especially also pay attention to the left index finger.
        How do you perform RUR'U'? I would guess that you don't use the left
        index of U'. IMO; It's a perfect opportunity to let your hands
        cooperate! (I could be wrong about this btw... I saw you using your left
        index a few times...) 2. It looks like you are sometimes using d'/d
        without know where this is leading. If you are looking for pieces, I
        recommend doing U'/Us and peeking behind the cube without regripping. 3.
        The F' and F in the Y perm should be done without regripping the cube.
        Practice triggers like R'FRF' and other combinations like this while
        holding the cube in the 'standard' grip (whatever that means ;)). I
        guess that's enough for now. Oh.. I have a tips page:

        consider it very very lucky. I have yet to try this scramble... I'll
        probably get 10 minutes because I'm horrible at BLD. Brian -----

        Hi, &gt; Could &gt; it be possible to define more steps in between the 4
        subgroups, to &gt; make the solution longer but the algorithm faster?
        Well, the Thistlethwaite 52-move algorithm and Ryan Heise's "Human
        Thistlethwaite" algorithm both divide stages 2, 3, 4 into two sub-steps
        each. But I'm guessing you're wondering about using &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B2&gt;
        in between &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B&gt; and &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2&gt;,
        &lt;U,D,L,R2,F2,B2&gt; in between &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2&gt; and
        &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt;, and &lt;U,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt; in between
        &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt; and &lt;U2,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt;. I would say no
        because &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B2&gt;=&lt;U,D,L,R,F,B&gt;,
        &lt;U,D,L,R2,F2,B2&gt;=&lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2&gt;, and
        &lt;U,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt;=&lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt;. (This was easy to
        confirm using GAP.) You could consider other in-between groups like:
        &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2,R U2 D2 L'&gt; in between &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2&gt; and
        &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2&gt;, but I think at least Ryan's sub-steps are
        essentially doing this same sort of thing. - Bruce --- In

        Jeff, for OLL I got a tip (I use the same stuff for COLL while doing
        VH/ZBF2L) When putting down the last pair, look at the OLL-case "all
        ther way". Most turns used to put in the last pair does not change much
        of the last layer. So you can start to look at the case while doing the
        pair. I do the same thing for PE while ending my COLL, I actually know
        my PE-case almost all times before COLL is done. But PE is wery easy to
        spot, guess it's harder to do for PLL, but still useful. // Kenneth ---

        Hi, I didn't mean subgroups.. But I have some ideas for this. An example
        would be to orient the corners by searching for moves to have 2 oriented
        corners at DLF and DLB, then seaching for 2 gen (RU) to orient the other
        ones. Should be quite fast, because it will only search for algo's with
        R and U. But I am working on that now :). I am basically going to do a
        similar thing for the edges orientation (don't worry, *not* with 2-gen
        :p), since the brute force search I use now is a bit too slow, I think.
        I'll break it up into steps that are only 3 or 4 moves away :). - Jo√´l

        &gt; Also, I've looked into Thistlethwaite a bit more, and it's quite
        &gt; &gt; interesting. I also found Ryan Heise's Humans Thistlethwaite.
        Could &gt; &gt; it be possible to define more steps in between the 4

        I found the Congress Plaza way to expensive so I decided to stay 50
        meters further down the road at the Chicago Hostel. I had an amazing
        time over there! Some other (European) cubers also stayed there. Staying
        at the "official" hotel has the advantage of meeting more cubers so if

        Y Y B Y &gt; &gt; G B R &gt; When solving COLL, you need to first do the
        F2L and orient the last layer edges. Your edges aren't oriented. The UB
        and UR edges are flipped. Do some searches on VH or ZBF2L to figure out
        how to orient these edges efficiently while you are solving the F2L. If
        we ignore that problem and just look at the corners, you can see that
        this is the COLL triple-sune (L) case. This is because there are two
        diagonally opposite corners that are correctly oriented, and the other
        two corners are not oriented. You need to do a U' move first to make the
        face line up the same as Bob's diagram. Next, look at the first two
        non-yellow stickers in the left and right columns. In your case, it
        looks like this: Blue Blue Orange Red Because Blue occurs twice, use it
        as your F color. When Blue is in front, orange is on the left and red is
        on the right, so these stickers are rewritten as F F L R This matches
        case #13 on Bob's page.

        you'll be able to see this instantly from any angle. When I'm looking at

        looks like you are using your 'full hand' to twist the U face &gt;
        sometimes. This looks sluggish, and indeed slows you down. There's &gt;
        many way's to do U2 without grabbing the whole layer. I call &gt; this
        'screw-driving' btw. And like a great man once &gt; said: "Speedcubing
        is a more like playing a piano rather than &gt; screwdriving". This
        applies to all triggers. RUR' RU'R' and all that &gt; stuff. It's twice
        as slow when you use your whole hand to do the U &gt; move, rather than
        just the left or right index finger. Especially &gt; also pay attention
        to the left index finger. &gt; &gt; How do you perform RUR'U'? I would
        guess that you don't use the left &gt; index of U'. IMO; It's a perfect
        opportunity to let your hands &gt; cooperate! (I could be wrong about
        this btw... I saw you using your &gt; left index a few times...) &gt;
        &gt; 2. It looks like you are sometimes using d'/d without know where
        &gt; this is leading. If you are looking for pieces, I recommend doing
        &gt; U'/Us and peeking behind the cube without regripping. &gt; &gt; 3.
        The F' and F in the Y perm should be done without regripping the &gt;
        cube. Practice triggers like R'FRF' and other combinations like this
        &gt; while holding the cube in the 'standard' grip (whatever that &gt;
        means ;)). &gt; &gt; I guess that's enough for now. Oh.. I have a tips

        Hi! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been speedcubing for nine months now and
        I've been stuck &gt; at &gt; &gt; 25- &gt; &gt; &gt; 40 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; seconds for a while and I really would like to get better &gt;
        times. &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; know &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I should
        learn more oll cases and stuff, but I don't think &gt; that &gt; &gt;
        &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help too much. So do you have tips for me
        so I could get &gt; better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Eivind Hi Eivind, My PHP cube solver is going to take a while
        to finish, and it's not going to be anything special. It's not going to
        be very practical either. It would be more practical to generate random
        cube states that we can then input into Acube or cube explorer to get
        scrambles :). I really like the idea of using a solver to scramble it's
        way into a (pseudo)random position. - Jo√´l

        Hi :-) Instead of "reinventing the wheel" with a PHP solver IMHO it is a
        better idea to turn ACube into a webapplication by making it an applet
        and adding a nice GUI. I see more potential in this personally :-) Yes i
        know abut Ryan's page to assist in setting up ACube input, but it does
        not implement ACube itself. We would need Josef's permission and
        cooperation (?) to proceed with this ... Stay twisted :-P -Per &gt; ---

        Hi everyone, A funny thing happened me tonight, and the subject of this
        thread is the first thought that popped into my head when it did ;-)
        Tonight I had to run some papers to a coworker at home for some
        advertising things for the business I work for. I was at work and she
        gave me the directions over the phone and I wrote them down on a sticky
        note with the intention of taking it with me. I had to wait about 20
        minutes to talk with customers before I left, and when I did I forgot
        the sticky note with the directions! I didn't realize this until I was
        already driving to her house though. Rather than go back and get the
        directions I decided to try to remember the note. I pictured the sticky
        note on the desk next to the keyboard where I had written it, and slowly
        but surely the image of my handwriting and the directions on the note
        came back to me. Eventually I was able to recall the entire note and
        made it to her house! The route was along roads that I am not very
        familiar with, and I had to take 7 roads to get to her house from work,
        in addition to remembering the house number. This is less information
        than a 3x3x3 cube for which I average 10 images. Still it was close
        enough to a 3x3x3 cube solve that it made me laugh. So yes, BLD cubing
        can actually help for things in the real world ;-) Chris

        I practice during statistics. I read 6-10 homework problem numbers off
        the wall and write them on my paper. And in general I practice
        memorizing things. In "The Pursuit of Happyness," when Chris is given
        the long phone number, I inevitably thought to myself that he should
        have praticed his BLD more... :-) -Lucas Garron [Non-text portions of

        I'm planning to hold a competition in Pleasantville, New York (about
        &gt; 45 minutes north of New York City) on Saturday, November 3. The
        &gt; contest will start at around 9:30 AM. Right now I'm trying to get
        an &gt; idea of how many people would be interested. &gt; &gt; Right now
        I'm planning on holding the following events: 3x3 &gt; speedsolve, 2x2
        speedsolve, 4x4 speedsolve, 5x5 speedsolve, 3x3 &gt; one-handed, 3x3
        blindfolded, magic, master magic. &gt; &gt; Other events may be held if
        there's enough interest. &gt; &gt; The venue is the Pleasantville
        Presbyterian Church at 400 Bedford Road &gt; in Pleasantville.
        Registration will probably cost $5.00 to cover the &gt; cost of the
        room. &gt; &gt; Email me or post here if you're interested or have any
        requests for &gt; other events. &gt; &gt; Tim &gt;

        Hey guys... If you live in the Chicago area or would be willing to
        travel here, for a November 6-7 trade show (costs can be covered), read
        on. A company is looking to pay someone to come to a trade show and be
        their cubing expert. Since I'm only 30 miles out of Chicago, I would
        consider it, but I am fresh out of vacation time. I did a trade show
        once in the past and it can be fun. It sounded from the original e- mail
        (somewhat trimmed, below) that compensation was at least somewhat
        negotiable. Anyways, if you are interested, please respond to this
        e-mail address. Unfortunately, I do not stay up to date with the Yahoo
        groups, so if you only respond to the group, I might not notice in time
        (sorry). I will send you their contact information as quickly as I can,
        if you are interested. - Grant --- Original Message --- PMSI is the

        If you read the rules official sport stacking rules
        http://tinyurl.com/25au9h in the section Stackmat: Positions you will
        see that they require you to start and stop with the hands, any portion
        above the wrist and up to the fingers. So this particular run is a
        scratch (DNF) because he didn't stop with his hands. Also this run is
        doubly a scratch because his hands were in contact with the cups as he
        stopped the timer. That's like a DNF *and* a pop for 3x3x3 BLD right as
        you stop the timer ;-) That kid is really really good though, so I
        imagine he'll pull some awesome time in competition assuming he doesn't
        get nervous. But that particular run is a scratch for 2 separate
        reasons. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Tyson

        His beginner's method is perfect for me. Also blindfolded record holder

        Hello everybody, My PHP solver is just about finished. It's really
        nothing special, and the code got pretty messy, but I am so glad that it
        works, that I just wanted to share this :). I just tested with 10 pseudo
        random scrambles, and the average move count of the solutions was 56
        moves. The solutions range from 50-60, with some lower and higher
        scores. The script can be found here (there is no link on my home-page
        yet): http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=solver If you want to
        generate a string with 54 letters (to use as input), you can go here:
        http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=view Enter a scramble, click the
        radio button "GENERATOR", and click go!. On the bottom of the page you
        will find a sticker code that you can use as input for the solver. You
        can also use these, if you like:

        I am very happy that I managed to make this script. I learned a lot from

        Nice work, Jo√´l : ) I tried this scramble: (x2) D' L' B' L2 R U2 B R' D2
        B' L' R2 B2 L R' B2 U F' D' R' B L2 R2 D2 L2 (x2) and it gave me this: B

        F' D2 B F' R2 L2 U2 R2 L2 R2 L2 U D' F2 B2 F2 R2 D' L2 R2 U L2 F2 U D2
        the statistics say "Total (including cancelations) 53" if I understood
        correctly, it "knows" there are cancelations but it's not cancelling the

        some parts there, like ...U2 R 2 L2 R2 L2 U... and ...D' F2 B2 F2 R2...
        and get 53-4-2 = 47 moves :) or did I understand it all wrong? Pedro

        None the less, I felt my 2x2 was quite a bit better (albeit still lousy)
        after lubing. I used my regular silicone lubricant and just sprayed into
        3 orthogonal faces in the dead center with one of those long thin straw
        attachments. Worked it in for a few seconds then let dry. It's still not
        very good, but I found it to be an improvement. -Daniel --- In

        What method are you using now? It's surely not complete Thistlethwaite,
        since that should lead to a maximum of 45 moves and an average of 31.3
        moves, even before canceling moves between the four steps. For the
        solution display, why not use one applet instead of those many images?
        Then it's also easy to follow for people who don't even know the
        notation or who don't want to toggle between looking at the cube image
        and the move written on the side. Especially if you consider the
        noncuber who has to compare his own cube with the cube image after every
        move and thus even looks away from the screen and could look back at the
        screen at a wrong row. An applet would solve all these issues. If you
        want to keep the images, an improvement would be to draw arrows *on* the

        Hi Jeff, The notation that my algorithm viewer supports is a lot simpler
        than the applet. I didn't feel need to code it so it recognises 2',
        because R2 and R2' are basically the same. You can only add 1 extra
        symbol to a move, either ' or 2. The information IS transported to the
        applet though, which does support R2'. - Jo√´l. --- In

        Hi Jeff, By coincidence, I found that R2' does work (which I believe is
        a more common notation than R'2 anyway). Both the applet and image
        respond correctly to this. - Jo√´l. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@...m,

        The notation that my algorithm viewer supports is a lot simpler than
        &gt; the applet. I didn't feel need to code it so it recognises 2', &gt;
        because R2 and R2' are basically the same. You can only add 1 extra &gt;
        symbol to a move, either ' or 2. The information IS transported to &gt;
        the applet though, which does support R2'. &gt; &gt; - Jo√´l. &gt; &gt;

        Hi Johannes, I know it looks very unproffessional, but Cube Explorer
        give R R' as a solution to a solved state... I just thought it would be
        funny to have an identity algorithm for a solved state... And.. Also,
        this is what cube explorer gave me for this situation (believe it or
        not). The method is: 1. Orient edges 2. Orient corners &amp; bring E
        layer edges in E layer 3. Separate U/D layer pieces, first corners, then
        edges 4. Permute everything (first E layer, then U and D layer
        simultaneously). I know it's not Thistlethwaite... The brute force
        searches were taking too long (my fault, I know, inexperienced in this
        sort of scripting/programming), so I decided to try a different
        approach. Now that I am finished, I some ideas about how to do faster
        searches, but don't feel any need to start writing that now. I am just
        happy that it works. - Jo√É¬´l. --- In

        Yes, my Cube Explorer does the same if you let it solve the Identitiy

        I was by Macky to post something to this site, so here goes. It all
        started because I was speaking with a co-worker one day about the rubiks
        cube and how I had never figured out how to solve it. Well he convinced
        me to take Macky's challenge: "07/09: I'd like to see someone who
        doesn't know how to solve a cube learn to solve it blindfolded. Would
        some brave soul please give it a try? It really shouldn't be too hard.
        You'd be the only person in the world who can say, "I can solve a
        Rubik's Cube, but only blindfolded" (ok, of course you can use the
        blindfold method with you eyes open, but you know what I mean)." Well
        last night I finally successfully solved the cube for the first time and
        it was blindfolded. There were many failed attempts before that, and I
        started in July shortly after the challenge. So it only took me ~4
        months to get a completed solve. Now in my defense, I have a wife and 2
        kids (8 year old and a 16 month old), so I was only able dedicate a few
        hours a week to this. Plus I was very slow in actually memorizing the
        algorithms. The experience was both fun and frustrating at the same
        time. The frustrating part was of course thinking I had it solved then
        looking at the cube and seeing it just as scrambled as when I started.
        The funny thing is I have trouble looking at the cube now as I do the
        algorithms, as I had forced myself to practiced all of them with my eyes
        closed. ----- JNetCube Session Statistics for Sun Nov 04 22:47:27 EST

        Actually, i would recommend you use this tutorial, simply because it
        uses pre-existing algorithms from the fridrich method:
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/ Then, once you
        understand it (and can solve it consistently blindfolded), switch to the

        Hi Ron, I shot the video myself, because Rama told me this guy was
        stopping like this all the time. It didn't look like the judge knew art.
        A6c of the WCA regulations; nothing happened really. Kai also told me
        that this person always stops the timer this way. It's not a big deal to
        me; I doubt that it saves time, but when we have rules, it's a good
        thing they are enforced properly. Do you know if anyone ever got a 2
        second penalty for stopping the timer with wrists in an official

        Hi, Yes, that's the way to do it... Possibly, I can add a text field
        that allows you to input a scramble. It should not be very hard, since
        most of the functions are already written. It's a good idea...
        (Basically the 2nd example already does this, it just generates a random
        scramble). So thanks for the suggestion, maybe I'll add that sometime. -

        functions &gt; are already written. It's a good idea... (Basically the
        2nd example &gt; already does this, it just generates a random
        scramble). &gt; &gt; So thanks for the suggestion, maybe I'll add that
        sometime. &gt; &gt; - Jo√´l. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        One of the first things I had to do was be able to recognize the colors
        for each of my positions. I used the numbering scheme on
        http://www.cubefreak.net. I chose blue as my top and green as my front,
        mainly because the java app on http://www.cubefreak.net had the cube
        oriented that way and it was easier for me to visualize what the
        algorithms were doing and what it should look like when it was done. I
        practice the algorithms on both a solved cube and a scrambled cube.
        Practicing means I was looking at the algorithm on a cheat sheet and
        executing them on the cube under the table. Of course I looked after I
        had executed the algorithm to see if I done it right. If I ended up
        scrambling it accidentally while practicing an algorithm on a solved
        cube (which happened quite a few times) I had co-worker, Mike Hughey
        solve it for me. Initially I stared with only the corner algorithms
        until I had those algorithms memorized. I even tried solving just the
        corners on a 3x3, which I guess technically was a blindfold 2x2. Then I
        worked on edges which took me a while, but I didn't try just solving the
        edges on a scrambled cube. If I needed the cube solved I gave it to Mike
        and he solved it. When I was actually trying to solve it blindfolded and
        failed, Mike, who is very patient, would solve it so I could scramble it
        again. Initially I was just messing it up randomly, then he pointed me
        to JNetCube which I started using. Of course technically I could after
        having memorized all the algorithms (or just some of the really key one)
        could have solved it sighted, I just didn't solve one unless it was
        blindfolded. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Clancy

        Thats true. I don't know about the speedstacking regulations, but I
        tihnk that you have to stop the timer with your hands. I could be wrong,
        but that Cycle the kid did should be a DNF. Otherwise, he's good. -----

        Quite the contrary! Why do you think Mike made Jeff do this? He was

        Hi Joel :-) It is quite easy to code so that you transform for instance
        R L R2 to R' L. Code a sequence tokenizer with axial control. You have
        the first part anyway. Assign RL FB UD to same axes. Example: Sequence:
        R L2 R U2 D2 U' ... (R2 L2 U D2 ...) Steps: R &gt; add to RL axis -
        RL[1]=1 L2 &gt; add to RL axis - RL[2]=2 R &gt; add to RL axis -
        RL[1]=2(1+1) (switch here ... output from RL &gt;&gt; R2 L2, empty the
        axis too!!!) U2 &gt; add to UD axis - UD[1]=2 D2 &gt; add to UD axis -
        UD[2]=2 U' &gt; add -1 to UD axis - UD[1]=1 (2-1) (switch ...) I promise
        you, this is EASIER to code than a solver ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; Hi, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, that's the way to do it...
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Possibly, I can add a text field that
        allows you to input a &gt; &gt; &gt; scramble. It should not be very
        hard, since most of the &gt; functions &gt; &gt; &gt; are already
        written. It's a good idea... (Basically the 2nd &gt; example &gt; &gt;
        &gt; already does this, it just generates a random scramble). &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So thanks for the suggestion, maybe I'll add that
        sometime. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Jo√´l. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi everyone, I have a question that one of the other math tutors asked
        me at the math center I work at. The question was, is there a way to
        solve the following equation algebraically? 3^x + 4^x = 7 What I mean by
        this is can you solve this simply by manipulating the equation, or
        converting it to an equivalent problem in another branch of mathematics
        (elliptic curves maybe?) and thereby derive the answer x=1? Our tutor,
        who studies at University, asked his professor and the professor said
        you would most likely need to solve it using numerical methods, or with
        a calculator or computer. This also leads into the question of how many
        solutions are there to the above equation if you allow x to be a real
        number, or if you allow x to be a complex number? Thanks, Chris

        Now that I've had a chance to look at this problem I don't think there
        are any solutions to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 7 where x is a complex
        number (a + bi). If you let x be a complex number then 3^x + 4^x = 7
        turns into 3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) +
        4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln(4))) In order for this to be a solution I
        want to get rid of the terms involving the sin() function and the i. But
        to do this I would need a real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer
        multiple of 2*pi while simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer
        multiple of 2*pi. There is the trivial case where b=0 but then the value
        of x isn't really a complex number. Am I right in my reasoning that
        there is no solution to this equation among the complex numbers, or is
        there an error in my reasoning here? I am assuming that because the
        exponential functions 3^x and 4^x are one-to-one that there is only 1
        real number such that 3^x + 4^x = 7 and therefore any potential complex
        number solution must use this somehow. Thanks, Chris --- In

        Hi :-) Obviously there is a real number solution (x=1) such that 3^x +
        4^x = 7. This is trivial. It's too long since i did complex numbers at
        uni so i cannot really help you out on this one with complex numbers.
        I'm pondering the possibility of 2 real solutions, one other where x is
        negative. Hmm ... Can we generalise any conlusions for other equations:

        I don't think a real solution with x &lt; 0 would exist. The function y
        = 3^x + 4^x is strictly increasing (also continuous and &gt; 0). So y is

        Hi Joel :-) I looked at the solver again. Now it looks very good!! I,
        like Stefan did, wonder what is the solution strategy. I can see you do
        orient all then permute all. What i dont understand is: what exactly is
        the separation stage? And is your approach similar to what Zbibniew

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Possibly, I can add a text field that allows

        &gt; &gt; move &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count of the

        exponential equations Hi :-) Obviously there is a real number solution
        (x=1) such that 3^x + 4^x = 7. This is trivial. It's too long since i
        did complex numbers at uni so i cannot really help you out on this one
        with complex numbers. I'm pondering the possibility of 2 real solutions,
        one other where x is negative. Hmm ... Can we generalise any conlusions
        for other equations: a^x + b^x = c^x (where a+b=c) ?? -Per &gt; --- In

        3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln (4)))

        &gt; &gt; 3^x + 4^x = 7 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I mean by this is can

        using numerical &gt; &gt; methods, or with a calculator or computer.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This also leads into the question of how many
        solutions are there to &gt; &gt; the above equation if you allow x to be
        a real number, or if you allow &gt; &gt; x to be a complex number? &gt;

        You can take the first derivative of f(x) = 3^x + 4^x to convince

        well i suggest putting sand in it again (not too much), but this time

        Did you wash them and relubricate? I sand all my cubes (with sandpaper)
        and it decreases lockups. I'm sure your cube will be fine as long as the

        WARNING do this at your own risk. i dont know if anybody has done this
        already but my friend used petroleum jelly as a lubricant for my cube.
        my cube instantly and virtually made no noise at all! also, it worked as
        fine as any other lubricant. the catch is that it is AWFULLY sticky if
        you decide you don't want to use it as an lubricant any more. its also
        pretty greasy at first.

        Dan is correct here. Lucas is correct with using numerical methods to
        obtain the other complex solutions. The original eqution is highly
        non-algebraic so there's really no good way of attacking it manually.
        Although what Chris started doing with expanding it with x=a+bi
        (sometimes x=r*e^(i*theta)) is a standard way of approaching it, but it
        tends to be a dead-end, as well as insufficent for obtaining the entire
        solution set. Chris: It seems to be like you are being asked a lot of
        impossible questions, or questions of an inappropriate level at your
        job. I've found it best to flag these out as quick as possible, give a
        brief explanation, and move on to something more productive. Many
        questions in math don't lead to anything satisfing I've found. Unless of
        course you want to be a math professor, then you have to know
        everything, both the good and the bad. Erm... can't brush it off by
        saing things like that never show up either. I suppose equations like
        that DO unfortuantely show up in physics or engineering sometimes, but
        this is what we have an entire field of "Numerical Methods" for... Not
        the most beautiful branch of mathematics I'd say. -Doug --- In

        that I've had a chance to look at this problem I don't think &gt; &gt;
        there &gt; &gt; &gt; are any solutions to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 7
        where x is a complex &gt; &gt; &gt; number (a + bi). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If you let x be a complex number then &gt; &gt; &gt; 3^x + 4^x
        = 7 turns into &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin (b*ln &gt;
        &gt; (4))) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order for this to be a
        solution I want to get rid of the terms &gt; &gt; &gt; involving the
        sin() function and the i. But to do this I would &gt; &gt; need a &gt;
        &gt; &gt; real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi
        while &gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple
        of 2*pi. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is the trivial case where
        b=0 but then the value of x isn't &gt; &gt; &gt; really a complex
        number. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I right in my reasoning that
        there is no solution to this &gt; &gt; equation &gt; &gt; &gt; among the
        complex numbers, or is there an error in my reasoning &gt; &gt; here?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I am assuming that because the exponential functions 3^x
        and 4^x &gt; &gt; are &gt; &gt; &gt; one-to-one that there is only 1
        real number such that 3^x + 4^x = 7 &gt; &gt; &gt; and therefore any
        potential complex number solution must use this &gt; &gt; somehow. &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Hi everyone, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a
        question that one of the other math tutors asked me at &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; math center I work at. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The question was, is there a way to solve the following
        equation &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algebraically? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 3^x + 4^x = 7 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What I mean by this is can you solve this simply by manipulating &gt;
        &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equation, or converting it to an equivalent
        problem in another &gt; &gt; branch &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of mathematics
        (elliptic curves maybe?) and thereby derive the &gt; &gt; answer &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; x=1? Our tutor, who studies at University, asked his
        professor &gt; &gt; and the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; professor said you would
        most likely need to solve it using &gt; &gt; numerical &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; methods, or with a calculator or computer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; This also leads into the question of how many solutions
        are there &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the above equation if you
        allow x to be a real number, or if you &gt; &gt; allow &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; x to be a complex number? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thanks, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        There is nothing wrong with using Petroleum Jelly I think. It's
        incredibly inert too (hence safe for the plastic). But I don't see why a
        well placement of any other lubricant wouldn't stop spring creak noise
        either. If it's acting sticky then you are probably using too much. Just
        take it apart and wipe off the excess. A little bit of it goes a long
        way, especially if it's coated nice and evenly. When it starts doing
        this adding a few drops of water might help too. The polar/non-polar
        combination is fun to play with I've found. --- In

        ok well it depends on what you're trying to do, and at which point you
        are in the solve. if you have just that position left, then you'd want

        &gt; Lucas Garron Cool! It's neat to see that there are complex number
        solutions to this equation! Also, and I ask this because I haven't
        really studied complex numbers in much depth before, are there 2 and
        *only* 2 complex solutions to this equations? It appears from your graph
        that perhaps there could be an infinite number of solutions? Or am I
        incorrect here? &gt; &gt; 3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) +
        4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln &gt; (4))) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order for
        this to be a solution I want to get rid of the terms &gt; &gt; involving
        the sin() function and the i. But to do this I would &gt; need a &gt;
        &gt; real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi
        while &gt; &gt; simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple of
        2*pi. *puts foot in mouth* Ok I see my error in reasoning here. After
        distributing I can also get rid of those terms with an imaginary part if
        3^a*i*sin(b*ln(3)) = -4^a*i*sin(b*ln(4)) This actually gives a system of
        equations to find any complex number solution (a+bi): 1)
        3^a*i*sin(b*ln(3)) = -4^a*i*sin(b*ln(4)) 2) 3^a*cos(b*ln(3)) +
        4^a*cos(b*ln(4)) = 7 &gt;From this system of equations I would guess
        that there are an infinite number of complex number solutions. The real
        part of any complex number solution to this equation would have to stay
        the same I'm thining, but the imaginary part b, because it is contained
        withing the sin and cos funtions, can take on an infinite number of
        possibilities since those functions are periodic. I probably worded that
        very poorly, but I think you see what I mean. Doug I also appreciate
        your comment too about not worrying so much about these types of
        questions. I did personally find it to be an interesting question, which
        is why I posted it, but in the big scheme of things that is true I guess
        it doesn't really apply very well to us only having to tutor up to high
        school level students ;-) Chris

        OK, the score-cards are right here... Between magic and master magic, I
        judged 5 people, my dad judged 7, Bob judged 3, Mitchell's dad judged 4,
        someone else (the signature does not look familiar at the moment) judged
        3, and Jaclyn (Bob's girlfriend) judged 1 person. So most of the people

        Hi, I have already try this method(without knowing CLL), and it seems
        you forgot a step. step1: 4 pairs minus the cross step2:CLL step3:you
        said "simultaneosly solve the edges of the top and bottom layers". I
        think that isnt clear enough, if you mean just orient U and D edges,
        then you still have to put them in their correct layer with another
        step. then your 4th step could be an edge permutation(which permute U
        and D edges). There are some things I remember from this method: First,
        when you have solves your 4 F2L pairs, your centers could be in a bad
        place. then you have really unfair moves to do. If you place your
        centers correctly, then the method is like a Roux Method but it ends
        with 8 edges(contrary to Roux's method which end with only 6 edges).
        Your 8 edges could be oriented using only UMD moves( only MU moves for
        Roux's one). The other thing I remember is that algs used to permute U
        and D edges (for example the one you need when you have to do a Z-PLL on
        both U and D faces) are maybe not very long, but to my mind very unfair
        to recognize. So my point of view is that this method is very close to
        Roux's one,BUT you don't have more freedom when you build your 4 F2L
        pairs than when you build 2 1*2*3 blocks. So you should maybe solve DR
        and DL edges after your step2, in order to follow Roux's method and
        simplify your last step which is too complicated to be achieved in
        speedcubing.(Maybe this method could be fine in FMC but the slice moves
        are very bad for that...). To conclude, in my opinion this method isnt
        really better than Roux's one, and Roux's one is (maybe) easier to
        recognize. PS:btw if you dont forgot a step, your step4 means you
        permute all U and D edges when they are oriented but you dont know if
        they are in their correct layer...If I remember, there are tooooo many
        cases to learn...tooo many to be efficient if I remember... I hope my
        answer can help you, tell me if I'm wrong or if I forgot something.

        If it pops, tighten the screws (really nothing else to do). If it then
        turns too tightly, I suggest you work it in for a few days (even DIYs
        need this IMO). After that you can lube it. cube4you.com sells some DIY
        kits of various types, which have gotten good reviews from reliable
        cubers. I really haven't paid attention to the development in this area,

        turns very &gt; smoothly, and very freely, but rather than locking up
        when you try to &gt; turn it at the wrong spot, it simply pops and
        flings pieces &gt; everywhere! The cube is very smooth, but way too
        fragile. What is the &gt; problem with this? &gt; &gt; I am afraid to
        put the center caps on because once you glue them, you &gt; can't really
        take them off. The problem is, if I tighten my cube, it &gt; will be
        less likely to pop, it won't turn as easily, which defeats the &gt;
        purpose of a rubiks.com DIY. &gt; &gt; Can somebody else who owns one of
        these things tell me what to do? &gt;

        If your cube pops all the time, that means it's too loose. You just have
        to tighten it up until it doesn't pop all the time on you. You can still
        have a fairly loose cube without it popping. To:

        Rubik's Ice Cube isn't that new. It's been out for a while. It's
        basically a 2x2x2 cube but transparent. The color scheme for it is the

        Ok, so i bought a 5x5 from mefferts
        (http://sites.webec.com.hk/meffert/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail&amp;id=284367&amp;product=125)
        the other day and as i was superglueing the tiles on i got some glue
        between layers. I was forced to disassemble the cube to get it unstuck,
        and somehow i managed to break a center piece in the process as well as
        having 4 of my center caps disappear somehow. If anyone has some extra
        parts or knows of where i can get some spare parts (i contacted mefferts
        and they won't help me out) then i would very much appreciate it and am
        willing to pay however much you think is fair. If anyone can help please
        send me a msg at richard16meyer at gmail dot com . Thanks!

        I think all will agree that 25 half turns (of totally 25) in a scramble
        is a bad scramble. 24 is slightly better. And 23 is still better. Common
        sense tells me that this tendency (i.e. bettering the scramble) will go
        on all the way, as the number of HT goes towards zero. But obviously I¬¥m
        mistaken; there is a consensus amongst makers of scrambling algorithms
        that the optimal scrambling is recieved, when the number of HT is in
        average one third of the given length. Can anyone explain to me (simply)
        the reasoning behind this value? R [Non-text portions of this message

        combine both solutions, you came up with the whole 5x5x5 solved. So here
        is my method : 1st step : make the F, B, R, L centers. First, make two
        opposite centers (this is quite easy). Then for the two last, first
        solve the center-corners : using this algorithm of mine : (FBL BDR) :
        Uu2 R2 Uu F2 r2 F2 Uu' R2 Uu2 Then solve the center-edges using this
        already known alg : (FR BR) : r2 U2 r2 Uu2 r2 Uu2 2nd step : make the
        FR, FL, BR, BL edges. For this step, I turn the cube to have these four
        edges on the M slice. First, I make two half pairs, by using r/r2 (which
        solve a half pair in UF) U2 B2 U2 B2 r'/r2. To complete these 2 pairs, I
        use a 3 cycle : (UFR DFR DBR) : U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr' U2
        Ll U2 Rr' U2 Rr U2 F2 Rr F2 Ll' Rr2 U2 Then for the last two pairs, I
        use a combination of : (UFL UBL) : Rr2 U2 Ll U2 Rr' U2 Rr U2 F2 Rr F2
        Ll' Rr2 (UFL UFR) : Rr2 B2 U2 Ll U2 Rr' U2 Rr U2 F2 Rr F2 Ll' B2 Rr2 3rd
        step : make the U and D centers. This is easy ! 4th step : make the U
        and D edges. This is quite easy if you know how to solve 4x4 edges, you
        just have to use half turns (like Rr2 U R2 U' Rr2). For the last two
        edges, you may need this alg (thanks to Matyas): (UFL UBR) (UFR UBL) :
        Rr2 Ff2 U2 r2 U2 Ff2 Rr2 5th step : solve the U and D layers Now this is
        a domino solve, I personally solve the bottom layer, fix the parity
        (using R2 U2 R2 U2 R2), then I use T perms with setup moves to finish
        the top layer : (UL UR) (UBL UFL) : R2 U' R2 U R2 y R2 U R2 U' R2 D 6th
        step : solve the middle layer edges. This can be done easily, I'm so
        lazy I won't explain this :) That's it ! Any comments/suggestions ?

        Ok, well, I only saw one of these problems yesterday (the not asking

        The problem with that is that most competitors do NOT know the WCA
        regulations very well. I found myself rereading them today, after
        realizing I didn't know anything about the two-tile rule. Especially
        since many casual cubers competing for the first time don't even know
        there IS a world cubing association, or official written rules, I think
        that is impractical. Oh, and one other thing: Caltech fall DID have
        enough judges by the end. A few of us volunteered to help. There was no
        problem finding willing judges. --- In

        problem with that is that most competitors do NOT know the WCA
        regulations very well. I found myself rereading them today, after
        realizing I didn't know anything about the two-tile rule. Especially
        since many casual cubers competing for the first time don't even know
        there IS a world cubing association, or official written rules, I think
        that is impractical. Oh, and one other thing: Caltech fall DID have
        enough judges by the end. A few of us volunteered to help. There was no
        problem finding willing judges. --- In

        Competition Judges &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, well, I only saw one of these
        problems yesterday (the not asking &gt; before removing cube cover) but
        I can explain the problem. &gt; &gt; At Caltech fall, at least, there
        were not enough judges at first. Two &gt; (or three, I'm not completely
        sure) who had never judged or been &gt; taught how were helping to judge
        competitors. I think the main thing &gt; is just to make sure to pick
        experienced cubers as judges, which will &gt; stop the more major
        problems (DNFs as +2's, OH inspection). &gt; &gt; At the end of the day,
        if you are competing and your judge is doing &gt; something that is
        incorrect, tell them. If they start to remove the &gt; cover, tell them
        you're not ready. Some cubers may not want to call &gt; their own solve
        a DNF, but most are pretty honest. There are a lot of &gt; new cubers in
        competition nowadays, and judging as well. Just try to &gt; catch those
        things when you see them. &gt; &gt; --- In

        the solve with wrists/arms (A6c) &gt; &gt; - Judges do not ask "OK?",
        i.e. uncovering cube at their own &gt; &gt; discretion (A4c, A4d) &gt;
        &gt; - Judges not knowing that OH solves are to be inspected with one

        Thanks, I didn't know about the 26 quarter turns position: In 1998
        Michael Reid found a new position requiring more than 24 quarter turns

        Inexperienced judges at Caltech were probably nothing like those at
        Pleasantville, I am quite sure that two of our judges at Pleasantville
        were younger than the age of 10 years! Regarding them, one 'raced' 2x2x2
        against the Pyraminx competitors, and the other just was incapable of
        being a good judge. The former didn't pay attention to the competitor,
        and the latter just missed simple things like covering the cube (and
        instead of using the score card, ran to the scrambling table to get a
        cover). They were nice and all, but there should be some discretion when
        accepting volunteer judges. Also, most of the judges at Pleasantville
        were parents. They did a very good job for the most part, but they just
        didn't know some of the rules (listed above). I think in all future
        competitions, there should be something for all judges before the
        competition to teach them some of the procedures and rules. I'm not
        trying to bash the Pleasantville competition; I think it was a very good
        competition, except for this one aspect. Also, I think everyone
        appreciated the enthusiasm that all the judges there had, but there was
        just a lack of knowledge of the rules by the judges, there and also at
        Caltech (from what I hear), that I think it is problematic. Jon Choi ---

        Judges &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, well, I only saw one of these
        problems yesterday (the not asking &gt; &gt; before removing cube cover)
        but I can explain the problem. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At Caltech fall, at
        least, there were not enough judges at first. Two &gt; &gt; (or three,
        I'm not completely sure) who had never judged or been &gt; &gt; taught
        how were helping to judge competitors. I think the main thing &gt; &gt;
        is just to make sure to pick experienced cubers as judges, which will
        &gt; &gt; stop the more major problems (DNFs as +2's, OH inspection).
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end of the day, if you are competing and your
        judge is doing &gt; &gt; something that is incorrect, tell them. If they
        start to remove the &gt; &gt; cover, tell them you're not ready. Some
        cubers may not want to call &gt; &gt; their own solve a DNF, but most
        are pretty honest. There are a lot of &gt; &gt; new cubers in
        competition nowadays, and judging as well. Just try to &gt; &gt; catch
        those things when you see them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        regarding &gt; &gt; &gt; DNFs and +2 solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Some things I noticed: &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges pulling the cube
        cover when lifting it, resulting in the cube &gt; &gt; &gt; moving away
        from competitor, while competitor goes to pick up the cube &gt; &gt;
        &gt; (A3e1?) &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges calling DNFs as +2's and vice versa
        (10f) &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges not calling +2's for ending the solve with
        wrists/arms (A6c) &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges do not ask "OK?", i.e.
        uncovering cube at their own &gt; &gt; &gt; discretion (A4c, A4d) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; - Judges not knowing that OH solves are to be inspected with
        one hand &gt; &gt; &gt; (C1a) &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges not knowing the
        two-tile Magic DNF rule (10g) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't there
        be a standard for teaching judges how to judge before a &gt; &gt; &gt;
        competition? I imagine people complaining about more work, but &gt; &gt;
        &gt; compared to the rest of the work involved in organizing a
        competition, &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it's worth it. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        [important] rules here and there, mostly regarding &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        DNFs and +2 solves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some things
        I noticed: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges pulling the cube cover when
        lifting it, resulting in &gt; the cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moving away
        from competitor, while competitor goes to pick up &gt; the cube &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (A3e1?) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges calling DNFs as +2's
        and vice versa (10f) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges not calling +2's for
        ending the solve with wrists/arms &gt; (A6c) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -
        Judges do not ask "OK?", i.e. uncovering cube at their own &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; discretion (A4c, A4d) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges not knowing
        that OH solves are to be inspected with one &gt; hand &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; (C1a) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Judges not knowing the two-tile Magic
        DNF rule (10g) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't there be a
        standard for teaching judges how to judge before a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        competition? I imagine people complaining about more work, but &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; compared to the rest of the work involved in organizing a &gt;
        competition, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it's worth it. &gt; &gt;

        Inexperienced judges at Caltech were probably nothing like those at &gt;
        &gt; Pleasantville, I am quite sure that two of our judges at
        Pleasantville &gt; &gt; were younger than the age of 10 years! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Regarding them, one 'raced' 2x2x2 against the Pyraminx
        competitors, &gt; &gt; and the other just was incapable of being a good
        judge. The former &gt; &gt; didn't pay attention to the competitor, and
        the latter just missed &gt; &gt; simple things like covering the cube
        (and instead of using the score &gt; &gt; card, ran to the scrambling
        table to get a cover). They were nice and &gt; &gt; all, but there
        should be some discretion when accepting volunteer judges. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Also, most of the judges at Pleasantville were parents. They
        did a &gt; &gt; very good job for the most part, but they just didn't
        know some of the &gt; &gt; rules (listed above). I think in all future
        competitions, there should &gt; &gt; be something for all judges before
        the competition to teach them some &gt; &gt; of the procedures and
        rules. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not trying to bash the Pleasantville
        competition; I think it was a &gt; &gt; very good competition, except
        for this one aspect. Also, I think &gt; &gt; everyone appreciated the
        enthusiasm that all the judges there had, but &gt; &gt; there was just a
        lack of knowledge of the rules by the judges, there &gt; &gt; and also
        at Caltech (from what I hear), that I think it is problematic. &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, well, I only saw one of
        these problems yesterday (the not asking &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before
        removing cube cover) but I can explain the problem. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At Caltech fall, at least, there were not enough
        judges at first. Two &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (or three, I'm not completely
        sure) who had never judged or been &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taught how were
        helping to judge competitors. I think the main thing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        is just to make sure to pick experienced cubers as judges, which will
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stop the more major problems (DNFs as +2's, OH
        inspection). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end of the
        day, if you are competing and your judge is doing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        something that is incorrect, tell them. If they start to remove the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cover, tell them you're not ready. Some cubers may not
        want to call &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own solve a DNF, but most are
        pretty honest. There are a lot of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new cubers in
        competition nowadays, and judging as well. Just try to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; catch those things when you see them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Actually, I think that the Caltech competitions work a little better
        because you have Tyson, Leyan, Dan, Chris, etc. judging. I would've
        gladly volunteered to judge, but I was competing in all of the events.
        What Tim should've done was have a couple of people go first, and then
        have them judge, like Tyson does. It's a relatively simple solution, as

        Hi you all, I've already know Stefan's old BLD method, so I decided to
        learn the M2/R2. I love it, I fully understand it and I've already know
        it's algorithms. The question is the next: In my old method I memorized
        the edges first, then corners, then solve corners, parity, and edges.
        This is good for me, because I have words for edges (and building
        sentences during memorization), but corners only a letter: 1, A, 10 is
        the first corner (depend on its orientation) 2, B, 20 is the second,
        etc. so, the corners' memo is pretty fast and solving right after that
        is also fast, without hesitation and thinking, just do the letter's
        algorithm. (1 = UFR, A = FUR, 10 = RUF, 2 = UFL, etc) But M2/R2 if I see
        it well, it's prefered to solve the edges first (at least in Stefan's
        examples). I know I could start with corners, just like before, but in
        this case, if I have parity, I have to do an R2 move between solving
        corners and edges, and the last parity algo is also different (r2 U' r2
        etc -&gt; M2 U' r2 etc) So, what do you recommend for the memorization
        and solving order for M2/R2? Thanks. Have a popfree lucky case! Norbert

        Actually, if you're using R2, then it doesn't matter what you start
        with. The parity fix that Stefan uses fixes centers while fixing the R
        edges. If you do use corners first, just make sure that you put the
        edges back to what they were initially before soling the edges. Then, at
        the end of you're solve, you have to do an R2 before doing the parity
        fix. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Norbert Hantos"

        I've noticed too that many competitors don't know the WCA rules. Some of
        them may just be Rubik's enthusiasts and not even know how to use a
        Stackmat timer. You can't have these people judging. You can always pull
        competitors to do judging, but some competitors may not like that. Some
        people practice constantly between their solves. While it's still good
        according to the rules, people may not like the competition. At the
        Minnesota Open, we had a few non-cubers who were judging. They did a
        pretty good job for the most part, but you could tell they weren't
        experienced. We did have some experienced people, but they were needed
        for scrambling. What I would suggest is that if you're going to a
        competition, tell the organizer in advance if you'll be able to judge or
        scramble. While they could always draft you in an emergency, they'll be
        glad to take your help. If you're coming with a parent/friend/spouse who
        isn't cubing, teach them how to judge before you go and let the
        organizer know you're bringing someone who can help.

        Chris, You might get more response related to this mail in

        that I've had a chance to look at this problem I don't think there are
        any solutions to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 7 where x is a complex number
        (a + bi). If you let x be a complex number then 3^x + 4^x = 7 turns into
        3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln(4))) In
        order for this to be a solution I want to get rid of the terms involving
        the sin() function and the i. But to do this I would need a real number
        b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi while simultaneously
        b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple of 2*pi. There is the trivial case
        where b=0 but then the value of x isn't really a complex number. Am I
        right in my reasoning that there is no solution to this equation among
        the complex numbers, or is there an error in my reasoning here? I am
        assuming that because the exponential functions 3^x and 4^x are
        one-to-one that there is only 1 real number such that 3^x + 4^x = 7 and
        therefore any potential complex number solution must use this somehow.

        question that one of the other math tutors asked me at the &gt; math

        the following equation &gt; algebraically? &gt; &gt; 3^x + 4^x = 7 &gt;
        &gt; What I mean by this is can you solve this simply by manipulating
        the &gt; equation, or converting it to an equivalent problem in another
        branch &gt; of mathematics (elliptic curves maybe?) and thereby derive
        the answer &gt; x=1? Our tutor, who studies at University, asked his
        professor and the &gt; professor said you would most likely need to
        solve it using numerical &gt; methods, or with a calculator or computer.
        &gt; &gt; This also leads into the question of how many solutions are
        there to &gt; the above equation if you allow x to be a real number, or
        if you allow &gt; x to be a complex number? &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; Chris

        I only brought the issue up because I have heard that these incidents
        occurred at Caltech as well, and therefore is not specific to a
        particular competition. However, there is a problem when neither judge
        or competitor knows the pertinent rules. From what I have seen, the more
        experienced cubers don't watch other competitors unless they are friends
        or notoriously good (i.e. very experienced cubers). Therefore, it would
        be difficult to catch some incidents, due to a lack of knowledge of the
        rules. Also, from the competitor's standpoint, would you not think that
        it would be awkward to talk about a judge where he or she would be able
        to hear you? I did try to help the younger judges as they needed, but in
        retrospect, I feel that they did a better job than some of the older
        judges! Jon Choi --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Bob

        guess it's Rowe they're talking about, but...hmm. Rowe, did you steal

        Yes, that's true, though Rowe was most certainly in the library, while
        Sam probably wasn't. I don't really make much of this, I mean, if the
        police took this seriously they would have actually come in and maybe
        gone into the library, where they would have found Rowe wearing blue
        jeans and a black hat and they could have talked to him. Seeing as they
        don't do anything about it until publishing it in the police blotter in
        a newspaper over a week later, I don't think this was actually anything
        that matters. Tim --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I think the person that called the cops was jealous that he couldn't

        if you can't win one on ebay, i suggest making one yourself: my friend
        and i made one by peeling all the stickers off of a cube and gluing on
        washers, sandpaper, small thin hex nuts, etching in crosses, drilling
        holes for each side (the last side was blank). It's a bit hack, but i'm
        sure you could make a nice one with a little bit of time. Good luck!

        "Criticizing is often done "in secret", praising is often done in

        things are. If you think about that for a little, why is voting mostly

        Voting is done in secret so that you can't be intimidated to vote one
        way or another. You don't necessarily have to bring it up with the
        offending judge. I would encourage anyone who notices something to let
        me know about it immediately. Otherwise, how are we to improve? On Nov

        If you look at the "two at once method" at

        &gt; &gt; seem to pull it off, and I need to finish up with the two

        Is anyone using "three pairs at once" method? &gt; &gt; Can you be fast
        solving the cube this way? Also, is there a good way &gt; &gt; to keep
        it going? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using 6-pairs at once. first slice is
        the first 3 pairs, and when &gt; you return the slice you pair up
        another 3, so total of 6 pairs &gt;

        That is essentially it. It's different to tell a judge while he/she is
        judging, or immediately after the solve, but when the judge is
        significantly older than you are, it is hard to imagine that he/she
        would take you seriously. Moreover, it is insulting to talk about
        someone else behind his or her back, especially within earshot. But that
        is an issue of personal beliefs; some people would feel bad about

        I know how intense a competition is for a person show shares his time
        between being an official and being a competitior since I have been
        organising quite a few competitions. A lot depends on volunteering
        judges and that experienced competitors take the responsibility to help
        inexperienced judges. The key issue is how the WCA reacts on all these
        incidents. What is more important: That WCA acknowledges in principle
        all competitions, including those which are run in a joyful,
        "amateurish" and responsible way, or that WCA acknowledges only fewer
        official competitions in which all rules strictly are applied? Bottom

        &gt; I'll keep that in mind for future competitions. I'll take it that
        any &gt; and all judging incidents are to be dealt on an individual
        basis, then? &gt; I'd much rather that you bring up any incident at all
        that might occur. If you tell a judge they're doing something wrong,
        there's a few possibilities: 1) They are a parent or something that's
        not a cuber at all. In that case you're the expert and they're not, and
        they should listen to you. They're just donating their time to help, I
        think they'd probably want to do it right, not mess up the competition.
        2) They are a competitor with a weak knowledge of the WCA regulations.
        This is quite common, and has been the case in a number of east coast
        competitions; I remember specific instances at Captains Cove, Rutgers
        Spring 07, and Pleasantville. They are doing what they can to help out,
        but as competitors, they really should know the rules, and as judges,
        they really really should know the rules. So I don't think that's a
        problem. 3) They are a competitor who thinks they know exactly what
        they're doing but don't, in which case you need to tell them to stop
        them making more mistakes. They're a peer; whether they're faster or
        slower or the same, they're still your peer and should listen to you. If
        a judge makes a mistake, then tell them. If you don't tell them or the
        organizer then the judge will make the same mistake over and over again.
        If I were a judge and I made a mistake on my first competitor and they
        politely corrected me, I'd have no problem with it. If I go the whole
        day messing up every time before being told I'm making a mistake, I'd
        feel terrible. So as soon as you see a mistake, especially if you know
        the regulations really well, let them know. And tell the organizer and
        Delegate too, especially if you see a mistake happening repeatedly. If
        the same mistakes are being made over and over, they need to address it
        publicly, otherwise the competition could just fail miserably from a lot
        of invalid solves and things like that. One problem I had at
        Pleasantville is that I was unaware of most of the judge problems that
        occurred until people started complaining online in the week after.
        There was absolutely nothing I could have done when I didn't know there
        was a problem, and I can't go back in time and tell the judges what
        they're doing wrong. So, please, at least tell the judges when they are
        doing something wrong, and if you feel you need to, tell the organizing
        team/person. Tim

        OK, so my dad got some more information on this, and while I probably
        shouldn't reveal anything more than what was printed, we're now entirely
        sure that Rowe was not the person they thought stole whatever it was, or
        anyone else at the competition for that matter. Furthermore, the police
        report says the man was seen shortly after walking away from the church.
        So that's why the police didn't go in the building, because the guy had
        been seen outside the church. Okay. So neither Rowe nor Sam is wanted by
        the Pleasantville Police Department, nor is anyone else at the

        Nov. 3: A resident of Bedford Road reported at 2:42 p.m. that he &gt;

        description. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure what

        &gt; &gt; &gt; you steal anything? I doubt it as you were in that room

        then they should be told immediately. If I'm a judge and make a mistake,
        I want to know. A suggestion for competitions: I've always known the
        rules fairly well, but sometimes even I was unsure about a detail. But I
        didn't have the rules with me so I couldn't read them. Every competition
        should have the rules printed out and hanging somewhere where everybody
        can easily find them. Actually this should be a requirement written

        That only works well if you also travel around the world to competitions
        like you and I seem to do. I have met a lot of cubers that already knew
        me, but I had no idea who they were. The inverse has also happened. I
        didn't recognize Macky at worlds because I had never seen his picture
        anywhere. Nicknames on fora even complecate the matter more. ExoCorsair
        turned out to be Jon Choi, Masterofthebass turned out to be Dan Cohen.

        Is anyone using "three pairs at once" method? &gt; &gt; Can you be fast
        solving the cube this way? Also, is there a good way &gt; &gt; to keep
        it going? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using 6-pairs at once. first slice is
        the first 3 pairs, and when &gt; you return the slice you pair up

        I don't know your numbering scheme, but for UBR, UFL, DFR just do
        something like D L' to put all three corners on one layer, then orient
        them as you usually do. You don't need to preserve orientation when

        It is relatively easy to come up with a good project on cubing: Here are
        some scribbles from a while ago.

        Personally, I think it is a great idea. You need come up with a way to
        demonstrate the scientific method. Good luck with it. On Nov 16, 2007

        &gt; &gt; This sounds very dead-end-ish to me. It might do for a 50 &gt;

        club or a mini-lecture in computer &gt; &gt; &gt; science, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; but as a science fair you can't do much on it. I've found that
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; general science fair judge is not
        terribly keen &gt; on "computational &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sciences",
        which is technically the category this would fall &gt; &gt; under. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it's not too late, come up with

        good and my science teacher likes the idea. Right now I'm just

        I really don't believe there is a 'fastest method'; assuming the method
        is reachable within the human brain capacity. God's algorithm, the
        shortest way to solve any state of the cube, would be the fastest. Of
        course, and that is physically impossible. If you are talking about the
        common speedcubing methods, it really boils down to who the user is. If
        that person practices alot, he/she would get faster. Corwin --- In

        My computer is too slow and I need it for other stuff now anyway. So
        here are my two new ideas, maybe someone else wants to try them: Orient
        all edges and solve DF and DB with R' F' B' U F2 (can be executed as y
        F' L' R' U L2) and then solve the rest in &lt;L,U,R&gt;, for which
        ACube's input is this: 430 DR UF UR BR DF FL DB UL DL FR UB BL BUR RFD
        BLU FRU DBR BDL LFU FLD Solve the DBL 2x2x2 with L2 F' L R' B' and the
        solve the rest in &lt;U,R,F&gt;, for which ACube's input is this: 510 LF

        rather ignorant and insulting. Oh well, whatever. It's not like
        Wikipedia is where cubers look for information about cubing. Kinda like
        the Guiness book.

        a rubik cube (especially if one is simply following instructions

        someone who holds a world's record for speed cubing. The cube actually
        has mathematical depth and it is disappointing to see someone who seems
        almost certain to be without any mathematical sophistication casting
        aspersions on activities associated with it.

        At times I'm big into contributing to Wikipedia. I would not delete such
        a page if it were me. I would recommend putting it back up and seeing
        what happens as Pat said. However I do see why a person would want to
        delete it, and I wouldn't asssume jealousy or bad intenions. I don't
        think it would be an interesting page to have there though, unless it's
        more than a few sentances long. As it was, it barely qualifies as a
        "stub", and stubs shouldn't exist for too long. Either someone else
        needs to add a lot more to it, or after a certain period of time it
        needs to be deleted once again. The deletion-cycle is part of everyday
        Wikipedia... survival of the fittest articles! btw... if there is any
        hint that the page was put up by Erik himself, it certainly should be
        killed, as that violates the policy. In addtion, if it was all
        first-hand research then it should also be deleted. Be unbiased, and
        place the proper references and you'll have a better chance pal. -Doug

        Hi everyone, I need your help. Does anyone of you ever heard of a man
        called Melquiades Herrera (or Hilario Becerril, he used to hold both
        names) I heard this man, in the eighties or early nineties, found a way
        to solve the cube which was faster. I even heard he received a letter
        from the company telling to him that, in fact, he did found a quicker
        way to solve it. The point is that this man was one of the most
        interesting and intringuing performance/conceptual artists in mexico, he
        even was called "The Mexican Duchamp". Saddly, after his death in 2003,
        there is practically no information about him or his work. He was able
        to solve very complex mathematical problems and, at the same time, to
        debate about art and aesthetics, sometimes using banal objects to make
        demonstrations (he even developed, in 26 typed letter size paper sheets,
        a color theory considering a fourth quality: dimension). Anyway, if
        somebody ever heard of him or knows something about his solving thing,
        please tell me (I also heard, from teachers who knew him, that he framed
        the Rubiks letter he received). His name is Melquiades Herrera or
        Hilario Becerril (thats yhe name he used to wear when writing articles).
        Please contact me here or trough my personal e-mail: stupid_mop@...
        Thank everyone. peace. Roberto

        the company telling to him that, in fact, he did found a &gt; quicker
        way to solve it. The point is that this man was one of the &gt; most
        interesting and intringuing performance/conceptual artists in &gt;
        mexico, he even was called "The Mexican Duchamp". Saddly, after his &gt;
        death in 2003, there is practically no information about him or his &gt;
        work. He was able to solve very complex mathematical problems and, at
        &gt; the same time, to debate about art and aesthetics, sometimes using
        &gt; banal objects to make demonstrations (he even developed, in 26
        typed &gt; letter size paper sheets, a color theory considering a fourth
        &gt; quality: dimension). &gt; Anyway, if somebody ever heard of him or
        knows something about his &gt; solving thing, please tell me (I also
        heard, from teachers who knew &gt; him, that he framed the Rubiks letter
        he received). His name is &gt; Melquiades Herrera or Hilario Becerril
        (thats yhe name he used to &gt; wear when writing articles). Please
        contact me here or trough my &gt; personal e-mail: stupid_mop@... &gt;
        Thank everyone. peace. Roberto &gt;

        Would those that are misquoted and referred to in this article please
        speak with the author? From a raw writing standpoint, this thing is
        barely readable. The English level here resembles something very similar
        to what ended up in the toilet after a nasty losing battle with food
        poisoning. I actually read this article earlier, but I was so confused,
        that I thought I was simply tired and would examine it in the morning.
        Maybe I misunderstood the 20 second memorization of the 5x5x5 cube...
        But there are several things that need to happen here. 1. The newspaper
        needs to be informed that this article, ignoring all the facts, is a
        piece of junk. 2. The people who the article refers to need to let Wendy
        know that she butchered everything. 3. The people who were in this
        article need to be very careful when giving interviews. As much as I'd
        like to blame Wendy Solomon for this, as practitioners of this sport, we
        are responsible for being absolutely clear in explaining what we do. Be
        prepared for the same dumb questions. Be prepared for the same
        uneducated responses. If you've talked to someone who doesn't clear, you
        can pretty much predict with accuracy that rivals quantum theory what
        the next response will be. So, please... take responsibility. Be careful
        in your explanations, be alert for possible misinterpretations, and
        understand that sometimes people aren't as smart as you are.

        Hi :-) I do not see any reason for being so upset about this article.
        Apart from getting many facts wrong i think it is actually well written.
        One cannot expect a newspaper to get an article like this correct wrt
        all the facts. This article is off putting only to those already
        actively cubing and watching the community closely i guess. For those
        still only half interested i think this article may actually be
        inspiring for some. What is the purpose of a newspaper article about
        cubing? Getting all the facts correct? That's an illusion!! Enjoy!! -Per

        Just some ideas: I didn't require it but only asked for it, maybe people
        don't like to be forced but welcome an offer. Also, I emphasized it's

        &gt; Would those that are misquoted and referred to in this article
        please &gt; speak with the author? From a raw writing standpoint, this
        thing is &gt; barely readable. The English level here resembles
        something very &gt; similar to what ended up in the toilet after a nasty
        losing battle &gt; with food poisoning. &gt; &gt; I actually read this
        article earlier, but I was so confused, that I &gt; thought I was simply
        tired and would examine it in the morning. Maybe &gt; I misunderstood
        the 20 second memorization of the 5x5x5 cube... &gt; &gt; But there are
        several things that need to happen here. &gt; &gt; 1. The newspaper
        needs to be informed that this article, ignoring all &gt; the facts, is
        a piece of junk. &gt; 2. The people who the article refers to need to
        let Wendy know that &gt; she butchered everything. &gt; 3. The people
        who were in this article need to be very careful when &gt; giving
        interviews. &gt; &gt; As much as I'd like to blame Wendy Solomon for
        this, as practitioners &gt; of this sport, we are responsible for being
        absolutely clear in &gt; explaining what we do. Be prepared for the same
        dumb questions. Be &gt; prepared for the same uneducated responses. If
        you've talked to &gt; someone who doesn't clear, you can pretty much
        predict with accuracy &gt; that rivals quantum theory what the next
        response will be. &gt; &gt; So, please... take responsibility. Be
        careful in your explanations, &gt; be alert for possible
        misinterpretations, and understand that &gt; sometimes people aren't as
        smart as you are. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message

        I just got may "Icon Edition" cube from Barnes &amp; Noble. It is very
        very cool!! I'm not worried about the stickers because I don't plan on
        opening it. You would be crazy to actually use this cube. The cool thing
        about it is the box and the stickers!, otherwise it is the same cube you

        beginning.... Why was I so stubborn??? ;-) Although I am upset that some
        people will now think it's possible to memorize for 5x5 BLD in 20
        seconds, I do think the overall message of the article to people who
        know nothing about cubing is positive (which is good). One other good
        thing is that intermediate and beginning cubers who read this article
        may be inspired to avoid the mistakes of us older cubers by actually
        learning all the OFL algs and not skipping over them ;-) Chris

        I agree with Per that this article, while terrible, is not very much
        worse than any of the other articles you see around. The factual errors
        seem to be mostly that she doesn't understand what a 5-by-5 is. In our
        interview I was quite sure that I had explained it to her properly. She
        asked if people also solve the 5x5 blindfolded and I said "Yes, but
        nobody did in Pleasantville." She asked if it was harder and I explained
        that it is since, on the 5x5, you have a lot more pieces to worry about
        since each side has 5 pieces instead of 3. I worded it better than that,
        though since I had already explained the difference to her twice I
        wasn't as clear as I could have been that time. The other errors are
        that Fridrich's name is misspelled, but I don't see that as that big of
        a problem. Dan is then misquoted about the method. Both of these, I
        believe, are related to the fact that the reporter simply does not care.
        During our interview she sounded quite tired of the article, and she
        clearly did not put the full effort into making sure to quote people
        correctly or record spellings properly. I don't think that that is the
        fault of anyone but Wendy. I don't see any other errors, though she
        definitely exaggerated what I said about having heard of Dan before. I
        agree that this is a terrible article, but I think the only major error
        is the 5x5 business. Since I clearly didn't explain it well enough to
        Wendy, Tyson, how would you explain to a non-cuber what a 5x5 cube is?

        that much to be honest. I mean if the interviewer does not care all that
        much about the competition, chances are that some of the facts will get
        messed up in the final product. It sounds to me like everyone was fairly
        clear about explaining the different aspects of cubing. Perhaps she just
        wasn't all that interested, and only wanted to write the article and go
        home. All in all, I think the tone and the presentation of cubing in the
        article is very positive. I agree that many facts are wrong, but I think
        to some extent this is out of our control. Look on the bright side, at
        least interviewers are no longer asking tongue in cheek jokes about
        whether the cube helps you get girls, or how much free time you have on
        your hands. Chris

        Apart from the 5x5 thing, which really made me laugh out loud, I also

        what ended up in the toilet after a nasty losing battle &gt; &gt; &gt;
        with food poisoning. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I actually read this

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I misunderstood the 20 second memorization of the 5x5x5
        cube... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But there are several things that
        need to happen here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The newspaper
        needs to be informed that this article, ignoring &gt; &gt; all &gt; &gt;
        &gt; the facts, is a piece of junk. &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The people who the
        article refers to need to let Wendy know &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt;
        she butchered everything. &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The people who were in this
        article need to be very careful &gt; &gt; when &gt; &gt; &gt; giving
        interviews. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I'd like to blame
        Wendy Solomon for this, as &gt; &gt; practitioners &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        this sport, we are responsible for being absolutely clear in &gt; &gt;
        &gt; explaining what we do. Be prepared for the same dumb questions.
        &gt; &gt; Be &gt; &gt; &gt; prepared for the same uneducated responses.
        If you've talked to &gt; &gt; &gt; someone who doesn't clear, you can
        pretty much predict with &gt; &gt; accuracy &gt; &gt; &gt; that rivals
        quantum theory what the next response will be. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So, please... take responsibility. Be careful in your &gt; &gt;
        explanations, &gt; &gt; &gt; be alert for possible misinterpretations,
        and understand that &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes people aren't as smart as
        you are. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi all, I was getting tired of trying to use my spacebar, or a stopwatch
        for timing myself, and I didn't have any money to buy a stack-mat thing.
        So, I built myself a timer with stuff I had lying around. It's just
        based around a stopwatch, a transistor, a resistor, and some nice
        quarter-inch brass plates, all mounted on a piece of black particle
        board I found in the trash. The plates were "polished" with my Dremel,
        using the sanding disks, giving them a nice shiny spiral pattern. The
        triggering on the plates is sensitive enough to pick up the loop of
        several people in a circuit, hand-in hand, but it does not false
        trigger. The only real difference I found between my timer, and a
        stack-mat timer, is that the start/stop is TAP activated, rather than
        release &gt; start, replace &gt; stop. But I don't mind it. picture

        well since everyone is weighing in, i will say that this article is
        crap. ethical journalism requires a unwavering attention to fact and
        detail, regardless of personal interest in the story. there were
        numerous factual errors, and general ignorance regarding details that
        could have easily been resolved with a couple google searches or a
        little bit of pride in one's work. for example &gt;&gt;Dan Cohen, 18,
        ranked 13th in the world and second in North America for a
        &gt;&gt;single solve (1:54.32 minutes) and the 12th in the world for
        best average time &gt;&gt;(2:03.83) nothing is mentioned to transfer
        from 3x3 to 5x5 rankings/times, and with a 3x3 bld statment next line,
        it looks as though 3x3 is the topic the whole time &gt;&gt;That's
        cube-speak for a Rubik's Cube with dimensions that measure
        &gt;&gt;5-by-5-by-5 inches i actually did laugh out loud on that
        &gt;&gt;Dan Cohen says his fastest memorization time was 20 seconds for
        the 5-by-5. wow chris hardwick would be quite jealous of that :)
        &gt;&gt; Friedrich method jesus. &gt;&gt;which is called orientation of
        the first layer, or OFL i'm in hell. now while mistakes are bound to
        happen, we should be able to expect that most of these shouldn't happen
        since its just a matter of paying attention and research. we're not
        doing brain surgery, there are plenty of good references for cubers and
        non cubers alike. this was factual slaughter and an extreme case of
        professional negligence. --------------------------------- Be a better

        I laughed upon reading the article, personally. I think I was the only
        one who was directly misquoted in the article. Everything else can be

        first break the rubiks cube in (by playing with it for about a week or
        maybe 2 weeks). after that, lubricate the cube with a 100% silicone

        One alg every two weeks? Have you even tried going faster? I'll bet you
        can learn at least one a day, if you just spend a little time. Just
        remember that it's not your brain that's supposed to learn the alg ...
        it's your fingers. Do it over and over again until it's down pat in your
        fingers. Every day, spend a little time redoing algs from past days, to
        make sure they're still there. Don't be afraid to try to learn faster
        than you think you're able to. Your brain can do some pretty cool things

        I would either explain what a 5x5 square is (easy) or what a 5x5x5 cube
        is by explaining there are different levels of cubes: 2x2x2 has 2x2=4
        pieces on every of its 6 sides for a total of 24 pieces. It is also
        known as "junior cube". 3x3x3 has 3x3=9 pieces on every of its 6 sides
        for a total of 54 pieces. This is often called just "the cube" because
        it is the one everyone knows (and loves/hates). 4x4x4 has 4x4=16 pieces
        on every of its 6 sides for a total of 98 pieces. This is also known as
        "the Revenge". 5x5x5 has 5x5=25 pieces on every of its 6 sides for a
        total of 150 pieces. This is also knows as "the Professor". (and I know
        that names like "the Revenge" are not the official names, but the
        question was how I would explain it). I would also mention the
        time-frame that is needed by a top-cuber to solve these cubes on average
        (in nicely rounded numbers). 5 seconds, 15 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute
        45. (or maybe the best single times as 2.5 seconds, 10 seconds, 45
        seconds, 90 seconds) . On Wed, 21 Nov 2007 19:00:46 -0000, cmhardw

        non-cuber what a &gt; 5x5 cube is? &gt; &gt; Tim I don't think you
        should fault yourself that much to be honest. I mean if the interviewer
        does not care all that much about the competition, chances are that some
        of the facts will get messed up in the final product. It sounds to me
        like everyone was fairly clear about explaining the different aspects of
        cubing. Perhaps she just wasn't all that interested, and only wanted to
        write the article and go home. All in all, I think the tone and the
        presentation of cubing in the article is very positive. I agree that
        many facts are wrong, but I think to some extent this is out of our
        control. Look on the bright side, at least interviewers are no longer
        asking tongue in cheek jokes about whether the cube helps you get girls,
        or how much free time you have on your hands. Chris Links: ------ [1]

        I suppose many of the buyers are fans of the other cubes and other wacky
        shaped puzzles of a Rubik's style. some people who like it may just be

        The VISTA bug is fixed now. There should be no problem to close Cube
        Explorer in version 4.20. The problem was not my code but the help
        system which seems to have changed in VISTA. I still run XP because
        VISTA seems quite slow to me, I installed VISTA in a vmware virtual
        machine for the only purpose to find this bug. Another strange "feature"
        (is this really necessary?) and not a bug in VISTA is that the main
        window of the chm helpfile does not open on default when you have
        downloaded my program and installed it in any directory. VISTA gives a
        not very helpful error message. You explicitly have to allow to open the
        file in the property dialog of the chm file. An operating system which
        annoys the user with permanent security issues because else it seems to
        run insecure has some design flaw from my point of view. Something like
        this is unimaginable in LINUX. Be that as it may, get happy with your
        VISTA and the new version of CE. Ron van Bruchem proposed to build in a
        scrambler according to the WCA competition regulation. You find it under
        the Edit menu. Herbert --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Salut macky, En fait pour etre honnete je n'avais pas assez de
        motivation pour le faire, je pensais qu'avec le bouche √† oreille ceux
        qui voulais des conseils m'auraient demand√©, mais il semblais que je
        restais un "inconnu":D. Apres avoir parl√© √† certains cubeurs √† Budapest
        et sur internet (Dan dzoan, Gungz, Harris chan and the french
        team(edouard, jean and thibaut)), j'ai enfin d√©cid√© de partager toutes
        les connaissances que j'avais acquises avec la methode fridrich, et il
        semble que le nombre de personnes que ca interresse soit plus grand que
        ce que j'imaginais. Merci d'avoir mis un lien de ma page sur la tienne,
        je mettrai ton lien sur la mienne bientot. Pour le F2LL, je ne l'utilise
        pas depuis longtemps avec thibaut, mais cela donne des OLL skips assez
        faciles et des algorithmes en RUL assez faciles(surtout pour le cubing
        One-Handed). Tu oublies le R-OLL!!:D Je pense qu'on peux gagner beaucoup
        de temps en anticipant le type de PLL. Il faudrait que d'autres
        l'utilisent pour donner leur avis car pour l'instant, je crois etre le
        seul a l'utiliser(Edouard fais la methode R-OLL simple pour l'instant).
        Merci pour la correction, je l'ai corrig√© immediatement. Have fun,
        sebastien &gt; Salut S√©bastien, &gt; &gt; Je me suis souvent demand√©
        pourquoi, avec toutes tes id√©es, tu n'avais &gt; pas ton propre site. Je
        l'aime beaucoup. J'ai mis un lien sur le mien. &gt; &gt; Je ne savais
        pas que toi et Thibaut utilisaient F2LL! √áa me donne &gt; finalement
        quelque chose de nouveau √† apprendre (...et multislotting). &gt; &gt;
        Dans le troisi√®me algorithme de la liste, tu as oubli√© une apostrophe:

        Hello all, I recently purchased a cube and can complete it in about 4-5
        minutes. I want to make a speed cube now and I know you need to use
        silicone spray, but my question is how to you take the cube apart? There
        are no instructions on how to take the cube apart in the pamphlet that
        came with the cube. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

        Well hello all, I just found this group and thought I would join =-)
        Also, I have my time down to about 0:55-1:36 on average now, but I would
        like to know if they was a faster way I could start to learn? I usually
        build a white cross on top, put my corners into place, use an algorithum
        to get my edges in the second layer correct, then make my yellow cross
        on the bottom, fix the 3rd layer edges, then orient corners, then make
        them face the right way. I notice that about 30 seconds of my time is
        generally spent building the first layer. Any suggestions would be
        grand. I'm also looking forward to receiving my package from China soon;
        I have ordered a set of 2x2, 4x4, and 5x5 East Sheen cubes, should
        provide a new challenge for me =-)

        &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I finally
        uploaded my new website specialized in the Fridrich method. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; It contains tips for F2L like Multislotting, ZBF2L &amp; F2LL.
        It also &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contains all my algorithm for OLL and PLL,
        One-Handed or Two-Handed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have
        fun and enjoy it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://perso.
        orange.fr/ absolutemind &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS:The
        multislotting section is still under construction, I need the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; help of experimented cubers to achieve it. Email me if you're
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested at zemalinou@gmail. com &gt; &gt; &gt;

        The way I learned was I wasted my time memorizing algorithms for F2L.
        Later, I realized on my own that it was based on intuition. So then, I
        studied the F2L cases and tried to solve them based on intuition. The
        "pair and insert" technique, I found out on my own and other techniques
        i.e. multislotting, utilizing empty slots on my own and later read about
        it on Dan Harris' website and other speedcubing website (hey, thats a
        run-on sentence). In other words, its not that hard to figure out F2L
        based on intuition. It's actually better than memorizing algorithms. So
        learn from my mistake: do not memorize algorithms. Try to figure out F2L
        on your own. Brian ----- Original Message ---- From: kemp_drumsalot

        Hi there! I have just started cubing just about 2 - 3 weeks ago. I first
        learned using the beginners method... then I learned the Petrus method.
        Right now I average about 1:05 using the Petrus method. I also learned
        how to do the F2L using the Fridrich method. Using the Fridrich method,
        I average 1:30. I've heard some people say that it's much easier to
        speedcube using the Fridrich method than the Petrus method, but for me
        I'm better at the Petrus method. Should I change and practice more often
        on the Fridrich method? PS As a sort of side question... One of the
        reasons I don't like the Fridrich method is because you have to orient
        the edges after you do the F2L wherein the Petrus method you don't. Is
        there any way to orient the edges while I place the corners?

        not that hard to figure out F2L based on intuition. It's actually better
        than memorizing algorithms. So learn from my mistake: do not memorize
        algorithms. Try to figure out F2L on your own. &gt; &gt; Brian &gt; &gt;

        you shouldn't switch just because some people like Fridrich. It's about
        personal preference, some find Petrus easier/more fun. &gt; One of the
        reasons I don't like the Fridrich method is because &gt; you have to

        corners? It is possible to orient edges before LL, for example you could
        do it before/while solving the cross. But the Petrus way is more
        natural. Fixing bad edges is an important part of the method, not an
        add-on. -- Johannes Laire

        Being Dan Cohen, I think that I was most directly misquoted. Maybe Tim's
        5x5 in 20s comment could be the worst, but I was the entire first half
        of the article. I'll go through each quote and pick apart what she did
        wrong. "''It's really all about the visual,'' Dan Cohen says" This was,
        I think, in response to a question about how you get so fast. I
        responded saying something to the effect that lookahead was important
        and being fast required good visual skills. "'I know the algorithms. I
        memorize a sequence of pieces and then solve pretty much one piece at a
        time,'' Dan says. He's memorized 180 sequences so far." I told her that
        I've memorized 180 sequences for every cube that I can solve. I did say
        that I know a couple of algorithms for BLD. The OFL comment, was just
        her not hearing me on the phone. I definitely didn't say that OFL came
        after F2L... The spelling of Fridrich's name was also a problem of the
        phone connection. All in all, the article isn't as bad as I think that
        most of you are making it out to be. I think that the article, while
        providing some innacurate facts, did put a good light on speedcubing for
        the layperson. I do think I asked her if I could proofread it and I just
        never got an answer to that. If I didn't, I should've, that's my
        mistake. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Jon Choi"

        much predict with accuracy &gt; &gt; that rivals quantum theory what the
        next response will be. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, please... take

        step you can say and has got "only" 32 cases. The algs for VHF2L are the
        same as the algs for ZBF2L where the pair is built already. So you will

        Thank you Herbert. I can confirm the Vista-bug is indeed fixed. Thanks
        for all the work you have put into this program. I really enjoy it and
        use it often. I want to ask you for one feature one final time. If you
        still disagree with me I will not bother you about this anymore. Could
        you make the webserver able to accept all parameters that are mentioned
        under "options, two phase algorithm" and add a way for it to return
        optimal solves (preferably also using "huge optimal solver"). I know
        that you created the webserver with the idea that it is only useful for
        robots that need an "almost" optimal solution within a very limited
        timeframe. I would like to use it on a webpage that will be accesible by
        everyone so more people can enjoy your program without the need for
        Windows (and lots of memory). This is also useful for reducing a (45
        move) Fewest Moves scramble to an optimal solution and for testing the
        "20 moves maximum" limit with another program I wrote that interfaces
        with the webserver. I hope you reconsider and make the webserver more
        powerful, Arnaud ----- Original Message ----- From: h_kociemba To:

        The VISTA bug is fixed now. There should be no problem to close Cube
        Explorer in version 4.20. The problem was not my code but the help
        system which seems to have changed in VISTA. I still run XP because
        VISTA seems quite slow to me, I installed VISTA in a vmware virtual
        machine for the only purpose to find this bug. Another strange "feature"
        (is this really necessary?) and not a bug in VISTA is that the main
        window of the chm helpfile does not open on default when you have
        downloaded my program and installed it in any directory. VISTA gives a
        not very helpful error message. You explicitly have to allow to open the
        file in the property dialog of the chm file. An operating system which
        annoys the user with permanent security issues because else it seems to
        run insecure has some design flaw from my point of view. Something like
        this is unimaginable in LINUX. Be that as it may, get happy with your
        VISTA and the new version of CE. Ron van Bruchem proposed to build in a
        scrambler according to the WCA competition regulation. You find it under
        the Edit menu. Herbert --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Herbert, do you use cutting of the tree or do does the program goes
        through all possible set of turns? Otherwise, I thought about a few nice
        ways to see if it's possible to reach a solution whitin n turns. As for
        an example you can look for edges that are in the correct slice, wrongly
        oriented and not in correct position (FD at UB for example). A peice
        like that is not possible to solve in less than 3 turns and there are
        only four ways to that (I think). IF non of those are the correct
        solution AND ((current_number_of_turns + n) =&gt; max_number_of_turns)
        THEN GOTO you_are_on_the_wrong_way ELSE This_is_good END IF :-) If you
        take two edges in count there are not many solutions for those less than
        maybe 6-7 turns. Take a number of combos like that and set up tables for
        the solutions and it must be possible to save a lot of processing time.
        Is that a good id√©a? (maybe you already know better ways than this? =)

        &gt; Thanks for your input! I'll probably stick with the Petrus method,
        &gt; but &gt; &gt; might look into ZBF2L or the other things you guys
        were talking &gt; about, &gt; &gt; although I probably won't use them
        right now. I want to get better &gt; at &gt; &gt; the Petrus method. :)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think we were
        joking a little with you =) &gt; &gt; ZBF2L are like 400 cases, my XCLL
        i over 300, no way you will learn &gt; that, wery few of the most
        advanced cubers even try to do it, of them &gt; who tries few fullfill
        the learning process. &gt; &gt; But, there is a substitute for ZBF2L =
        VHF2L, it's ZBF2L in two step &gt; you can say and has got "only" 32
        cases. &gt; &gt; The algs for VHF2L are the same as the algs for ZBF2L
        where the pair &gt; is built already. So you will find the VH algs at
        the ZB pages. &gt; Okay. :D When I went to the site, I decided that the
        most important ones would be where the pair was already formed. Anyway,
        thanks again for the reply. :)

        Why on earth are people suggesting ZB/VH F2L for someone who's been
        cubing 3 weeks? VHF2L is completely not necessary to cut down times from
        1:30 to under a minute. Learning 32 algs (well, 16 before reflections,
        but reflections aren't always that intuitive for new cubers) at his
        stage isn't at all necessary or helpful. It cuts down move count by at
        most 3-4 moves on average. Learning a 4-look LL, which is less algs,
        would be far more beneficial. Then saying ZBF2L...I know you were
        joking, but someone who's been cubing 3 weeks wouldn't know. If you told
        me right now I needed to learn ZB to get faster, I would disagree with
        you and keep doing what I'm doing. If you told me that ZB was the only
        way to go four years ago, I might have quit cubing. ZB is ridiculous,
        you really have to want it and be a really good cuber to be able to
        learn ZB and have it be good for you. Chip, pick the method that you
        like the best. If you like how Petrus F2L feels with blockbuilding and
        such, use Petrus. If you like the F2L pairs approach, use Fridrich-like
        methods. At times of 1:30, there's no reason to move onto advanced
        Fridrich-style solutions like VH or ZB. As far as orienting edges goes,
        if it makes a huge difference to you, use Petrus. On average, in
        Fridrich it takes 6 moves to orient edges; I don't think that's too much
        of a problem, but if it matters to you, do Petrus. But don't go into an
        advanced method before you know what you're doing and are completely
        comfortable with what you can do, and don't try VHF2L until you're
        really sure it's what you should do. Learn fingertricks also before
        worrying about getting really good at a method. Tim --- In

        Like Tim said, staying with whatever feels most natural will be more
        beneficial at this point than anything... I'd say don't worry too much
        about many new algorithms (such as COLL for Petrus method) until it
        becomes apparent that sheer move count, or inefficient algs keep you
        from getting faster... With practice, just using fingertricks, training
        your recognition, and being able to look ahead while solving can very
        comfortably get you around 40 seconds on average with Petrus' beginner
        method, maybe even lower (it works out to around the same thing using
        Fridrich F2L too). The most important thing, though, is that you have
        fun while cubing. Hope I could help, Good luck :)

        Ok, well as I have said, I just recieved my 2x2, 4x4, and 5x5 cubes, so
        I have yet to try to solve them yet, but feel free to post your methods
        for them. Also, for my 3x3, I have tried the F2L method, but I have yet
        to completely conquer it at a significant speed, so I still use my solve
        1st, 2nd, then bottom cross, middles, corners, and orient them for
        speed. So any tips there would also be appreciated. Basically, share
        your ways to solve your cubes and give tips for others.

        &gt; Basically, share your ways to solve your cubes and give tips for
        others. &gt; My approach is to use the same method for them all but add
        steps for lager cubes. There is a lot to learn and I have not published
        any method description but I use it myself. All is based on intuition
        and CLL + ELL. For 2x2x2: build first layer and then do CLL For 3x3x3:
        build F2L and then do CLL + ELL ** For 4x4x4: build F3L and then do CLL
        + ELL1/ELL2/ELL3 For 5x5x5: build F4L and then do CLL +
        ELL1/ELL2/ELL3/ELL4 6x, 7x and lager will add more ELL steps but are the
        same otherwise. I got a special and very effective intuitive way to do
        FnL for big cubes (85-90 turns for 4x) but it is pretty complexed and
        hard to describe in short terms, it looks a bit like Roux, building F2B
        at first using a style I call Free Slice First n Layers, also useful for
        3x3x3 = FS-F2L :) All alg for 4x4x4 ELL1, ELL2 and ELL3 is in a thread I
        posted this summer in this mailing list, look at something like "ELL for
        4x4x4" or whatever I named the tread =) // Kenneth ** Here I myself use
        VH/ZB-F2L and COLL-EPLL/ZBLL but COLL is basicly the same as CLL and
        EPLL is a subgroup of ELL so it's the same. Earlier I used CLL+ELL but
        did not like what happen to my LL-edges when they were all oriented and
        I did CLL... So I learned COLL, VH I already knew from my older method.
        I'm also developing a style where you do CLL+EOLL in one and end in
        EPLL, but there is a lot of work, maybe I start to use it later for
        speedsolving)

        all do the same or use different methods for different sizes? (conquered

        going through them, after awhile, switch to a small post it with just
        the few algorithums left that trouble you, and then, you won't need them
        most of the time, so keep it in your pocket, finally, you won't need it
        at all! I should tell you though, I'm not familiar with that method so
        don't take all of my words to heart, I will take a look at them and get

        to you with a homework &gt; "question" when really they just want the
        answer without doing any work to try and figure &gt; out why they can't
        get it. &gt; &gt; Sorry man, I don't think Stefan is being a jerk. &gt;
        &gt; ~John H.~ &gt; Well maybe I should rephrase, I try to figure out
        every cube on my on before I check out the net, when I said "feel free
        to post your methods" All I simply meant was some people use Petrus
        while other use Fredricks, I didn't mean type out every single move you
        do, just the method, for there is alot of ways to solve different cubes,
        and just figured it would be a good chance to talk about them.

        Sure, those are nice collections of physical cubes. My own collection
        includes every possible cube, tetrahedron, and octahedron where the
        number of tiles per edge can be chosen arbitrarily. Of course it is
        software and it doesn't have that nice tactile feel but it is only
        limited by processing power, memory and screen size which all seem to
        increase exponentially with time. [N.B. I have only worked on regular
        tetrahedra, octahedra, and hexahedra (cubes) but will probably add more

        When I learned OLL and PLL I first learned all of the PLLs, and limited
        myself to learning maybe 3 a week just so I could spend a good 2 days to
        get familiar with using each one. During that time I'd the algs over and
        over (usually around 20 times) until they were easy to do with my eyes
        closed... then I just started solving like normal. Just take it at a

        Anyways, I have been told to try using the F2L method, but &gt; I am
        having a lot of trouble and it just doesn't feel very natural, &gt; any
        suggestions? &gt; Why would I mind? :) The way I would recommend
        learning F2L is as follows: Take a page of algs such as
        http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html and figure out how each one works (in the
        link I gave, only worry about the first one listed for each case). Watch
        the pieces move, see how it's broken into a setup phase and a solve
        phase for each algorithm. Many people would tell you to figure out how
        to pair things yourself; I feel like figuring out what's going on is as
        effective, and you end up with good algorithms you understand. An idea
        for learning F2L would be this: first figure out how all of them work.
        Even once you understand them, the cases will be difficult to identify
        and remember at first. So maybe for practicing recognizing at first,
        when you do F2L, look at a pair and think "Oh, that's the third one on
        the second page of my printout" or "Oh, that's number 17 on my printout"
        before looking at how to solve it (but make sure you understand how it
        works each time you do it). I think this would help with recognizing.
        You're pairing the cases up with something (not the algorithm itself
        yet) so they're not just meaningless cases. But numbers are easier to
        learn than algorithms; you already know the numbers, you just have to
        associate them with cases, instead of learning a new alg and what it
        looks like at the same time. Then as you do that, you'll start to find
        that certain cases make a lot of sense and you can do them for memory.
        The rest, look at them again to see how they work and in time you'll get
        them. The better you understand the cases and can do them well, the more
        F2L will make sense to you and feel natural. Tim

        Of course tree cutting is done, and it done up to 13 moves in advance,

        ways to see if it's possible to &gt; reach a solution whitin n turns.
        &gt; &gt; As for an example you can look for edges that are in the
        correct &gt; slice, wrongly oriented and not in correct position (FD at
        UB for &gt; example). &gt; &gt; A peice like that is not possible to

        think). &gt; &gt; IF &gt; non of those are the correct solution AND &gt;

        &gt; &gt; :-) &gt; &gt; If you take two edges in count there are not
        many solutions for those &gt; less than maybe 6-7 turns. Take a number
        of combos like that and set &gt; up tables for the solutions and it must

        Well just from doing one solve.. I would like a "0" count down time. I
        like to inspect for roughly 15 seconds, spacebar, release, and pick up
        right away. Also, I noticed when you delete a time, that time still
        stays on the statistics. I would suggest modifying that so when you
        delete, it deletes off your average and stuff as well. Lastly, it would
        be nice to add a scrambler ;P. Other then those, it's a very nice timer.

        deletes off your average and stuff as well. &gt; Lastly, it would be
        nice to add a scrambler ;P. &gt; Other then those, it's a very nice

        &gt; Here's a new online Rubik's Cube timer you guys might want to have
        a &gt; &gt; look at: &gt; &gt; www.rubiktime.com
        &lt;http://www.rubiktime.com&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timer is clean,
        simple, looks good and works great! The &gt; &gt; particularity of this
        timer is that it let you manage multiple times &gt; &gt; lists and
        stores all your session's statistics. Anyway, have a look and &gt; &gt;

        Thanks for the comments and I totally agree. I'll be adding a 0
        countdown time, it's been requested by most people. For the delete that
        removes the time from statistics, I'll take a different approach which
        is to ask the user if he wants to save the time and if yes it will go in
        statistics and you can't revert it. I'll add that fairly soon because I
        agree, if you recorded a 1 second solve by mistake, you don't want it to
        be in your stats...Unless you can solve it in 1 sec ;) Scrambler's on
        the way too... Ben. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; Hi there, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's a new
        online Rubik's Cube timer you guys might want to have a &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; look at: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www.rubiktime.com
        &lt;http://www.rubiktime.com&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The timer is clean, simple, looks good and works great! The &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; particularity of this timer is that it let you manage multiple
        times &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lists and stores all your session's
        statistics. Anyway, have a &gt; &gt; look and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leave
        your comments! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ben. &gt; &gt;

        One thing I like about this timer (unlike other timers I've seen) is
        that the timer stops when the space bar is pressed *down*. I have
        problems with it, though. The countdown timer doesn't always start when
        I release the space bar. Perhaps there should be an indicator (like the
        green light on a Stackmat) when the timer is ready to be started. Also,
        it sometimes stops displaying the time I just got when I release the
        space bar after stopping the timer. I would suggest you require the
        space bar to be released and pressed again before the time for the solve
        time is cleared (and replaced by the countdown time indicator). Ideally
        I would like some sort of system that allows you to set a 15- second
        countdown timer (with optional audible warning when there is 5 seconds
        remaining), but allows you to start the "real" timer before the
        countdown timer finishes. Perhaps you would be forced to press and
        release the space bar again to start the "real" timer. Else I would just
        use 0 (zero) countdown (if available) time as others have suggested.
        There was a display layout problem with one of two browsers I used
        (IE6). Also, don't use a colon between the seconds and fractions of a
        second. (For the USA, it should be a dot/period.) Anyway, I don't expect
        to really use it much, being it's an *online* timer. - Bruce --- In

        I started with Fridrich and averaged about 1:30, then I discovered
        Petrus and within 2 months I averaged 45s, 1 month later average 31 sec.
        I have not worked on speed very much lately, but I could see averaging
        around 25sec. But generally the fast use Fridrich or modified Fridrich.

        You can really cut down your times for all of them! Every PLL should be
        done in less than 3 seconds (Sub-2 is the aim). Just practise and
        practise and your times should get down. For example, I have been cubing
        for 8 months, and I can do all PLLs in less than 2 seconds (except N's).

        &gt; Hey guys! I'm new in this group, and have been cubing for
        approximately 7 &gt; months now.I'm averaging like 33-35 seconds and my
        best single is 25.71 &gt; seconds.I learnt full PLL recently, and needed
        to know which algorithms I &gt; could seriously cut down time on.Here's
        a really rough list of my times in &gt; seconds (the names of the algs
        from thesixsides.com):(Ua) 3.5(Ub) 3.5(Aa) &gt; 3.5(Ab) 3.5(Ga) 4.9(Gc)
        4.3(Gb) 5.5(Gd) 4.2(Ja) 3.4(Jb) 3.4(Rb) 4(Ra) 4.3(H) &gt; 2.5(Y) 3.4(T)
        3.4(E) 5(Z) 3(U) 4.3(V) 4.3(Na) 4.3(Nb) 5.5If anyone wants &gt; to help
        me out, maybe create a list, then use the names for the PLL algs &gt;
        from thesixsides.com. THANKS IN ADVANCE,mryuquan &gt; &gt;

        with the browser. I used to program a lot of graphic applications
        earlier and when I had that problem I usally put a empty space where the
        text goes before the actuall text. In pixel graphics you simply put a
        large rectangle of the same colour as the background in the area to
        clear out the old pixels. For older computer working with strings and
        using fonts of fixed character sizes you used to write a string of
        spaces. Nowdays, when the chars in the fonts has got diffrent withs for
        broad and narrow types that is not as easy to do =) // Kenneth

        According to Wikipedia (and some other webpages): "The first world
        championship organized by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in
        Munich on March 13, 1981. All cubes were moved 40 times and rubbed with
        petroleum jelly. The official winner with a record of 38 seconds was
        Jury Froeschl, born in Munich." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
        Rubik's_Cube#Competitions_and_record_times And from a more trustworthy
        source: "Rainer Seitz organised a Guiness Book of Records bash in Munich
        on 6- 13 March 81 at the Olympia Shopping Centre. The Centre is
        connected with the German publisher of the Guiness Book). The best times
        were 38 seconds, again due to new cubes, achieved by Ronald Brinkmann
        and Jury Fr√∂schl, an 18 year old Munich boy."
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic1.htm#p13 Does someone
        here know more about it? Was it really a championship and worthy of the

        group] Re: Cube Explorer 4.15 released Hello, is the program able to
        mask out some cubie ? E.g. to explore Roux cmll . There must be a
        posibility to disable some compares of egdes or corners. I try to
        develop a program in standart C, to do that. (i use a mac) Greets Andrea

        Hi :-) It's the first time i have heard of a "1981 WC". I read up on
        anything i could find about the cube in the early 80's and i never heard
        of this back then. I guess it was nothing but a Guiness WR attempt
        stunt, and not a widely accepted one as there were many other much
        faster competition times achieved back then. Just read what has been
        written by Jessica and Guus. The name Ronald Brinkmann rings a bell. I
        came across it many times, but not sure where and how. One should not be
        too harsh when reading about the solving times achieved back then. For
        one, the cubes were mostly much worse than the ones we have now. Also i
        guess most were completely self taught on the cube, not having access to
        the vast array of methods and algorithms we have nowadays :D -Per &gt;

        enough to interview Stefan and agree with proofreading, but he/she also

        The Swedish cubers do know. The event was discussed on our site some
        months ago. (How did they determine the winner; there were two persons

        1981 Munich? I think that journalist deserves a compliment. Not only was
        he/she smart enough to interview Stefan and agree with proofreading, but
        he/she also found a pretty big event (maybe not really WC-class, but
        still) that almost none of us knew about. After all the previous "bad
        press" posts, this is good hear. On Wed, 05 Dec 2007 13:50:31 -0000,

        wasn't a "world" championship but only a local record attempt. The
        journalist I mentioned a few days ago sent me her article to proofread
        it and it mentions the 1981 Munich thing as the first WC, that's how I
        found out about it. There's a radio interview with the winner of that

        Hi guys, Today is a Dutch national holiday (Sinterklaas). Today 8 years
        ago I received the computer game Rubik's Games as a present. Via this
        game I found Chris Hardwick and Ton Dennenbroek. Soon after we found Dan
        Knights and Mat Wilder. I never thought our community would grow this
        big. And we will grow again in 2008. If you are in a new cubing country:
        organise yourselves and take the initiative for meetings and
        competitions. Have fun, Ron

        Ron, That's amazing to think that this all started thanks to
        Sinterklaas! I think he should be called the patron saint of speedcubing
        from now on ;) Great game as well, Rubik's Games. I got it in the same
        period as you. Even to this day I think the Rubik's Cube simulator in
        there is one of the best ever made in terms of user friendliness. It
        just had a very nice feel to it that I miss in all applets that are
        around these days. And it had all 4 sizes as well (2x2x2-5x5x5). For me
        it was the first go I ever had at solving the big cubes and it remained
        the only way for doing so for many years after. Lars --- In

        Rubik's Clock At Dutch National I could buy a clock for 1 Euro. It was
        very bad, but after opening it, cleaning it and lubing it, it is pretty
        good. On Wed, 05 Dec 2007 08:17:14 -0000, "magicbri2000" wrote: Hi

        A while ago, I had the link to this really useful website for help with
        algorithms. It had a cube applet, and you could type in the algorithm
        you wish to be performed, and you can have the cube do the moves, or the
        inverse. It's been a while since I've been to that site, and I lost the

        What I mean is that a good clock could be sold that much. But you can
        find decent ones for 1 currency unit. ;-) On Dec 6, 2007 7:59 AM, Gilles

        Hello. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So in terms of the US dollar, it is about one
        dollar? Also, would 20 US &gt; &gt; dollars for it, plus shipping, be a
        reasonable price for it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brian &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every now and then clocks,
        magics and other rare-to-find-in-shops &gt; &gt; &gt; puzzles come up
        for sale at ebay. This should be the best place i &gt; &gt; &gt; guess.
        Quite cheap, but there will be additional shipping costs. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        opening it, cleaning it and lubing it, it is pretty good. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Just look at the number of competitions we had this year, compare to the
        rest of the yaers and you see this is the year when it really started to
        grow big. At my first comp in 2005 I had a time of like 38, that gave me

        Dear Cubers, I am curious about why it pops, sometime. I would be glad
        to hear from you about pop. In the recent worlds-2007, I had a bad pop.
        Normally, it happens to me in my loose 444 cube. But it happened to me
        in 333 for the first time. When your mind think ahead and want to go
        faster but your hand (finger speed is less) is not going that fast, it
        pops. Perhaps too tight cube may be cause for pop. I remember, Ron uncle
        telling me to have more control when solving, when we met in 2005. Now,
        I understand that means mind and fingering should go together. J.Bernett

        Hello. This is a rather good topic to discuss. I have a DIY cube from
        cube4you.com, and it always pops on me. That is why I cannot go fast.
        However, my other cubes do not pop, but I wish for my DIY to be in a
        state where I will not be afraid of it popping. According to my
        empirical observations, a cube pops when it has a loose center
        mechanism. This is found most often in cubes where you are able to turn
        a corner in it at least 45 degrees, putting it into an "impossible"
        solved state. I found that tightening it often times does help it from
        not popping. However, more observation should be conducted to test my
        theory. Brian ----- Original Message ---- From: JohnLouis Louis

        Lies, damn lies, statistics! If you write it down like that, it looks
        like speedcubing made it's biggest leap in 2004. If you write it down
        like this, it looks like speedcubing made it's biggest leap this year.
        2003 +02 2004 +10 2005 +12 2006 +9 2007 +20 It is almost always true
        that the first year (or two) have the biggest growth (percentage-wise)
        in these types of scenarios. Going from a 1-man business (or household)
        to a 2-person is a big step, from 99 to 101 is bigger and smaller
        depending how you look at it. I think we should spread the competitions
        more. If done correctly I could have gone to 1 competition every week :)

        &gt; Older Rubik's has got flat centres, those pops easier but allows
        you to cut coners earlier in triggers (this is also the reson for the
        pop, you cut to much). Newer cubes that has got arched centres only pops
        if the screews are to loose. Again, loose centres allows more cutting
        corners, that's why we don't tighten the screews more than enough to
        keep the pieces in place most of the times. I myself are wery presice in
        my turns and sedomly pops no matter the cube so I prefer the older type,
        much because I use a lot of slice turns (MES but mostly M) and these are
        much easier to do on a flat centre cube. But still, the cube I use most
        for practising is a customized anny where I removed the original spider
        that has got rivets for one old 80's replica spider with screews (wery
        nice spider). That one I normally pop in say 1:100 solves. The treads of
        the screews are pretty steep so they comes out by themself after a while
        and when one of them has gone to a certian point it starts to pop in
        almost every solve... Because of just one centre! // Kenneth

        things like screw tension evenness is a big factor. what i do with
        cube4you cubes is tighten the screwes into only one rivet or thread is
        seen when you pull out the center pieces. the cube should be really
        tight at first. work it in for a bit, the longer the better. then you
        put a tiny bit of lube, and your cube will become quite amazing, and
        still very tight. i've had pop problems a lot in the past, and cube
        building experiments kind of helped me find how to adjust it rite as
        well as good advice. [Non-text portions of this message have been

        I was just on: http://www.bigcubes.com/5x5x5/lastedges.html And
        re-learned all of the special extra algs for last two edge triplets on
        the 5, which I once knew but quickly forgot. Only took about 10 minutes
        since I knew them before. I thought it would be prudent to compute the
        probablities of the need for each alg, and thought that the site should
        be updated to include this, but in the meanwhile wanted to share my
        findings here. I prefer to call them by different names, but for the
        sake of clearity I'm going to follow the site's naming scheme: [N] all
        correct (1/24) [N] double wing swap (1/24) [N] double wing swap with
        flipped orientation (1/24)* [N] simple match/flip (1/3) [N] double edge
        flip (1/24) [P] single edge flip (1/12) [P] double parity (1/12)* [P]
        edge flip/swap (1/6) [P] checkerboard (1/6)* [N] for no parity, [P] for
        parity. I only needed to re-learn the three I starred, and now it is
        obvious what priority I should practice them and how much time I should
        be spending on each. It should also be noted that this is the 'natural'
        uniform probability, where as certain tactics of pairing may yield
        statistically skewed results... notably the 'single edge flip' case may
        occur more often in "greedy" (triplets-first) stratagies. -Doug

        Unless your cube is really causing you problems (i.e. jamming/popping a
        lot) don't be so quick to blame it on the cube. The most skilled cubers
        can still get under 20 seconds with brand new unprepared cubes. Rubik's
        brand cubes are almost always better than the cheaper knock-off
        versions. A lot of people like the DIY cubes where you can adjust the
        spring tension to your liking. You can get DIY cubes at 9spuzzles.com or
        cube4you.com. In any case, keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that
        a new cube will be solely responsible for dropping your time from the
        30s to sub-20. Shelley --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I am pretty sure this is the right Jury Fr√∂schl, after I just listened
        to that audio file which has been mentioned previously. In that it was
        told that the winner studied computer science ("Informatik") and is now
        45 years old, which matches the data given in the link. Cornelius --- In

        What a coincidence! After many years I just got interested again in
        cubes, when I found out about the upcoming Olympic Cubes (very
        impressive...), and thus I started googling around, and by chance found
        this discussion! I can tell about this event from first hand experience,
        since I am one of those few attendees in Munich 1981. Unfortunately I
        remember only vaguely after more than 25 years... Back in the early 80's
        I was a student in Munich, and somehow learned very early how to solve
        the cube. I invented some algorithms and got told others from friends,
        and practiced a lot, so my times were around 1 min. It was a rare art
        then. I remember one Saturday when I did a cube in the local super
        store, and the manager saw me, caught me right away and offered me 20 DM
        for an hour or two of demonstrations and selling cubes. Easy money :-)
        Somehow I was in contact with Rainer Seitz (I think I wrote a letter -
        no emails at that time :-)) and got an invitation for that speed cubing
        event in the Munich Olympia Center. In my recollection it wasn't a World
        Championship (but I may be wrong, or I may mix up two different
        events?). The competition which I remember was a local Munich city
        championship, or something Bavarian or so. We were a dozen or so
        competitors, some 50 spectators, some reporters and a TV guy (which I
        remember clearly, because he lay down on the floor and filmed me from
        there upwards in a very unusual angle, but I think it did not make it
        into the news). Rainer Seitz had a suitcase, which he handled very
        secretly, and which contained some prepared cubes, all set up
        identically. In fact, I think those were spare cubes, and he always
        re-did the solved cube from the previous attempt and set it up the same
        way again (of course, he let nobody watch him), and then the next
        attendee could try. I am still proud of my result: I finished third, in
        45 seconds. I guess I was somewhat lucky, since that was better than my
        average time of 55-60 sec. I remember the winner's time indeed being 38
        sec, so most likely I was at the same competition which was mentioned
        here. I always told friends later that I scored third at the Munich
        speedcubing city championship. And, of course, at that day nobody was
        interested in anybody besides the winner. So I took my prize for the
        third place and went home. I think I remember (not sure, though) that at
        that time I knew the very best solving times to be around 29-30 sec., so
        I wasn't too impressed with our 38-45 sec results (and many others well
        over 1 min) and never had the idea that we did more than a local Munich
        event. Regards, Cornelius --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; In case you think the 38 seconds made me ask whether it was

        have been done for utilizing this effort. Actually Java language is
        Machine independent and can convert itself to the environment of the
        machine where it has been used. Ajpplets are Precompiled code of java
        language that can be utilized to works wonder. in sms.pakistan.sc i have
        used this technology on preliminary basis. Students will have to wriite
        code in java as Applet specifications and aftr compile it use its .CLASS

        Hi everyone, For fun recently I've been looking at numbers of the form
        10^n+1 where n is a nonnegative integer. For n=0, n=1, and n=2 we have
        prime numbers and I was curious if this occurs for any other values of
        n. I proved that if n &gt; 2 and has a factor, k, that is an odd number
        then 10^n+1 is divisible by 10^(n/k)+1 What I am curious about is if n
        is a power of 2. Then we have 10^ (2^m)+1 where m is a nonnegative
        integer. I've looked at this and I don't know of a way to factor this
        kind of term, if there is even a way to factor it. I used this site,
        http://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM, to find that 10^(2^m)+1 is
        composite up to m=13. I can't test any higher than 13 because the
        program won't allow numbers over 10000 digits. I search google for
        numbers of the form 10^n+1 but could not find anything that helped
        answer my questions about n being a power of 2. I also searched here
        (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Prime- RelatedNumbers.html) to see
        if I could find if numbers of the form 10^n+1 had a name and if they
        were potential primes for certain n but I could not find numbers of this
        form. I feel like I am either missing something trivial, or maybe these
        numbers are potential primes and I need to know more theory to see why
        or how. If anyone here has looked at this type of large number, could
        you offer a hint of how I can continue to see if there is a way to
        factor 10^(2^m)+1 for m a nonnegative integer if this is even possible?
        I am curious if large numbers of this form are potential primes. Thanks,
        Chris

        I'm not sure if these have been mentioned before somewhere (hopefully
        not) but I think I found two new algorithms for 2 OLLs, Case 3 and 4 on
        Macky's site. They're the ones that have a dot in the middle and an
        oriented corner in the top right hand corner. Case 3: y [f (R U R' U')
        f'] U' [F (R U R' U') F'] Case 4: [f (R U R' U') f'] U [F (R U R' U')
        F'] Of course for case 3 you can omit the y cube turn, but I couldn't
        post any pictures. As you can see, they're the algorithm for one of the
        T OLLs, with the first iteration done with a double layered F turn. I

        with today's hardware. Attacking it algebraically or using number theory
        is probably not going to lead anywhere either. This is similar to Fermat
        Numbers 2^n+1 and then to the special case of Fermat numbers of the form
        2^k+1, where k itself is a power of 2. There are only 5 such prime
        numbers known to exist: 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. It is not even clear if
        there are more - but there is no reason to assume there shouldn't be,
        yet none can be found with today's hardware, and unlikely in the near
        future. Now to address your form or 10^k+1. This would be best observed
        as (2^k)(5^k)+1, for k a power of 2. Note that these can not be treated
        as a variation of Proth Primes. Proth primes have a certain trick to
        them that allows for quick computation. But here the (5^k) &gt; k in the
        exponent of 2. Although it is not clear to me if you can still say that
        numbers of your form, 10^k+1, are prime if and only if: there exists b
        such that b^((10^k)/2) = 1 (mod N). Oh also, might be relavent to
        Piermont Primes, which are more like 6^k+1, but it might help. -Doug ---

        Hi, On Nov 15, 2007 I ordered 8 fl. oz of Cube Lube from
        www.cubelube.com The money was taken from my account but I never
        received my cubelube. I have requested order status from cubelube. com
        by email three times since DEC 8, 2007 but as yet have received no
        response. Does anyone here know if www.cubelube.com is a legitimate site
        selling a legitimate product? If not, is there a reasonably priced
        product similar to the product that comes in the syringe with the diy
        kits? Your insight is appreciated. Thanks everybody! berndtrinva@...

        I had a similar experience. I had ordered from CubeLube.com in the past
        and received my product within days, so I was surprised when I didn't
        receive my recent order as quickly. After two weeks I emailed them to
        find out if my shipment had been lost in the mail - no response. Since
        then I've sent two additional emails - still no response. I placed my
        order on October 31st - it's been seven weeks and I still haven't
        received the product nor have I received a response to my emails. Since
        I really like a liquid lube and don't want to use an aerosol, I have
        been experimenting with other products to use as a replacement. The main
        ingredient in Cube Lube is *Polydimethylsiloxanes* (silicon oil - CAS
        #63148-62-9). This ingredient is also used in many car waxes, floor
        waxes, and furniture polishes. However, I have yet to find a product
        that works as well. Cube Lube is available from www.rubiks.com, but only
        if purchased in small quanitities (by the syringe) and only if purchased
        along with stickers. I'm not crazy about the Rubiks brand stickers (I
        much prefer cubesmith tiles), and I'd like to purchase in larger
        quantities. So I've basically discounted rubiks.com as a source. It is
        also available from http://stores.ebay.com/PuzzleProz (an ebay store),
        but only by the syringe ($2.00 each). This is a much better deal than
        rubiks.com, but considerably more expensive than buying in bulk from
        CubeLube.com. However, most importantly, they are reliable and they do
        ship out the product you order. If anyone on this forum has any better
        suggestions, I'd really appreciate them. On 12/18/07, berndtrinva

        I have 3 timers (gen 1, 2 and 2.5), and a bunch of mats. In general I
        would recommend just getting the $20 timer itself (it's labled as simply
        "Competition Timer") and has the "data port" for interfacign with the
        large displays, which is quite important I believe. I think they are the
        same price but this added flexiblity that we've come to take for granted
        means that your tiemr could then be used for competitions. (I've seen
        about 3 timers fail in 3 different comptitions I've attended.) The
        actual anser to your question depends on wheather you need a mat. I
        recommend aganst getting the small/mini mats. Note that, the new mats
        come in so many designs now. I got the colorful bubbles one, and never
        used it. These are quite thin compared to say gen 1 and standard mouse
        pads. What I do is punch holes in regular black mouse pads and use that.
        It's a ton cheaper and I prefer a black background as well as the
        smaller size, and thickness. You ask about the 'generations'... They
        only sell the newest one, the distinction with other gen-2 models is
        that it is a brighter blue, parts stay lit while off (acting as a
        clock), and there are 2 additional buttons of up and down for such
        settings. It has a memory to store 3 times, not including the one that
        stays there between sessions (when there is a time displayed, it will
        still be there when you turn it off and back on later). One thing to
        note, is that they sell both with data port and without (no idea why
        they'd even sell the later). The savings on the manufacturing-side
        doesn't seem to add up to the diffed design from what I know of IOE...
        I'm sure the profit margin is negligable and not worth the confusion to
        consumers. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, David

        &gt; I had a similar experience. I had ordered from CubeLube.com in the

        surprised when I didn't &gt; receive my &gt; &gt; recent order as
        quickly. After two weeks I emailed them to find out &gt; if my &gt; &gt;
        shipment had been lost in the mail - no response. Since then I've &gt;
        sent two &gt; &gt; additional emails - still no response. I placed my
        order on October &gt; 31st - &gt; &gt; it's been seven weeks and I still
        haven't received the product nor &gt; have I &gt; &gt; received a
        response to my emails. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since I really like a liquid
        lube and don't want to use an aerosol, &gt; I have &gt; &gt; been
        experimenting with other products to use as a replacement. The &gt; main
        &gt; &gt; ingredient in Cube Lube is *Polydimethylsiloxanes* (silicon
        oil - CAS &gt; &gt; #63148-62-9). This ingredient is also used in many
        car waxes, floor &gt; waxes, &gt; &gt; and furniture polishes. However,
        I have yet to find a product that &gt; works as &gt; &gt; well. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Cube Lube is available from www.rubiks.com, but only if
        purchased in &gt; small &gt; &gt; quanitities (by the syringe) and only
        if purchased along with &gt; stickers. I'm &gt; &gt; not crazy about the
        Rubiks brand stickers (I much prefer cubesmith &gt; tiles), &gt; &gt;
        and I'd like to purchase in larger quantities. So I've basically &gt;
        discounted &gt; &gt; rubiks.com as a source. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is
        also available from http://stores.ebay.com/PuzzleProz (an ebay &gt;
        store), &gt; &gt; but only by the syringe ($2.00 each). This is a much
        better deal than &gt; &gt; rubiks.com, but considerably more expensive
        than buying in bulk from &gt; &gt; CubeLube.com. However, most
        importantly, they are reliable and they &gt; do ship &gt; &gt; out the
        product you order. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone on this forum has any
        better suggestions, I'd really &gt; appreciate &gt; &gt; them. &gt; &gt;

        Hey guys, if someone could e-mail me off list with some insight to this
        I'd appreciate it, been bugging me all night. I ran across this one on
        the internet today and have tried a few strategies that do not work out:
        Consider the set, S, of vertices of a regular n-gon. Now consider a
        subset, A, of k of these vertices. What is the probability that A will
        contain to adjacent verticies? Obviously for k&lt;2, or k&gt;n/2 the
        probability is 0. I'm having a bit of trouble hashing out what happens
        in between. First I considered the set of adjacent pairs and non
        adjacent pairs, but failed to realize that the union of two non-adjacent
        pairs could contain an adjacent pair. Then I tried a counting argument
        for how many ways you could choose k points such that no two are
        adjacent, but n=7 gave me problems there. There's got to be something
        simple I'm missing. It is trivial for a given n, but I cannot seem to
        generalize a formula. At any rate, it's really bugging me and I know we
        are privlaged with some brilliant mathematical minds. As I said I don't
        want to tie up the list too much, so feel free to e-mail me over at
        spud(remove this for spam purposes)quibber(the at symbol here)gmail(one

        I'd still need a video to convince me it's true, but it looks legitamate
        enough. I'm throughly impressed. It doesn't specify if it computes
        optimal solutions, but if it does, than doing so in "1 second" is very
        scary. I'm thinking at least 10GB of pruning tables and a lot of RAM. A
        few questions come to mind. How long did it take to develop? How much
        money did it cost to build that prototype? (Sure looks expensive...) Is
        the 6s with or without lube? How well does it fair against lock-ups?
        What device does it use for the color-recognition? When I was working on
        something like this, we had to program in stratigies for it to
        automatically detect and auto-correct for lock- ups by turning the other
        direction. This requires feedback control (and like a watchdog timer
        that kicks in if there's no movement for x number of milliseconds). Also
        it is possible to have it do a bit of look-ahead and execute 'triggers'
        dynamically. If it can do all this... it should be able to solve any
        cube in just under 3.00. Since it doesn't there is still much room for
        improvement. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        organization only by a friend that directed me here. I think you guys
        would agree this is probably the best community of Rubik's lovers and we
        wanted to create a community. As you can see, we've published a link to
        this site so others can join here too. Please don't take it the wrong

        Hi RJ, Let us start over. You are very welcome to our community of
        puzzle fans. You are very welcome to create a website. I look forward to
        more content on your site. But please don't try to create NEW
        communities. We already have several good forums/communities: - for
        official stuff: http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum - for the more
        scientific view on puzzles: http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/ - the
        oldest online club, with various content: this Yahoo club - for puzzle
        collecting/designing/building and some speedcubing:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/ - the most active forum, for all kinds
        of questions: http://www.speedsolving.com/ There is no need for more of
        the same. And if you have something different, then first consider
        adding it to the current forums/communities. Again, a new website with
        good content is always welcome. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message

        Ah yes, I mis spoke for k&gt;n/2. I did try the method you mentioned,
        but that's when I had problems with n = 7: Choosing non-adjacent points
        When k = 3, For the first vertex you have 7 possible choices. For the
        second you have 4 choice (n-3). But depending on which of those 4 you
        choose you could have either 1 or 2 choices for the third point. My
        teeny non-combinatoric brain can't really process that into a nice

        Cube in 6 Seconds I'd still need a video to convince me it's true, but
        it looks legitamate enough. I'm throughly impressed. It doesn't specify
        if it computes optimal solutions, but if it does, than doing so in "1
        second" is very scary. I'm thinking at least 10GB of pruning tables and
        a lot of RAM. A few questions come to mind. How long did it take to
        develop? How much money did it cost to build that prototype? (Sure looks
        expensive...) Is the 6s with or without lube? How well does it fair
        against lock-ups? What device does it use for the color-recognition?
        When I was working on something like this, we had to program in
        stratigies for it to automatically detect and auto-correct for lock- ups
        by turning the other direction. This requires feedback control (and like
        a watchdog timer that kicks in if there's no movement for x number of
        milliseconds). Also it is possible to have it do a bit of look-ahead and
        execute 'triggers' dynamically. If it can do all this... it should be
        able to solve any cube in just under 3.00. Since it doesn't there is
        still much room for improvement. -Doug --- In

        You've been part of this community for 3 1/2 weeks. I just don't
        understand why some people think that just because we have a common

        Yeah, that was pretty funny. It's one of the high offenses in this
        community: to spell the word as 'Rubics' or 'Rubix.' I'm at work right
        now, so I'm a bit busy, but if people have time, can they figure out if
        this site is generating revenue in any way? Or, what are the ways this
        site generates revenue in addition to offering "our recommended rubics
        products." It seems pretty simple, that the motivation for this site is
        by people who know nothing about the Rubik's Cube simply trying to
        capitalize on an already booming market. Actually, it reminds me of the

        RJ Martino explained that the site plans to host advertising but is
        waiting for the number of "hits" (times people access the site) to rise.
        Advertisers consider the popularity of the site before buying

        Wow... you are really treating this like it's some type of scam! I just
        threw a web site together that was going to try and keep links
        manageable. For a long time I was using del.icio.us and then I realized
        that some people were probably having a difficult time (like I was)
        finding sites. I decided to register a domain and throw my links on a
        site. I know you guys are experts but it wasn't easy finding the sites
        you mentioned. We can stop this discussion when your ready... like I
        said... All I was trying to do was help the game and the education of
        the game. If you're wondering about the site, I am an open book... ask
        away... no need to try and dig up stuff on a site. --- In

        &gt; site before buying advertising space. RJ Martino said he expects

        People aren't automatically going to support it just because you ask

        a community site because you have something to offer, not just because
        you want to be the biggest on the block. Spelling Rubik's as Rubic's
        doesn't win you any credibility either. We have Speedcubing.com, and we
        have this Yahoo Groups forum, among others. What does your site offer
        that would make us want to support it? If you are new to cubing, the
        proper thing to do is join already established communities and get a
        feel for what they're like, what the people are like, what they want.
        THEN, if you want to make your own site to address what you perceive as
        the community's needs, feel free to do so. Do you have any idea how
        disorganized we would be by now if every newbie felt it was his duty to
        restructure the community? Don't just copy and paste information
        available from elsewhere and expect us to all flock to your site. Not
        only do you have the text from an outdated article copied from the
        Associated Press on the front page, you have "Written by Ryan James, 15

        Hi Daniel, To summarize my arguments below, the probability you seek is,
        if I haven't made a mistake, 1 - [C(n-k,k) / C(n-1,k)]. Note that if
        k&lt;2, then the probability evaluates to 1, and if k&gt;n/2, then the
        probability evaluates to 0, as desired. Stefan brings up a good point,
        in that we should apply the tactic that is normally involved in solving
        ring problems: convert it to a line. Pick a random point and throw it
        out. We have now reduced the problem to choosing k points from n-1
        points. Note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
        solutions for this new (easier) linear problem and the solutions to the
        ring problem. We must choose k points from n-1 points such that at least
        2 are consecutive. Instead consider the complement: choosing the k
        points such that no two are consecutive. Then simply subtract the
        probability from 1 to get the desired value. To choose k points from n-1
        points such that no two are consecutive, first imagine laying down the
        n-k-1 points in a line, with a space in between each one where a point
        in our subset can go. There is thus a space in between every pair of the
        n-k-1 points, as well as spaces on either end of the marble chain. Thus
        there are n-k spaces into which we can put k spaces. There are C(n-k,k)
        to distribute the k balls into the n-k spaces (this follows from an
        elementary combinatorial property), and thus there are C(n-k,k)
        solutions to the problem, and there are C(n-k,k) ways to choose the k
        points such that no two are consecutive. There are C(n-1,k) ways to
        choose k points in general from n-1 points, so the probability of
        choosing k points such that no two are consecutive is C(n-k,k) /
        C(n-1,k). The probability of choosing k points such that at least two
        are consecutive is therefore 1 - [C(n-k,k) / C(n-1,k)].

        Looks like a beautiful solution to me. And it matches up for the values
        of n and k I've enumerated by hand. The only quibble I have is that the
        formula breaks for k=n. Obviously the probability at k=n is 1, but we
        get the indeterminate form 0/0. I assume this is because we threw out a
        random point to begin with, and therefor define it not in any subset
        subset? If anyone is curious about the source of the problem, it is
        this: http://tinyurl.com/2vjpjd (google video) Thanks for the work and

        we had to program in &gt; stratigies for it to automatically detect and

        requires feedback control &gt; (and like a watchdog timer that kicks in
        if there's no movement for x &gt; number of milliseconds). Also it is
        possible to have it do a bit of &gt; look-ahead and execute 'triggers'

        you claiming to write it. At least you could reference &gt; &gt; the
        author of the original article somewhere, and post the link at the &gt;
        &gt; beginning rather than at the end. Better yet, just post the link to
        &gt; &gt; the article with maybe an excerpt to introduce it, instead of
        copying &gt; &gt; and pasting the entire text. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        We posted questions so people could see its there... theres something
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in it. I was trying to get a community of writers and
        moderators... &gt; &gt; &gt; Thats why I was led here... I was hoping to
        get a community ran site &gt; &gt; &gt; together... didn't know it
        already existed... Now I'm sitting here &gt; &gt; &gt; wasting time just
        trying to defend my character. It seems silly that &gt; &gt; &gt; we're
        wasting our time here... I've used my real name... I'm not &gt; &gt;
        &gt; trying to hide anything... This is me trying to push what I thought
        &gt; &gt; &gt; was a helpful site. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So now you
        see that a community already exists. Why waste your time &gt; &gt;
        arguing with us? From this discussion you should be able to see that
        &gt; &gt; what you thought was helpful is different from what we think
        is &gt; &gt; helpful. Instead of wasting more time, why don't you do
        something &gt; &gt; about it? Hey look, I've just given you a
        suggestion. As have a lot of &gt; &gt; other people. Why not try
        implementing it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A word to the wise, people will be
        more likely to join a new site if &gt; &gt; it's started by someone
        who's already well established within the &gt; &gt; community, someone
        who most of us already know. We're far less likely &gt; &gt; if the site
        creator is so new he can't even spell Rubik's correctly. &gt; &gt; Spend
        some time with us and get to know us first before trying to &gt; &gt;
        assume a leadership position. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        i have a 25th anniversary rubik's.com cube, and i have lubed it quite a
        lot of times.. using silicon spray...and now my cube has a lot of sticky
        spots.. meaning that when i turn any face 360degrees,it kinda sticks
        every 30degrees... i tried cleaning it completely and relubing it.. but
        it still is sticky... wats ur opinion...(btw.. i hav been using my cube
        for about 6 months) thanks a lot! urs, chris

        Hi :-) Instead of making many small topics i make this one. The new
        website recently discussed mostly has old stuff in it. And the design is
        not compatible with internet explorer. The menu is in the wrong position
        entirely. I suggest to redesign the menu with proper javascript that is
        not using its own layer, but integrates with the page. Secondly, this
        yahoo group has lately been hard to access. I got messages saying
        invalid group or got empty pages .. etc ... And finally, does anyone
        have the fewest moves scramble from the swedish cube day?? Lastly

        ah i hate it when i miss something like this because i'm too busy to
        check this everyday. i would indeed assume the only motivation for the
        site is to make money. he has nothing to offer, no new ideas, he just
        wants the traffic to generate revenue for him and his imaginary friend.
        the current communities are very accessible and in my opinion there are
        actually too many as is. as far as informational sites, as ron said
        there is always room for new informational sites, but i would encourage
        bringing something new to the table (which as a total and utter newb
        would be hard for you to achieve right now) instead of using other
        people's work. i think you are a nice enough guy that thought he had a
        good money making idea and went too far with it before researching and
        seeing that it wasn't practical. i'm sure we would love to have you in
        the rubiks community if you square up and abondon these ideas of
        profiting off of our hobby. Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...&gt; wrote:

        No need for an optimal solution; Kociemba's algorithm will give a 20-21
        move solution in under a second almost always, and that's not far off
        the usual 18-move optimal solution. It would be cool to see an actual
        video. It doesn't look like it could use force feedback much; I'll bet
        if you put an ornery cube in there it would just shatter. --- In

        to build that prototype? (Sure looks &gt; expensive...) Is the 6s with

        device does it use for the color-recognition? &gt; &gt; When I was
        working on something like this, we had to program in &gt; stratigies for
        it to automatically detect and auto-correct for lock- &gt; ups by
        turning the other direction. This requires feedback control &gt; (and
        like a watchdog timer that kicks in if there's no movement for x &gt;
        number of milliseconds). Also it is possible to have it do a bit of &gt;
        look-ahead and execute 'triggers' dynamically. If it can do all &gt;
        this... it should be able to solve any cube in just under 3.00. Since
        &gt; it doesn't there is still much room for improvement. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Shatter? So in my experience with these sorts of things, when a cube
        locks-up, the motors stop entirely (or vibrate back and forth violently
        depending on the type of motor)... either way it gets stuck in a loop
        and starts to *massively* draw current and heat up. If left like that
        for too long many motors will permenantly break. I guess if the overall
        strucutre is weaker than the standing-torque of the motor then the
        plastic covering could crack. Though it looks so expensive, I'd hope
        they've considered that. A good test for these things would be to place
        a solid cube in there and see what happens :). Another thing that is
        possible though unlikely, is for the motors to be turning so fast that
        the plastic melts (happend to me a few times), and the cube locks up
        chemically... in which case you'd have to pry pieces apart and sand them
        back. Hem... I've had a lot of fun with motor controlled cubes in my day
        :). -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "tomrokicki"

        doesn't look &gt; like it could use force feedback much; I'll bet if you

        dethroned. Basically, Whatever rank Matyas &gt; is, I wanna be 1 or more
        higher...He needs to stop cleaning up, and &gt; I'm stepping in. &gt;

        I think we can all cut down on the sarcasm/hate/etc when a newb starts
        off with the wrong impression. He did clean up his 'mistakes' on the
        site as far as I can see now. There have been numerous discussions about
        setting up new forums mostly due to the fact that the Yahoo forum lacks
        certain feautures (reply by email doesn't work for me e.g. (- anyone
        know why?), and no accessible threads). Still e.g. Ryan Heise made a
        good effort to take away the pain while leaving the forum intact.
        There's nothing against a Rubik's cube site, and if it has a forum on
        it, why not. Maybe it's best to call it 'RJ MARTINO'S CUBE CLUB' so at
        least we know it's not supposed to replace anything with a similar
        target group. Maybe a good idea for RJ to develop is to support local
        groups in his website. Every local group can then have their own tiny
        little forum section, videos and pictures of meetings, etc. Although I
        usually like to trust bigger names in the market like google groups, msn
        groups etc. Another interesting one is http://rubikscube.meetup.com/

        This happens and because there are no screws there is nothing you can do
        about it. However, you can make two hybrid 5x5x5's: 1. Get a new one 2a.

        caps and you will see the it has screws, or what looks like screws. You
        may try tightening theses screws ans see what happens. ----- Original

        Does anyone think that it would be a good idea to orient edges before
        orienting corners? I've always done it the other way around, but I
        realize that recognizing corner orientation is always more difficult
        than recognizing edge orientation. I feel like I sometimes waste time
        (not much, but some) figuring out which corner orientation to do, and
        that if I did it the other way around, I could use the time in which I'm
        orienting the edges to make sure I know what I'm doing next. Does anyone
        think this is worth it? I currently average 31-33. Just a thought...

        I always teach edge orient first, then corner orient. Edge orientation
        is easier to recognize at a glance, and you can use F R U R' U' F' / F U
        R U' R' F' which are short and easy to do. In fact, a lot of people who
        do a 3 look last layer orient edges first. So give it a try and see if
        it works for you. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, David

        If you want an accurate shipping quote, I'd suggest checking both
        websites instead of asking us. Like all legitimate merchants, both
        rubiks.com and cube4you.com quote prices (including freight) prior to
        charging your credit card, and both ship worldwide. If you had checked
        the websites, however, you would have noticed that rubiks.com doesn't
        sell the megaminx - it isn't a Rubik's product. On 12/25/07, harsha557

        Hello everybody. I just got a Rubik's Clock off eBay, and it is quite
        fun. However, it is very very stiff. The yellow buttons are hard to push
        often times and need some "jiggling" to get the moving. Also, the dials,
        on occasion, are hard to turn. Should I just break it in or commence to
        disassemble and lube it? I hope for the former, because I don't want to
        damage my clock. Brian

        However, it is very very stiff. The yellow buttons are hard to push
        often times and need some "jiggling" to get the moving. Also, the dials,
        on occasion, are hard to turn. Should I just break it in or commence to
        disassemble and lube it? I hope for the former, because I don't want to
        damage my clock. Brian

        Hi :-) You may also have a look at Stefan Pochmann's disassembling pages

        Hi :-) Lots of rush ill-fated conclusions in this thread. First of all,
        the retooled Rubiks 5x5x5 are looser than the old ones, yes, and may not
        suit all styles of cubing. But is it bad? No not at all. It's
        excellent!! Secondly, only old Wahn cubes (Krell cubes) and mefferts
        varieties have adjustable screws for the middle centers. If you have any
        Rubiks/Studio version you are in bad luck. Non-adjustable rivets inside
        ... Grrrr ... My 2+ cents! -Per &gt; --- In

        everybody. I just got a Rubik's Clock off eBay, and it is quite fun.
        However, it is very very stiff. The yellow buttons are hard to push
        often times and need some "jiggling" to get the moving. Also, the dials,
        on occasion, are hard to turn. Should I just break it in or commence to
        disassemble and lube it? I hope for the former, because I don't want to
        damage my clock. Brian

        Brian, You can spray lube into the button holes. Then keep moving the

        Hello everybody. I just got a Rubik's Clock off eBay, and it is quite
        fun. However, it is very very stiff. The yellow buttons are hard to push
        often times and need some "jiggling" to get the moving. Also, the dials,
        on occasion, are hard to turn. Should I just break it in or commence to
        disassemble and lube it? I hope for the former, because I don't want to
        damage my clock. Brian &lt;!-- #ygrp-mkp{ border:1px solid

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we held it at Caltech, a lot
        of people in Northern California &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't be
        able to go. And either way, people on the East Coast &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; generally aren't able to come to a California competition. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please don't ask silly
        questions like this. Tournament locations &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        aren't decided based on who can and can't go. If you want a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; competition at location X, you organize your own
        competition at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location X. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Yeah.. sorry for being snappish earlier, it's just that in the past
        we've had people complain about the locations of our tournaments. We
        have to make do with what we can get, and I know it probably wasn't

        &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. The location. Los Angeles or San Francisco is better
        than Modesto or &gt; &gt; Bakersfield. &gt; &gt; 2. The venue quality.
        Is it a classroom, or an auditorium with stage and &gt; &gt; lighting,
        or a museum that would attract spectator crowds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we held it at
        Caltech, a lot of people in Northern California &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        wouldn't be able to go. And either way, people on the East Coast &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generally aren't able to come to a California
        competition. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please
        don't ask silly questions like this. Tournament locations &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; aren't decided based on who can and can't go. If you want a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competition at location X, you organize your
        own competition at &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location X. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        No. My point was that he was obviously joking in the first place, and
        was simply misinterpretted due to the downfalls of internet
        communication. Thus, as far as I can tell, he is neither a retard, nor
        did he act like one. Furthermore, my usage of the word "retard" was
        meant in a strictly general/pejorative sense; it was not meant
        literally. If your point is that it's inappropriate to use that word
        pejoratively (a legitimate opinion), that would be a conversation for a
        different day, and a different forum. Let's talk about cubing now.

        Hi Everyone, Due to technical difficulties (somebody's been downloading
        a ton of stuff and used up all of my bandwidth!), the Sunday Contest
        will be available at my old web address:
        http://www.geocities.com/nascarjon2001/sunday.htm This will only be
        needed until the end of the month/year. Then it'll be back to:
        http://www.nascarjon.us/sunday.htm Hopefully soon the contest will be
        automated. I've been working with several friends on this and one has
        come up with a great system that is exactly what I wanted. If/when this
        gets implimented, there will be no more waiting for me to update every
        week. Not to mention that I'll have time to do other things (like get
        back into cubing). Thanks everyone for continuing to make the Sunday
        Contest a big success. Jon

        This is an idea I've had on the backburner for a while. It's been higher
        on my todo list than even the NxNxN versions of the simulator (I must
        apologise to those people who wanted an NxNxN feature, you might have to
        wait a bit longer.) Anyway, each year I've decided to write a new cube
        program around Christmas time as a kind of gift back to the community.
        Last year it was the blindfolded cube simulator. This year, it is
        "Rubik's Cube Chat": http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/chat.html It is a
        chatroom with a live virtual cube that is shared by all online users.
        Any moves that you perform will be seen by all others in the chatroom.
        Some possible uses for this tool include teaching someone how to solve
        the cube over the Internet (e.g. letting them pass the cube to you when
        they get stuck and letting you show them how to do the next step),
        having in-depth cube discussions about algorithms or methods that
        involve shared experimentation on a cube, and also (although I haven't
        given it much thought) possibly some new kinds of turn-based games might
        be possible through this kind of a program. So please enjoy my little
        Christmas gift for 2007 :-) -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/

        Hey Ryan, If you have extra time, can I suggest a "Tyson" version of the
        chat? If you could make the chat open up a text only version (no
        colorful cube), and had it look like a putty window (black background
        and white text), I could totally have it on my computer at work :P

        For some reason, online teamsolving has become popular. I did a few
        solves on it with Pedro yesterday... Would it be possible to
        automatically trade off control? (Maybe even in groups? Separate ones so
        that we can race each other? With a timer? And a move counter? And a
        move recorder? :-) Okay, enough ranting on with wishes... By the way,
        the cube is often getting dis-synchronized with the server, so that
        different users see different states and don't understand each other.

        I'll start: 1) what method do you use? 2) how long have you been cubing?
        3) what type of cube do you use? 3a) do you lubricate your cube? 3b) is
        your cube a DIY kit or bought from a store? 4) Do you do turns with your
        fingers instead of your wrists? 5) Can you execute an algorithm while at
        the same time planning what your next case might be? (look-ahead) Yes we

        &gt; Why doesn't Craig (or anyone) come up with a notation for
        scrambling &gt; Magic &gt; so we can actually start solving it in
        competition? I think if solving the Magic for time from unlinked to
        linked is considered pointless, then solving it from scrambled to an
        arbitrarily defined "solved" state is not much better. I've heard
        estimates from lots of Magicers that there are perhaps 300 distinct
        shapes the 2x4 magic can take on that are not flat shapes. By distinct
        shapes that are not flat I am envisioning shapes that can support
        themselves when set on a table in some rotation, and will not collapse
        in on themselves, thus creating a new shape. Call these self supporting,
        non-collapsing shapes "low entropy" shapes. If there are indeed roughly
        300 or so low entropy shapes then it is possible for a human to memorize
        the shortest route to transform each of these shapes into the flat 2x4
        shape. Then, you can memorize the shortest route to transform each of
        the flat shapes to linked, or to unlinked whichever we arbitrarily
        decide is the "solved" state. I predict, given enough time for people to
        fully learn this 2 step algorithm to solve Magic that I've proposed
        above, that we will see times roughly as fast as for 2x2x2 for solving
        the magic. Just because some people don't like Magic as the event it
        currently is I don't think means we should change the event. I would
        consider either format, unlinked to linked solving or solving from
        scrambled, to be equally as "pointless" as some people currently see the
        current format. I just see solving it from scrambled as taking more work
        on the competitor's part to reach high levels than unlinked to linked
        solving, but both are equally as trivial in my eyes. I say if both
        formats are equally as trivial, let us stick to the one that is easiest
        to implement in an official WCA competition for both scramblers and
        judges, which would be the current format. The other option is to
        abolish the event entirely. I personally am very against the latter
        option. Chris

        Wow, you are making a lot of assumptions and most of them really don't
        make sense to me. First, you say that because solving Magic from linked
        to unlinked can be considered pointless so would solving it from
        scrambled to unscrambled be. Now please read that sentence again with
        this analogy: Magic = 3x3x3, linked = identity, unlinked = superflip.
        Everyone can be taught how to link/unlink Magic or superflip/unsuperflip
        3x3x3 in a matter of minutes. But I have met people that couldn't solve
        the Magic (or 3x3x3) if it became scrambled. Then you describe a process
        of learning 300 (many more than Square-1) distinct shapes and 32 (more
        than PLL) 2x4 patterns. To me, that sounds like an extremely advanced
        method comparable to ZBLL. This would in no way compare to the current
        way of solving Magic that doesn't encourage exploring the puzzle at all.
        Finally you say: "Just because some people don't like Magic as the event
        it currently is I don't think means we should change the event". I
        consider people not liking the way an event currently is THE reason to
        change an event. But for now, we are stuck with the current "do T-perm
        as fast as possible" event and I would miss it if it were ever
        cancelled. ----- Original Message ----- From: cmhardw To:

        Yes, we could all teach you, but if you don't live close to one of us
        that will be pretty hard to do (If you do live close to Rotterdam,
        contact me). That is why many people have made tutorials and have put
        them online. There are so many tutorials that there is surely going to
        be one you like. You can start here:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/links.html And if you have any questions,
        just read the tutorial again or try another one. If you really don't
        understand you can ask questions here, or at a forum like
        speedsolving.com. Have fun ----- Original Message ----- From: erick

        I just started about 2 weeks ago, though from what I've read it's not
        much different than blitz chess in cube form. All I've had to use is a
        really old cube that I picked up from a friend's home (it's a Rubik's
        Promotions cube). I'm learning the Lars method, and I can do a couple of
        finger tricks (though not very quickly yet), and my times are around 3
        minutes (which may be to you guys an eternity!) All I want is a plan. I
        would like to know when it's worth it to go out and buy a DIY kit, how
        to assemble it correctly, tips on looking ahead, learning a few finger
        tricks, etc. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        Well, I've never used the petrus method (though i've tinkered with it, i

        majority of speedcubers use the fridrich method (layer-by-layer, as

        lower, I don't know). I'm sure it's not what you want to hear, but if
        you just keep cubing, you will get faster, even if you're not using
        specific strategies to "get faster". I have been cubing for 2 years and
        still do not have a DIY kit (I was supposed to recieve one for
        christmas! they're out of stock at rubik's). . . I've gone through maybe
        a half-dozen store bought cubes, and I think they can be very good. If I
        were you, I'd just go to walmart or target (they have cubes for about
        $9). Buy about 1-3 cubes and then return/exchange the ones which suck
        once you open them(don't turn well, etc.) Alternatively, you can do what
        I do and just open the cubes in the store and pick out one(s) that you
        like the feel of. The rubik's brand packaging makes it possible to
        re-package the cube without damaging the plastic. These stores have VERY

        really up to you about "what's worth it". . . but i'll try to put it

        maybe average 33-34 seconds. So, it makes a definite difference, but I
        wouldn't be worrying about it yet. Also, lube your cube. Now, if only my

        "Now, if only my DIY kit would come in the mail, maybe i'd finally be
        able to break the damn 30-second barrier :-\" A DIY cube really really
        helps decrease one's times but based on my experience, it is possible to
        average much faster than 30 seconds with a store bought cube. Besides, I
        averaged 18 seconds with one of my store bought cubes and I have a
        friend who can do much faster than me with a store bought cube. What I
        am trying to say is that it is mostly about the cuber, not the cube. The
        cube does have a significant impact on how fast one is in speedsolving
        it but the way the cuber sovles it i.e. look-ahead and finger tricks,
        has more of an impact in the speedsolving of a cube. Brian -----

        spurts. So you'll see no progress for weeks, and then suddenly one day
        wake up 2 seconds faster. No one knows why. Don't forget to try to
        figure out new things and trying to solve with as few moves as possible.
        Memorizing sequences is fun and useful, but won't really affect your
        times much until you're under 40 seconds. Getting a good cube right away
        is worth it, since it is now you're forming your basic technique. DIYs
        are great, but a regular store bought cube with some silicon spray is
        really no worse until you're much much faster. On Dec 31, 2007, at

        Hey Stefan, But Magic being the fifth most popular event doesn't mean
        that people actually 'like it,' or see that it is an event that has
        merit and is worth maintaining. 3x3x3 BLD cubing is a very well
        respected event, but it is simply much more difficult to solve a 3x3x3
        cube blindfolded than it is to solve a Magic. The ease in the solving of
        a Magic gets everyone to learn how to do it minutes before the event and
        compete. I'm not saying that Magic isn't worthwhile, but I'm saying the
        difficulty of the event to master and learn to competition grade skills
        is a major contributing factor to the number of competitors. -Tyson On
