          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Yes this is also how I would approach it, pretty much the same as Tim.
 I the T OLL and the P OLL (the two 6 move cases) to orient edges. 
Then for corners I show them R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; and F D2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R to
orient one at a time.  For sune cases they need to orient one corner
twice in the opposite direction.

For permuting corners I use commutators like R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2
R U2 R&#x27; D2 R but I call it using the &quot;storage spot&quot;.  First they see
that the UFR corner is in the incorrect location (say you have the
three cycle UFR->UBR->UBL).  I tell them to take it out of the U layer
and &quot;put it into the storage spot&quot; which is the location DBL.  They do
this with R&#x27; D2 R.  Then I tell them to find the spot where it needs
to go, here UBR, and turn the U layer so that it is at UFR (which I
call the working location).  Rinse and Repeat.

For edges same thing it&#x27;s just that the &quot;storage spot&quot; is DF after you
apply M D2 M&#x27; and they continue the same.

I have also tried to show a little more standard stuff for last layer
and I usually end up confusing people.  But everyone who I&#x27;ve shown
using commutators seems to get it, and when they come back later on
they can still remember what to do - they don&#x27;t forget the moves
because they aren&#x27;t really algorithms to them.

Hope this helps.  I&#x27;ve taught several high school level kids and a
couple middle school level kids how to solve using this method.  I did
teach one 4th grader too, and I&#x27;m currently in the process of teaching
about 3 more kids as well.  I always use this approach when I teach
now, because I think it lets people understand what they are doing as
they solve.

          <div class="email-content">It just seems to my naive view that learning to do a certain algorithm over
and over is maybe useful for getting faster with the hands. However, you
can&#x27;t possibly be directing a movie, you might, but for god sakes, in the
video, you don&#x27;t look more than 17 years old.
http://youtube.com/watch?v=8v6uJOxquXs
http://youtube.com/watch?v=aOiKEg3RapY
You could be directing a movie, but I just doubt it. Also, whne you were
solving, you were doing it layer by layer, which is something most
experienced cubers don&#x27;t (on the non blindfolded). BY logical thought, you
have to be a semi-advanced cuber to learn to do BLD. (Consider this from a
naive point of view). And also, you could find any of the great cuber&#x27;s
sites and just learn one thing on the OLL and PLL. (like what Shelley said)

P.S. Pancakes are yummy... That is all

blindfold video, well, it doesn&#x27;t do any favors for the credibility of
those of us who do actually blindfold solve.

P.S. I prefer waffles.

I&#x27;m sorry if you were offended by it.<br>
<br>
After that video, I had the cube lying around, so I decided to learn<br>
how to solve it (after I did, I made my second cube video &quot;The Puzzle&quot;).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve exceeded my Rubik&#x27;s Cube video quota :P<br>
This next video that I&#x27;m doing is for YouTube and for my professional<br>
reel. I&#x27;m getting a crew together (friends I&#x27;ve met at work and<br>
school) and we&#x27;re making a 5 minute short film with decent lighting,<br>
camera work, etc about a social pariah who leaves home for the first<br>
time to go to college. I figured I&#x27;d throw in a Rubik&#x27;s cube scene as<br>
a reference to my other online videos.<br>
<br>
I wanted to do a one-take shot of someone handing him the cube, which<br>
looks really scrambled, and he solves it in a really short amount of<br>
time. We did some test shots... the speeding up doesn&#x27;t look real<br>
enough, a cut defeats the purpose of the shot (ala the pursuit of<br>
happyness), and the cube looks too solved with the last layer algorithms.<br>
<br>
I might teach him one of the more complicated PLLs or something like:<br>
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; <br>
even though that doesn&#x27;t mess with some of the sides.<br>
<br>
<br>
To the people who asked,<br>
I&#x27;m 20 years old and have a full time job as a video editor.<br>
I&#x27;m shooting this in the Boston area, so (to the ones who offered) I&#x27;d<br>
be more than willing to get some help :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the suggestions, everyone!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m interested in putting up a Norwegian Open or similar soon myself, 
and this delegate thing has got me puzzled.

It would be very inconvenient if the delegates had to be chosen from 
a very small set, what with the current plethora of events. In 
addition, it says on the WCA site that the delegate to past events 
like WCs were people who also competed.

So from the wording in the regulations it seems like the WCA delegate 
may, in fact, be yourself.

          <div class="email-content">Setting it up so that he just does one thing over and over to solve
the cube will look just as fake, and it fuels the misguided notion
some people have that cubing is just knowing &quot;the algorithm&quot; that you
do over and over until the cube is solved.

I suggest you use stunt hands and do a real solve.

I`m not a really experienced cuber (well, five months), but i started out using this method. I think it`s pretty simple.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Teaching to solve the cube

Hi,

Yes this is also how I would approach it, pretty much the same as Tim.
I the T OLL and the P OLL (the two 6 move cases) to orient edges. 
Then for corners I show them R&#x27; D2 R F D2 F&#x27; and F D2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R to
orient one at a time. For sune cases they need to orient one corner
twice in the opposite direction.

For permuting corners I use commutators like R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2
R U2 R&#x27; D2 R but I call it using the &quot;storage spot&quot;. First they see
that the UFR corner is in the incorrect location (say you have the
three cycle UFR->UBR->UBL) . I tell them to take it out of the U layer
and &quot;put it into the storage spot&quot; which is the location DBL. They do
this with R&#x27; D2 R. Then I tell them to find the spot where it needs
to go, here UBR, and turn the U layer so that it is at UFR (which I
call the working location). Rinse and Repeat.

For edges same thing it&#x27;s just that the &quot;storage spot&quot; is DF after you
apply M D2 M&#x27; and they continue the same.

I have also tried to show a little more standard stuff for last layer
and I usually end up confusing people. But everyone who I&#x27;ve shown
using commutators seems to get it, and when they come back later on
they can still remember what to do - they don&#x27;t forget the moves
because they aren&#x27;t really algorithms to them.

Hope this helps. I&#x27;ve taught several high school level kids and a
couple middle school level kids how to solve using this method. I did
teach one 4th grader too, and I&#x27;m currently in the process of teaching
about 3 more kids as well. I always use this approach when I teach
now, because I think it lets people understand what they are doing as
they solve.

and I think that, by that criteria, Erik won...by something like 0.01 :)

using the following link:

http://rapidshare.com/files/64981765/LL_order_gap.txt.html

There are four nested while loops that should generate all the last
layer positions. The built-in function Order is used to compute the
order of each position, and the corresponding element of a list is
incremented in order to get a tally of the distribution.

Type: llorder(1);
in GAP to compute the result for all last layer positions.

Type: llorder(0);
in GAP to compute the result for permute-only cases.

Hi all!
I know it is a little difficult to organize a competition here in
India because not many of us have actually been to any other actual
competitions.But hey!There are people like Bernett and John Louis.We
can take suggestions from them and try and make it as good as possible.
I know it will be difficult to get a WCA official from the US or
Europe.But if is possible then it is well and good.Also can someone
like John Louis act as a WCA official? 
Anyway we will at least try have it unofficially to try and popularize
the cube here in India.
Me, Sachin and a few other cubers from IITM and may be also IITB will
be there.
Cheers
Karthik

Repatedly apply the above until that too is oriented, etc. F2L will 
be restored when all corners are fixed.

my 2x2x2 is Rubik&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s too small and not good for speed turning...and I didn&#x27;t learn (yet) any method for the 2x2x2...just FL, OLL, PLL

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I made this small, simple 3x3 rubiks simulator. This is not feature <br>
rich, but hope it can be useful somehow.<br>
<br>
note:<br>
1. To rotate whole cube x &amp; y axis: click left mouse on black <br>
background and drag it.<br>
2. To rotate whole cube z axis: click right mouse anywhere and drag it.<br>
3. To rotate part of cube: click any section, drag to next section <br>
and release it. (there will be an arrow showing part and direction of <br>
the rotation).<br>
<br>
enjoy,<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">In keeping with what has now become a tradition (despite the<br>
unpopularity of this whole idea in some quarters), I&#x27;m once again<br>
organizing the yearly Negative Time Solving Contest. The official page<br>
is at http://cubefreak.net/negative.html ,<br>

DST ends in the United States and in Canada this year at 2am on<br>
November 4 (Sunday), one week after EU summertime ends at 1am UT on<br>
October 28 (Sunday). I will NOT post the results from Europe until the<br>
results from North America come in a week later.<br>
<br>
A slight note in response to Lucas Garron&#x27;s solves from last year:<br>
Please note that each solve started (not just start the timer but<br>
actually make a move) before daylight saving ends and completed after<br>
it ends counts as a negative solve. This means that you can<br>
simultaneously compete in 3x3 speedsolve, 3x3 blindfolded, and<br>
whatever else your heart desires, at the cost of some extra time in<br>
your negative solve. I think a fun category would be &quot;most cubes<br>
solved blindfolded in a negative time.&quot; the whole thing needs to be<br>
done in an hour, so you first have to decide on the number of cubers<br>
to attempt, and then, taking into account your average memorization<br>
time for that number of cubes, start memorizing at some appropriate<br>
time before daylight saving ends.<br>
<br>
You can find instructions for sending in your times on the link above.<br>
 Once again, thanks to Tyson for bringing this great Caltech tradition<br>
to cubing. Good luck to everyone!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I also found Parker Gaitley quite quickly. I don&#x27;t know if I did it
differently to Joel or not. Just click on all persons for 2x2, then
clicked on people with an avg of above 30s, until I saw one with a
sub20 avg for 3x3! Not efficient, but I think it is the only way!

A 1 min solve in 1981 would still be considered fast. These days we 
define *speed*solving from 30 or 40 secs and down. 1 min is the time

          <div class="email-content">Generally we like to do a weekend in the summer.  It&#x27;s more convenient for
everyone, I think... especially the students and a large percentage of the
cubing demographic is between the ages of 14 and 20.  When exactly during
the summer, I&#x27;m not sure.  Of course, if we got a good deal some other time,
like a weekend in some other random month, that might be too much to resist.

Our idea at this point is the shot gun approach.  After we have our proposal
written, we&#x27;re going to fire it everywhere.  Las Vegas casinos, science
museums, Chicago again, etc...

So if you have an idea of a possible venue, let us know.  The Dallas
competition at The Science Place was a result of a one-line e-mail from
Shelley.

cheaper hotel about 20 minutes outside the city, with more
accommodations (Residence Inn).

As for location/venue, how about a place in the northeast for once?
And have universities been asked? Theme parks? Other museums?

very difficult for us.  An operation in Los Angeles would be almost trivial
for us to run.  There is a significant burden when we travel far away, and
there is a very large cost as well.

No matter where you hold a competition, some people will have to travel.
With that being said, if you could give us suitable examples of places we
could look into, that&#x27;s the only way any work is going to get done.  Time is
always limited for me, so please suggest theme parks or museums and don&#x27;t
make me go searching for these things myself.

Chicago was a lot of fun, but it did cost the club about $7,000 to run that
competition.  We would be willing to travel to organize a competition if
there is a good venue.

EUR.USD.SPOT sucks too... actually, the only thing that doesn&#x27;t suck is
JPY.USD.SPOT.

Well, the places I had in mind included the Franklin Institute

the MET (NYC), and Six Flags Great Adventure (NJ), or possibly even
one of the Smithsonian museums.

If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, how did it cost $7,000 to the club?  How much
did the venue cost?  That sounds like a very high number.

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
Someone was asking me about supercubes (actually, they asked about<br>
&quot;solving cubes with pictures on them&quot;). I was looking for a good webpage<br>
to send them, but didn&#x27;t really find anything when googling. I&#x27;m really<br>
just after some basic information and instructions.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a webpage about supercube solving, can you post the link?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t have a webpage on this topic, but I&#x27;ve practiced super cube
solving pretty extensively.  Perhaps a link to this thread would be
enough?

Supercube 3x3x3:
----------------

Easy/Beginner method: just solve as normal and use the following algs
to flip centers after you are done with the corners and edges.

Rotate U clockwise and R counter-clockwise:
U M E&#x27; M&#x27; U&#x27; M E M&#x27;

Rotate U counter-clockwise and R clockwise:
U&#x27; M E&#x27; M&#x27; U M E M&#x27;

Rotate U twice and R twice:
U2 M E&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M E M&#x27;

Rotate U twice:
R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27;

Rotate U clockwise and R clockwise:
R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; M E&#x27; M&#x27; E R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; E&#x27; M E M&#x27;

Rotate U counter-clockwise and R counter-clockwise:
R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U M E&#x27; M&#x27; E R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U E&#x27; M E M&#x27;

Rotate U clockwise and D counter-clockwise:
U M E2 M&#x27; U&#x27; M E2 M&#x27;

Rotate U counter-clockwise and D clockwise:
U&#x27; M E2 M&#x27; U M E2 M&#x27;

Rotate U twice and D twice:
U2 M E2 M&#x27; U2 M E2 M&#x27;

Rotate U clockwise and D clockwise:
R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; M E2 M&#x27; E2 R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; M E2 M&#x27; E2

Rotate U counter-clockwise and D counter-clockwise:
R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U M E2 M&#x27; E2 R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U M E2 M&#x27; E2

Intermediate 3x3 method:
------------------------

When solving the cross (I assume you solve on the D face here) make
sure the edges line up correctly with the D face center.  Solve 3
cross edges this way.  Before inserting the last cross edge use the
&quot;empty&quot; cross slot to correctly rotate the E layer centers that are
touching your 3 already solved cross pieces.  Then make sure to insert
the 4th cross piece such that it is correctly lined up with it&#x27;s
center.  When solving F2L try to not use F2L tricks that would flip an
 E layer center.  After you have done OLL and PLL, you often have to
correct the U center, and also some OLL and PLL algs will flip 1 E
layer center.  So you may need to fix 2 centers.  Use the algs from
the beginner method for this.  You should only need to use 1 alg to
fix centers at this point, unless you use crazy OLL and PLL algs ;-) 
Some algs may rotate the D center, so you may need to use one of the U
and D center flippers.

Advanced 3x3x3 method:
----------------------

I never learned this method, but hey it never hurts to come up with
theory for it anyway ;-)

For this method you directly solve the cross and the D and all 4 E
layer centers.  I did work on this quite a bit, but now I am out of
practice for it.  It is possible to do this each time with practice,
but it takes a LOT of practice.

Use supercube safe OLL and PLL algs.  Also learn additional alg sets
to solve the PLL case *and* correctly rotate the U center.

Again I never learned this method, but I did work on the first part
about direct solving the cross and the first 5 centers.

Supercube 4x4x4 and 5x5x5:
--------------------------

I assume you are solving with the reduction method i.e. solve the
centers, then the edge groups, then solve as a 3x3x3.  You can pair up
the first 4 centers exactly like you would with your normal method. 
Just be sure to be placing them together such that you are solving the
centers in the supercube sense.  No new algs are required for this,
just go slow and think carefully.  For the 5th center you can also do
this intuitively but it typically is a bit harder than the 5th center
on a regular 4x4 or 5x5.  I would recommend the use of commutators for
placing the last 1 or 2 centers for almost all cases.  However you can
still solve this center without the use of commutators, rather with
just careful thought and good technique.

For the 6th center you will need algs like these below.  If you
understand commutators just skip the section below and use your
favorite commutators to solve the last center, that&#x27;s all these algs are.

*******
ALL algs below assume you have not solved the edge groups yet.  I
would recommend to fix the 6th center before fixing edges.
*******

4x4x4 algs:
-----------
Swap Ufl and Ufr: (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr)&#x27; (Bb)2 (Rr) F&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; (Bb)2 (Rr)2
Swap Ufl with Ufr *and* Ubl with Ubr: (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)&#x27; (Ll)&#x27;
(Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) (Ll) (Dd)&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr)

5x5x5 algs: (note that lower case m,e,s moves denote only the
innermost slice, not the triple inner layer):
-------------

The first thing you need to look at is to see if you have a 4 cycle or
a 2 cycle of the &quot;+&quot; centers.  The four center pieces together with
the centralmost piece on a face that look like a &quot;+&quot; sign are the ones
I am referring to.

If you do have a 4 cycle or a 2 cycle of these pieces, this means you
have parity in the wings.  Use your standard parity alg that you would
normally use for fixing the last edge group, only you *must* execute
this alg with the 6th and unsolved center on the U face.  This will
fix the parity in the &quot;+&quot; centers.  As an example I use the alg (Rr)
U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)&#x27; U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)2

Now you may need to use one of the following cycles to fix the &quot;+&quot;
centers now that you have correct parity.  Rotate your cube or simply
spin the U layer until you have one of the cases I describe

&quot;+&quot; center algs
---------------
Three-cycles:
Cycle Usl->Umf->Usr (counter-clockwise): (Ff)&#x27; r&#x27; e r U2 r&#x27; e&#x27; r U2 (Ff)

Cycle Usl->Usr->Umf (clockwise): (Ff)&#x27; U2 r&#x27; e r U2 r&#x27; e&#x27; r (Ff)

&quot;Z&quot; perm
--------
Swap Umf with Usr and Umb with Usl: m s (Dd) s&#x27; (Dd)2 m&#x27; U2 m (Dd)2 s
(Dd)&#x27; s&#x27; m&#x27;

&quot;H&quot; perm
--------
(Rr) (Ll) U2 (Ll)&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr) (Ll) U2 (Ll)&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;

&quot;X&quot; center algs:
----------------
Now that the &quot;+&quot; centers are done we have to finish the X centers. 
Rotate your cube until you can use one of the following algs:

3 cycles:
Ufr->Ubr->Ubl (counter-clockwise): (Ff)&#x27; r&#x27; u&#x27; r U r&#x27; u r U&#x27; (Ff)
Ufr->Ubl->Ubr (clockwise): (Ff)&#x27; U r&#x27; u&#x27; r U&#x27; r&#x27; u r (Ff)

&quot;E&quot; Perm
--------
Swap Ufr with Ubr and Ufl with Ubl
(Rr)&#x27; (Dd)&#x27; L&#x27; u&#x27; R (Dd)&#x27; (Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) R&#x27; u L (Dd) (Rr)

&quot;H&quot; Perm
--------
(Rr)&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; (Dd)2 (Rr) (Ll) U (Rr)&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; (Dd)2 (Rr) (Ll)

-------------------------------------

Hope this helps and happy supercubing!

Bah I can&#x27;t believe I forgot about this move.  That shows how out of<br>

To fix wing parity and &quot;+&quot; center parity without the edge groups<br>
solved just do (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr)&#x27;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

I am guessing that these people just have a 3x3 cube with pictures..

Basically, you just need to know a 3x3 solution and some extra algs 
for solving the centers.. Like:

(R&#x27;L&#x27; U2 LR U) * 2

U (M E M&#x27;) U&#x27; (M E&#x27; M&#x27;)

It&#x27;s great that you share you ideas with the rest of the community! 
Good job on that!

Maybe you would like to consider using NxN Imagecube for making 
diagrams:
http://www.solvethecube.110mb.com/nxnimagecube.php?n=5

Possibly, net.php is also useful for displaying all 6 faces:
http://www.solvethecube.110mb.com/net.php?n=5

Just my 2 cents. Feel free to use or not use these :).

<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about writing a small solver for the 3x3 in PHP. I <br>
have *very little* experience in programming however, so I was <br>
wondering if any of you can give me advice... <br>
<br>
What would be a clever algorithm for this? I want it to be reasonable <br>
fast, but also very easy to program.<br>
<br>
Efficiency is not very important, so I could just write a very lazy <br>
algorithm based on 2 cycles (like Pochmann); easy to program, but it <br>
would result in way too many moves (quite possibly 200+). Maybe 50 move <br>
solution would be better...<br>

Ideas or suggestions, anyone?<br>

Yep! I do, I&#x27;m always that confused =)

BTW: Do you (or Petri) got the results from the Snake event from the 
competition? I don&#x27;t remember my times and those are Swedish NR&#x27;s (not 
offical doe =) so I really like to have them.

          <div class="email-content">Any cycle-based solution should be easy to program. You might need to 
bend your brain a little to figure out the setup moves though. In 
Pochmann, or M2, setup moves are straightforward - you can just 
tabulate them. In a pure-cycle BLD method this becomes harder.

I was going to say that PHP is not the way to go here, but since 
you&#x27;re not writing an optimal solver, I guess it&#x27;s ok. If you were, 
you&#x27;d have to take into account that most servers timeout their PHP 
scripts after 30 seconds or so.

Dunno how much programming &quot;very little&quot; is, so here&#x27;s more :)

I&#x27;d figure out some clever data structure to store cube positions in. 
Then I&#x27;d keep a bunch of algs, with or without setup moves (depending 
on solution method maybe - you be the judge) that can act on the cube 
(say, make an alg class and then make instances for each alg you 
need, load the notation in a constructor).

Then, the solution code should (i.e. for M2) look at the edge in DF, 
load the corresponding alg object, ask the alg to output the notation 
into a buffer, and then make the alg act on the cube. Loop. Of course 
you need to take other cases in account (is edge in DF solved? then 
break into a new cycle if there is one, or go on to corners if the 
edges are all ok.)

Hope that made sense.

          <div class="email-content">I stayed at the Congress.  One thing I wonder about Los Angeles, would
it be almost too convient?  For example, in one of the Caltech
tournaments, you had over 100 competitors for the 3x3x3, and it seems
like not many competed in other events (really there weren&#x27;t that many
other events).

It would seem like you would have to limit either the number of events
at the US Open or have really strict limits.  In Chicago, I was able
to attempt 2 averages (First round and B-final).  I would hate to get
two chances, not meet the cutoff, and then not get a chance to do
anything else for that event.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eivind,

Yes.. This was what I was planning to do with Pochmann, only I was 
hoping to be able to get other suggestions, because the movecount 
would be very high. 

I wonder how much time it would take to do brute force searches for a 
cross, then a brute force search for a F2L pair etc. (or different 
stages, and then slowly get into the 2-gen group(?)). Would that be 
possible?

I know PHP is not really the ideal language for this, but I thought 
it would be cool to offer a solution program on my website (one that 
people can just use online)... That&#x27;s why I want to make the 
movecount relatively low, while I still want to be able to write it 
in as less time as possible :).

Anyway, thanks for you help,

Joël.

Ah... good to know what it&#x27;s intended for, I wouldn&#x27;t know what 
method to suggest if I didn&#x27;t know the purpose. Now I suggest 
Thistlethwaite. Fairly easy to brute force all four steps.

On the other hand, there already are cube solving programs and you 
could just implement a web interface to one of them, if all you want 
is the result (i.e., if you&#x27;re not that interested in programming a 
solver yourself).

Cheers!

Not long. Maybe a few seconds? But it depends on the actual 
implementation. You can see some short cube solvers and statistics

3.5x10^(-6). How does that help us find the probability of a full EO
skip, which may happen even when the scrambles are outside
&lt;U,D,R,L,F2,B2> or the other restriction?

I remember a discussion here a while ago about whether or not the
scrambles as they are generated now give about the same distribution
for the number of correctly oriented edges as a truly random cube. Did
we actually answer that question? (We shouldn&#x27;t even be having this
conversation if it was.)

A full EO skip has already happened in competition, by the way. The
first solve from Caltech Spring 2005 had all edges correctly oriented
(using restriction &lt;U,D,R2,L2,F,B>).

          <div class="email-content">I think this is actually a problem if the average scramble currently
generated for competitions have some attributes that are distinctly
different from that of an average scramble chosen randomly. A method
suited to the average competition scramble would have an unfair
advantage over other methods.

I bet that the difference is small enough that we can ignore it for
all practical purposes, but it still bugs me a bit. Would a true
random scramble take too long to generate?

For example, we could have a program generate a random 11-digit binary
for EO, a random 7-digit trinary (?) for CO, and somehow produce a
random permutation of both corners and edges so that each one is
generated with equal probability. The cube configuration defined from
these informations could be thrown automatically into an optimal cube
solver, which would spit out the scramble. This way we&#x27;ll never have
to worry about scrambles being dependent on the way they are generated.

To me it doesn&#x27;t matter how small the difference is. It shouldn&#x27;t be
there, and it bugs me a lot that we are solving positions that are
easier than average.

> Would a true random scramble take too long to generate?

Not at all, and this has been discussed several times already. I don&#x27;t
know why it&#x27;s not the official way to scramble.

I wasn&#x27;t looking for the probability of a full EO skip, just showing
that when scrambling this way it&#x27;s much more than it should be.

If that number really is wrong then my calculator and computer
aren&#x27;t working.

The answer was that 25 moves is not enough to give a fair
distribution. But apparently nobody seems to care.

I think that for now we should make random-position-generation (i.e. through <br>

Such a scheme could be allowed for other puzzles but may be optional.<br>

Note that the current regulations allow random-state-generation as long as <br>
the scramble produced from it exceeds the regulated scramble length.<br>

Having said what I&#x27;ve said, I agree that we should switch scrambling<br>

with, say, Cube Explorer is that the solutions tend to be less than 20<br>
moves, so scrambling would be quicker usually.  I guess a drawback is<br>
that scramblers would be harder to program: now, anyone with minimal<br>
programming experience can write one, whereas a near-optimal solver is<br>
needed to write a good scrambler with this scrambling method.<br>

Interesting way to look at it. I confirm your computation, btw. Macky 
needs a new computer or shouldn&#x27;t do calculations in dvorak. And I 
add that the resulting EO skip probability is actually above that, 
while the desired probability is far below it, namely 0.00049 (1/
2^11).

Cheers!

I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s obvious.  Your first point in particular, if
you do 1 turn, solved isn&#x27;t the most likely.  If you do 2 turns (the
way that scrambles are generated, so no R R&#x27; etc.), solved isn&#x27;t the
most likely.  If you do 3 turns, solved isn&#x27;t the most likely.  I
understand that it is possible to have a 25 HTM identity while it
isn&#x27;t possible to have identities of 1,2, or 3 moves, but why is
solved the most likely outcome?  And why does that lead to solves of
lower depth?  And, even if it does, why are solves of depth 15 or 16
&quot;easier&quot; to speedsolve or blindfoldsolve than solves of depth 18-20?

Oh man, I just realized that you meant 0.0019 ((14/18)^25) or
0.0019=(14/18)^25. That, I swallow, and also agree with Stefan&#x27;s
observation that the actual probability of a EO skip must be larger
than this (because of the reason I also mentioned earlier).

I don&#x27;t know how much larger, but we clearly have a problem then. Any
programmers willing to make a scrambler?

Cube Explorer already is a scrambler. Click &quot;Random&quot; and &quot;Add and 
Generate&quot; once for each scramble you want. Then &quot;File ... Print All 
Cubes&quot;.

If I remember correctly, the reason why the WCA doesn&#x27;t do this yet 
is that it&#x27;s less comfortable and portable than the javascript 
scrambler currently in use, which simply runs in a web browser and 
produces scrambles instantly.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Maybe you can make a video of you doing a few solves, and make it sure 
that viewers can actually see what you are doing. That way, people 
(tthat includes me) can give you comments on that. 

Other than that, simple search for &#x27;tips&#x27; on this site. Cubers have 
been repeating the same tips a lot, and they usually apply.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not the kind of person monitoring the<br>
webtraffic everyday, but since I&#x27;ve been making a few changes on my<br>
website this week, I was interested in looking at the visitors again. <br>
<br>
Funnily enough, in the past month, I had 2000 visitors from the US,<br>
who spend 3 minutes on my website on average, 10 visitors from South<br>
Afrika, who spend 20 minutes on my site on average, and 1 visitor from<br>
Nigeria who spend 38 minutes on my website on average :D. I also had a<br>
visitor from Adis Abeba, Kenia! I NEVER get hits from Afrika...! <br>
<br>
The Japanese are KING at leaving my site quickly; most people are<br>
polite enough to at least look at what is the result of my hard work<br>
for just 1, eins, uno, one, Ã©Ã©n minute, but the Japanese are out of<br>
there after 51 seconds! Maybe its because of the language?<br>
<br>
Anyway, the peak at the end of each year seems to be beginning now,<br>
probably influenced by the WC07. Now look at the Google Trends:<br>
<br>
http://tinyurl.com/2bpqzn<br>
<br>
The question is, will this years peak exceed the one in 2006? I bet<br>
that it will!<br>

What visit counter are you using? Google Analytics? That&#x27;s what i use 
for some webpages for work. I get an excellent overview of any 
trouble there may be with the sites/pages by analysing the traffic 
that way :D

Have fun :-)

of the Pursuit of Happyness, which came out around that time. That

I kinda expected another spark after the worlds, but I guess I was
wrong. Well there is a little bump up, but I expecting a sharp increase. 

What reasons do you think caused sparks at the end of each year?

I usually see a definite spike around Christmas time and New Year. I
assume this is because lots of people get cubes as Christmas presents,
and usually have some time off around Christmas/New Year and so are more
likely to spend time surfing the net for cube info.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve always thought that it&#x27;s obvious. If you start from the solved<br>

&gt; &gt; position you&#x27;ll end at. And (more importantly) the average depth will<br>
&gt; &gt; be less than it would be for random positions.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s obvious.  Your first point in particular, if<br>
&gt; you do 1 turn, solved isn&#x27;t the most likely.  If you do 2 turns (the<br>
&gt; way that scrambles are generated, so no R R&#x27; etc.), solved isn&#x27;t the<br>
&gt; most likely.  If you do 3 turns, solved isn&#x27;t the most likely.  I<br>
&gt; understand that it is possible to have a 25 HTM identity while it<br>
&gt; isn&#x27;t possible to have identities of 1,2, or 3 moves, but why is<br>
&gt; solved the most likely outcome?<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have any theory to back me up, it just feels logical to me.<br>
It&#x27;s very possible that I&#x27;m wrong here.<br>
<br>
But anyway, this doesn&#x27;t really matter. The significant bias in EO<br>
distribution alone should be enough to show that 25 random moves<br>
isn&#x27;t a good enough way.<br>
<br>
&gt; And, even if it does, why are solves of depth 15 or 16 &quot;easier&quot;<br>
&gt; to speedsolve or blindfoldsolve than solves of depth 18-20?<br>
<br>
Why wouldn&#x27;t they be? But I&#x27;ve also got a &quot;proof&quot;: a while ago I ran<br>
a simulation, and the optimal solutions for the first step of Petrus<br>
method get longer and longer as the length of the scramble increases<br>
(and it continued after passing 25 moves, IIRC, but I&#x27;m not sure where<br>
I saved the results and in any case I&#x27;ll redo this in a more suitable<br>
language).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know this might be nit-picking, but I get that the probability of<br>
only double turns on 2 opposite faces (or possibly no turns on one or<br>
both faces) from a 25 move random scrambling algorithm is closer to:<br>
<br>
(1/2)*(14/18)*(11.667/18)^24 = 1.17*10^-5 or 0.00001<br>
<br>
This is still only an approximation of the actual probability because<br>
for the first move you have the option of choosing a turn on one of<br>
our 2 restricted faces or one of out 4 non-restricted faces.  Choosing<br>
a turn on a non restricted face means that for your following turn you<br>
have now only 11 possible turns to choose from.  If you choose a turn<br>
on one of our restricted double-turn only faces than for your next<br>
move you have only 13 possible choices for your next turn.  Also you<br>
have to disallow scrambling algs like U D U D U D U D U D U D U D ...<br>
which can occur on your restricted faces (as F2 B2 F2 B2 ...) or on 2<br>
unrestricted faces.  What I did for my calculation is to take the<br>
weighted average of 11 and 13 with 11 occuring 2/3 the time and 13<br>
occuring 1/3 the time for the number of choices of each successive<br>
move after the 1st turn.  This is not the true probability, but only a<br>
closer approximation than (14/18)^25<br>
<br>
To be honest I don&#x27;t yet know how to calculate such a probability<br>
precisely, but I am now very interested in this type of question so I<br>
will try to look into it.  For our math gurus does anyone know how to<br>
find the exact chance of only double turns, or possibly no turns on<br>
one or both of any pair of 2 opposite faces from a scrambling algorithm?<br>
<br>
Either way I think (14/18)^25 is a bad approximation because it allows<br>
for scrambles like (if you restict quarter turns on F and B):<br>
B2 R L F2 R R&#x27; R2 R R R&#x27; R2 R R R&#x27; R2 F2 D U2 R R&#x27; R2 R2 R2 R2<br>
<br>
and it also allows for scrambles like (with only double turns on R and<br>
F, two adjacent faces):<br>
R2 F2 R2 U D L&#x27; D2 F2 R2 B&#x27; R2 U2 F2 R2 F2 L&#x27; R2 D U2 F2 R2 F2 R2 D R2<br>
<br>
Although I don&#x27;t know the exact probability I get that it is much<br>
smaller than 0.0019 for this case, which in my opinion is stronger<br>
evidence for something like a random state generator scrambler for<br>
BLD, and probably also for 3x3x3 speed.  Is there a way to make a web<br>
based version of Cube explorer&#x27;s scramble function?  Or to somehow<br>
integrate Cube Explorer into a web app from someone&#x27;s server?  This<br>
probably sounds like a dumb newbie computer question because it is ;-)<br>
but with odds like the ones we are dealing with I also am in favor of<br>
changing how we scramble for BLD for 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
This also affects 5x5x5 BLD too, and I&#x27;m sure there must be some side<br>
affect for corner orientation as well so it can affect 4x4x4 BLD as<br>
well, though only on a very limited scale.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; The probability to get a scramble like that (no 90 degree turns on <br>
&gt; two<br>
&gt; &gt; faces) is approximately 0.0019 ((14/18)^25, should be close to<br>
&gt; &gt; correct).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Interesting way to look at it. I confirm your computation, btw. Macky <br>
&gt; needs a new computer or shouldn&#x27;t do calculations in dvorak. And I <br>
&gt; add that the resulting EO skip probability is actually above that, <br>
&gt; while the desired probability is far below it, namely 0.00049 (1/<br>
&gt; 2^11).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok I have to ask the dumb question.  Looking at this again from the
standpoint of evidence for or against using a random state generator
to scramble for 3x3x3 BLD it seems that our scrambling is not actually
so bad.

If the probability is close to 1*10^-5 for a scramble to have no
flipped edges (no quarter turns on 2 opposite faces) from a 25 move
scrambling algorithm and in actuality it is 1/2048 from a random state
generator or 0.0005 then our scramblers are producing scrambles with
no flipped edges only 1/50 the time as a true random state generator
should.

So in fact our scramblers are making our scrambles harder from the
viewpoint of the EO stage than a true random state generator would.

Am I missing something?  Does anyone know the actual probability of a
current 25 move scrambler producing such a EO free scramble so we can
stop using approximations?  It seems that in fact our scramblers are
giving us harder scrambles than a true random generator would, at
least as far as EO goes.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t understand your calculation. I tried a quick simulation and it
got numbers much closer to my approximation than yours, but I will
check my one-liner and read your message again.

Yet another thing that confuses matters is that there isn&#x27;t one single
way to generate random moves, some people don&#x27;t allow L come after R
for example. I allow both orders.

The point you are missing is that of course there are other scrambles
that give solved EO, too (temprorarily disturb it, and restore later).

Also see message #34941.

So far, the peaks at the end of each year seem te be higher 
everytime, which is why I thought that this years peak will also be 
bigger than last year. As Jasmine Lee pointed out, this has to do 
with people getting it for Christmas and having some more time to 
surf the web and search for info about it.

However, I totally forgot how the Persuit of Happiness influenced 
last years peak. That&#x27;s a significant difference of course... It

          <div class="email-content">Hi Johannes,

> 100,000 JNet scrambles:
> {41, 0, 2764, 0, 22444, 0, 44173, 0, 26360, 0, 3970, 0, 248},

I have to admit I don&#x27;t understand what those numbers mean.  I get 
that 41 is the EO number, but what does the 41 itself mean?  41 of 
the 100,000 cases had solved EO (no flipped edges)?

The EP number certainly can&#x27;t mean that you had a solved edge 
permutation, what do the permutation numbers measure?

As to my calculation, please don&#x27;t hold me to that number exactly as 
it in itself is an approximation because I don&#x27;t know how to 
calculate such a complicated situation precisely.

My thinking was this.  (14/18)^25 has 2 very major flaws in 
reasoning.  For one it allows multiple turns of the same slice in a 
row, stuff like R R&#x27; R2 R R&#x27; even to the extreme of 25 turns on the 
same face.  The larger problem is that it would allow exactly 2 
turns of the same face in a row during a scramble, which occurs with 
far more frequency that silly cases like 25 turns on the same side.

The second flaw in reasoning is that it does not count the 
probability of restricting no quarter turns to two opposite faces 
only, it only finds for simply 2 faces.  This means you can restrict 
moves on 2 adjacent faces, which can still leave flipped edges in 
the end.  There are 12 ways to choose 2 adjacent faces to restrict 
and only 3 ways to choose 2 opposite faces to restrict.  So this 
probability is already counting 5 times as many cases as it should 
due to allowing restrictions on any 2 faces and not just 2 opposite 
ones.

Actually looking at this further in depth my calculation does have 
an error then.  When choosing the faces to restrict there is not a 
1/2 chance of choosing 2 opposite faces but actually 1/5.  Assume 
the centers are fixed in space (we scramble with white on top and 
green front as standard).  There are 15 ways to choose 2 faces to 
restrict, but only 3 of those choices are choices of 2 opposite 
faces so I should have used 3/15 instead of 1/2.

So my initial approximation had an error.  I would actually get

(1/5)*(14/18)*(11/667/18)^24 = 4.7*10^-6 or 0.000005 which is even 
smaller of a chance than my previous calculation by a factor of 2.5

If this is off from the theoretical distribution I imagine it comes 
from the term (11.667/18)^24 which is my way of trying to 
approximate the fact that the number of choices of possible turns 
after the very first turn of the scramble depends on if you just 
turned one of your restricted faces or one of your unrestricted 
faces.  By restricted face I mean one of the ones where you are only 
allowed to turn double turns.

If my calculation is wrong I am willing to look at it again and try 
to correct it.  But I still find those 2 major flaws for (14/18)^25 
so I don&#x27;t think we should use that as our approximation of the 
probability.  (14/18)^25 is a greater probability than the actual 
one for this type of scramble because it overcounts for 2 different 
reasons, both of which I mentioned above.

Thanks, that will surely help and inspire me :).

Also, I&#x27;ve looked into Thistlethwaite a bit more, and it&#x27;s quite 
interesting. I also found Ryan Heise&#x27;s Humans Thistlethwaite. Could 
it be possible to define more steps in between the 4 subgroups, to 
make the solution longer but the algorithm faster?

Click on &quot;its results&quot; under &quot;3x3 scramble analyzer&quot;.

And here&#x27;s yet another approximation: Whatever scrambles you allow or 
forbid, unless you favor one axis over another we can expect 1/3 of 
all turns to be F or B. Each of those turns has a 1/3 probability of 
not being a quarter turn. So the probability to never get quarter 
turns on F or B should be about:

(1/3) ^ (25/3) = 0.000106 = 1/9463

The general flaw in this of course is that with higher number of 
moves we can make the result of this and the other formulas 
arbitrarily small, because they don&#x27;t take into account &quot;restoring&quot; 
edge orientation.

Cheers!
Stefan

It&#x27;s certainly possible, though I haven&#x27;t thought about that before. 
But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.

I did the first step today... It already finds algorithms to orient 
the edges to get into the first subgroup &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,D2> :)... Which 
also means that some important functions are already written :).

One thing that kinda shocks me, though, is that it take a while.. I&#x27;ll 
try to finetune some settings. And play around with it.

Hmm, that first step should be by far the fastest, so if this is 
already slow, you might be in trouble. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time but 
if you show the code I (and maybe others) can have a look and maybe 
help find at least obvious slow parts if there are any.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Well, maybe I can do that later..
For now I like to play around with it myself.

One of the problems is that I basically simulate the whole cube
(using functions I wrote a long time ago) which isn&#x27;t really needed 
for checking only EP.. Maybe that takes some extra time?

In some cases, it finds quick solutions in 2 seconds, but Erik gave 
me a 10 flip, and that took longer than a minute!!

I should also note, that I am only using quarter turns and no R2,L2 
etc. for this step. Could that be an important detail?

          <div class="email-content">That is exactly where i am stuck.  my problem is recognizing OLL/PLL 
and i take too much time to intuitively solve F2L.  yes, i have tried 
slowing down (ALOT), and succeed when i go really slow, but as soon as 
i try and speed up, i have to pause to recoginize.  my questions: is 
there an easy way to better recoginize OLL/PLL then just having to slow 
down? and will i be faster if i memorize F2L algs rather than try and 
solve each pair intuitively (which takes about .5-1 second to recognize 
each pair)?

thanks, and i hope this helps aili too

          <div class="email-content">I think these are the kinds of things that just comes with practice. 
Keep at it and your recognition times will drop eventually. There are 
only that many OLLs, PLLs and F2Ls, and every time you solve a cube 
you improve your ability to recognize just a little bit.

 I am guessing that these people just have a 3x3 cube with pictures..
 
 Basically, you just need to know a 3x3 solution and some extra algs 
 for solving the centers.. Like:
 
 (R&#x27;L&#x27; U2 LR U) * 2
 
 U (M E M&#x27;) U&#x27; (M E&#x27; M&#x27;)
 
 Joël.
>From my limited experience &#x27;solving&#x27; the edges is significantly more work than solving the faces. I programmed a solution of the 5x5 and found that solving the faces wasn&#x27;t too difficult and that was placing 54 cubies (or it could be viewed as moving the 48 cubies to the six fixed sides). On the other hand the 24 wing cubies had to be mated to their corresponding 12 edge cubies and that was a whole new level of challenge. The resulting 3x3 equivalent cube is easily solved but the edges were the real challenge.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again,

Since I asked for the videos, I thought I should give some comments:

1. It looks like you are using your &#x27;full hand&#x27; to twist the U face 
sometimes. This looks sluggish, and indeed slows you down. There&#x27;s 
many way&#x27;s to do U2 without grabbing the whole layer. I call 
this &#x27;screw-driving&#x27; btw. And like a great man once 
said: &quot;Speedcubing is a more like playing a piano rather than 
screwdriving&quot;. This applies to all triggers. RUR&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27; and all that 
stuff. It&#x27;s twice as slow when you use your whole hand to do the U 
move, rather than just the left or right index finger. Especially 
also pay attention to the left index finger. 

How do you perform RUR&#x27;U&#x27;? I would guess that you don&#x27;t use the left 
index of U&#x27;. IMO; It&#x27;s a perfect opportunity to let your hands 
cooperate!  (I could be wrong about this btw... I saw you using your 
left index a few times...)

2. It looks like you are sometimes using d&#x27;/d without know where 
this is leading. If you are looking for pieces, I recommend doing 
U&#x27;/Us and peeking behind the cube without regripping. 

3. The F&#x27; and F in the Y perm should be done without regripping the 
cube. Practice triggers like R&#x27;FRF&#x27; and other combinations like this 
while holding the cube in the &#x27;standard&#x27; grip (whatever that 
means ;)).

I guess that&#x27;s enough for now. Oh.. I have a tips page:

http://www.solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=tips

Good luck!

Joël.

Well, the Thistlethwaite 52-move algorithm and Ryan Heise&#x27;s &quot;Human
Thistlethwaite&quot; algorithm both divide stages 2, 3, 4 into two
sub-steps each.

But I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re wondering about using &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B2> in
between &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B> and &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2>, &lt;U,D,L,R2,F2,B2> in between
&lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2> and &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2>, and &lt;U,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2> in
between &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2> and &lt;U2,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2>. I would say no
because &lt;U,D,L,R,F,B2>=&lt;U,D,L,R,F,B>,
&lt;U,D,L,R2,F2,B2>=&lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2>, and
&lt;U,D2,L2,R2,F2,B2>=&lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2>. (This was easy to confirm using
GAP.)

You could consider other in-between groups like:
&lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2,R U2 D2 L&#x27;> in between &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2> and
&lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2>, but I think at least Ryan&#x27;s sub-steps are
essentially doing this same sort of thing.

          <div class="email-content">Jeff, for OLL I got a tip (I use the same stuff for COLL while doing 
VH/ZBF2L)

When putting down the last pair, look at the OLL-case &quot;all ther 
way&quot;. Most turns used to put in the last pair does not change much 
of the last layer. So you can start to look at the case while doing 
the pair.

I do the same thing for PE while ending my COLL, I actually know my 
PE-case almost all times before COLL is done. But PE is wery easy to 
spot, guess it&#x27;s harder to do for PLL, but still useful.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I didn&#x27;t mean subgroups.. But I have some ideas for this. An example 
would be to orient the corners by searching for moves to have 2 
oriented corners at DLF and DLB, then seaching for 2 gen (RU) to 
orient the other ones. Should be quite fast, because it will only 
search for algo&#x27;s with R and U. But I am working on that now :).

I am basically going to do a similar thing for the edges orientation 
(don&#x27;t worry, *not* with 2-gen :p), since the brute force search I 
use now is a bit too slow, I think. I&#x27;ll break it up into steps that 
are only 3 or 4 moves away :).

Oh yes.. I do this with PLL a lot. I often know when its a J or N. And <br>
with many algs, you can smell in the middle of the OLL that it&#x27;s going <br>

When solving COLL, you need to first do the F2L and orient the last
layer edges.  Your edges aren&#x27;t oriented.  The UB and UR edges are
flipped.  Do some searches on VH or ZBF2L to figure out how to orient
these edges efficiently while you are solving the F2L.

If we ignore that problem and just look at the corners, you can see
that this is the COLL triple-sune (L) case.  This is because there are
two diagonally opposite corners that are correctly oriented, and the
other two corners are not oriented.  You need to do a U&#x27; move first to
make the face line up the same as Bob&#x27;s diagram.  Next, look at the
first two non-yellow stickers in the left and right columns.  In your
case, it looks like this:

Blue   Blue
Orange Red

Because Blue occurs twice, use it as your F color.  When Blue is in
front, orange is on the left and red is on the right, so these
stickers are rewritten as

F F
L R

This matches case #13 on Bob&#x27;s page.

I have a feeling that your brute force is way too brute.

I don&#x27;t think so, better to use intuition and a LOT of practice.

That way you will in time find the moves and grips that suits you the 
most.

Before this topic dies, let&#x27;s try to get something going toward making
this change. Can anyone do what Chris is suggesting here? Like I said
before, actually making a scrambler as practical as the current
official scrambler is the fastest way to convince people to make this
change.

I&#x27;d like to give it a shot, but I don&#x27;t really have time at the 
moment.

Knowing me though, if I get sufficiently interested, I might just 
take my time. :P

I started writing a solver in JavaScript yesterday. It&#x27;ll of course
never be as practical as the official scrambler because the move count
will certainly be higher than 25, but I&#x27;ll at least be using it for my
unofficial solves.

1. PHP doesn&#x27;t easily run in a browser. You&#x27;d have to have PHP 
installed. Not good.

2. Even if he implements Thistlethwaite without breaking down the 
steps further, expect an average of 31.3 moves. Not good. Though, he 
could go on searching for better algs, just like Cube Explorer does. 
But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;ll help much, and it&#x27;ll take even more time 
(both to run and to implement).

Cheers!

Hi Eivind,

My PHP cube solver is going to take a while to finish, and it&#x27;s not 
going to be anything special. It&#x27;s not going to be very practical 
either.

It would be more practical to generate random cube states that we 
can then input into Acube or cube explorer to get scrambles :). 

I really like the idea of using a solver to scramble it&#x27;s way into a 
(pseudo)random position.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Instead of &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; with a PHP solver IMHO it is a 
better idea to turn ACube into a webapplication by making it an 
applet and adding a nice GUI. I see more potential in this 
personally :-)

Yes i know abut Ryan&#x27;s page to assist in setting up ACube input, but 
it does not implement ACube itself. We would need Josef&#x27;s permission 
and cooperation (?) to proceed with this ...

Stay twisted :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
A funny thing happened me tonight, and the subject of this thread is <br>
the first thought that popped into my head when it did ;-)<br>
<br>
Tonight I had to run some papers to a coworker at home for some <br>
advertising things for the business I work for.  I was at work and <br>
she gave me the directions over the phone and I wrote them down on a <br>
sticky note with the intention of taking it with me.  I had to wait <br>
about 20 minutes to talk with customers before I left, and when I did <br>
I forgot the sticky note with the directions!<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t realize this until I was already driving to her house <br>
though.  Rather than go back and get the directions I decided to try <br>
to remember the note.  I pictured the sticky note on the desk next to <br>
the keyboard where I had written it, and slowly but surely the image <br>
of my handwriting and the directions on the note came back to me.  <br>
Eventually I was able to recall the entire note and made it to her <br>
house!<br>
<br>
The route was along roads that I am not very familiar with, and I had <br>
to take 7 roads to get to her house from work, in addition to <br>
remembering the house number.  This is less information than a 3x3x3 <br>
cube for which I average 10 images.  Still it was close enough to a <br>
3x3x3 cube solve that it made me laugh.<br>
<br>
So yes, BLD cubing can actually help for things in the real world ;-)<br>

Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been trying a different approach this morning, and it finds an <br>
algorithm for the 1st phase in about 1 or 2 seconds now. It&#x27;s a lot <br>
less brute now :).<br>

<br>
If you live in the Chicago area or would be willing to travel here, <br>
for a November 6-7 trade show (costs can be covered), read on. A <br>
company is looking to pay someone to come to a trade show and be <br>
their cubing expert.  Since I&#x27;m only 30 miles out of Chicago, I would <br>
consider it, but I am fresh out of vacation time.  I did a trade show <br>
once in the past and it can be fun.  It sounded from the original e-<br>
mail (somewhat trimmed, below) that compensation was at least <br>
somewhat negotiable.<br>
<br>
Anyways, if you are interested, please respond to this e-mail <br>
address.  Unfortunately, I do not stay up to date with the Yahoo <br>
groups, so if you only respond to the group, I might not notice in <br>
time (sorry).  I will send you their contact information as quickly <br>
as I can, if you are interested.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you read the rules official sport stacking rules
http://tinyurl.com/25au9h in the section Stackmat: Positions you will
see that they require you to start and stop with the hands, any
portion above the wrist and up to the fingers.

So this particular run is a scratch (DNF) because he didn&#x27;t stop with
his hands.  Also this run is doubly a scratch because his hands were
in contact with the cups as he stopped the timer.

That&#x27;s like a DNF *and* a pop for 3x3x3 BLD right as you stop the
timer ;-)

That kid is really really good though, so I imagine he&#x27;ll pull some
awesome time in competition assuming he doesn&#x27;t get nervous.  But that
particular run is a scratch for 2 separate reasons.

I&#x27;m sorry. I tried really hard, but failed. You&#x27;re probably too far 
away for me to read your mind and find out what you mean with noisy.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
My PHP solver is just about finished. It&#x27;s really nothing special, <br>
and the code got pretty messy, but I am so glad that it works, that <br>
I just wanted to share this :).<br>
<br>
I just tested with 10 pseudo random scrambles, and the average move <br>
count of the solutions was 56 moves. The solutions range from 50-60, <br>
with some lower and higher scores.<br>
<br>
The script can be found here (there is no link on my home-page yet):<br>
http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=solver<br>
<br>
If you want to generate a string with 54 letters (to use as input), <br>
you can go here:<br>
<br>
http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=view<br>
<br>
Enter a scramble, click the radio button &quot;GENERATOR&quot;, and click go!. <br>
On the bottom of the page you will find a sticker code that you can <br>
use as input for the solver.<br>
<br>
You can also use these, if you like:<br>

owbyryrrowryggobrybywywwwworrggowbgrwbgobbgoyobgoygybr<br>
<br>
About the script: I am very happy that I managed to make this <br>
script. I learned a lot from it, and I have plenty of ideas about <br>
how to make it better, if I were to do it again!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Nice work, Joël : )

I tried this scramble: (x2) D&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L2 R U2 B R&#x27; D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; R2 B2 L R&#x27; B2 U F&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; B L2 R2 D2 L2 (x2)

and it gave me this:
B U F2 L&#x27; F&#x27; U L D&#x27; U R U R2 U R&#x27; U R&#x27; U2 F2 B2 D&#x27; R&#x27; U2 D2 L D L2 R2 B&#x27; F&#x27; D2 B F&#x27; R2 L2 U2 R2 L2 R2 L2 U D&#x27; F2 B2 F2 R2 D&#x27; L2 R2 U L2 F2 U D2

the statistics say &quot;Total (including cancelations)               53&quot;

if I understood correctly, it &quot;knows&quot; there are cancelations but it&#x27;s not cancelling the moves...is it that?

if so, why wouldn&#x27;t you do it? O.o you can cancel some parts there, like
...U2 R 2 L2 R2 L2 U...
and
...D&#x27; F2 B2 F2 R2...

and get 53-4-2 = 47 moves :)

or did I understand it all wrong?

 My PHP solver is just about finished. It&#x27;s really nothing special, 
 and the code got pretty messy, but I am so glad that it works, that 
 I just wanted to share this :).
 
 I just tested with 10 pseudo random scrambles, and the average move 
 count of the solutions was 56 moves. The solutions range from 50-60, 
 with some lower and higher scores.
 
 The script can be found here (there is no link on my home-page yet):
 http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=solver
 
 If you want to generate a string with 54 letters (to use as input), 
 you can go here:
 
 http://solvethecube.110mb.com/?location=view
 
 Enter a scramble, click the radio button &quot;GENERATOR&quot;, and click go!. 
 On the bottom of the page you will find a sticker code that you can 
 use as input for the solver.
 
 You can also use these, if you like:
 
 byrorrggwbogwgoowyyobywbggrrrobobgyobgyrbwwboygwwyyrrw
 owbyryrrowryggobrybywywwwworrggowbgrwbgobbgoyobgoygybr
 
 About the script: I am very happy that I managed to make this 
 script. I learned a lot from it, and I have plenty of ideas about 
 how to make it better, if I were to do it again!
 
 - Joël.

          <div class="email-content">None the less, I felt my 2x2 was quite a bit better (albeit still
lousy) after lubing.  I used my regular silicone lubricant and just
sprayed into 3 orthogonal  faces in the dead center with one of those

It&#x27;s still not very good, but I found it to be an improvement.

The notation that my algorithm viewer supports is a lot simpler than 
the applet. I didn&#x27;t feel need to code it so it recognises 2&#x27;, 
because R2 and R2&#x27; are basically the same. You can only add 1 extra 
symbol to a move, either &#x27; or 2. The information IS transported to 
the applet though, which does support R2&#x27;.

You read my mind.

I didn&#x27;t put the link to the solver on the main page yet, because I 
want to make it more user friendly, and add these features, such as 
an applet and a description of the notation, and quite possibly a 
more n00b-friendly notation.

Yeah, you are right. I got tired of all the scripting at the end, so 
I just uploaded the script, but I can still adjust it and modify it a 
bit. In this case, it cancels U&#x27;U2 for example, but not sequences 
like U D U2. I&#x27;ll work on that.

By coincidence, I found that R2&#x27; does work (which I believe is a 
more common notation than R&#x27;2 anyway). Both the applet and image 
respond correctly to this.

I know it looks very unproffessional, but Cube Explorer give R R&#x27; as a
solution to a solved state... 

I just thought it would be funny to have an identity algorithm for a
solved state... And.. Also, this is what cube explorer gave me for
this situation (believe it or not).

The method is:

1. Orient edges
2. Orient corners &amp; bring E layer edges in E layer
3. Separate U/D layer pieces, first corners, then edges
4. Permute everything (first E layer, then U and D layer simultaneously).

I know it&#x27;s not Thistlethwaite... The brute force searches were taking
too long (my fault, I know, inexperienced in this sort of
scripting/programming), so I decided to try a different approach. Now
that I am finished, I some ideas about how to do faster searches, but
don&#x27;t feel any need to start writing that now. I am just happy that it
works.

I didn&#x27;t realise you came to this group! 

Maybe I only notice it just now, because I&#x27;ve been working with cube 
explorer recently. Anyway, cube explorer rocks!! Great program. I 
also used to to generate solutions for a few cases for my solver.

          <div class="email-content">I was by Macky to post something to this site, so here goes.<br>
<br>
It all started because I was speaking with a co-worker one day about<br>
the rubiks cube and how I had never figured out how to solve it.  Well<br>
he convinced me to take Macky&#x27;s challenge:  &quot;07/09: I&#x27;d like to see<br>
someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to solve a cube learn to solve it<br>
blindfolded. Would some brave soul please give it a try? It really<br>
shouldn&#x27;t be too hard. You&#x27;d be the only person in the world who can<br>
say, &quot;I can solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but only blindfolded&quot; (ok, of course<br>
you can use the blindfold method with you eyes open, but you know what<br>
I mean).&quot;<br>
<br>
Well last night I finally successfully solved the cube for the first<br>
time and it was blindfolded.  There were many failed attempts before<br>
that, and I started in July shortly after the challenge.  So it only<br>
took me ~4 months to get a completed solve.  Now in my defense, I have<br>
a wife and 2 kids (8 year old and a 16 month old), so I was only able<br>
dedicate a few hours a week to this.  Plus I was very slow in actually<br>
memorizing the algorithms.  <br>
<br>
The experience was both fun and frustrating at the same time.  The<br>
frustrating part was of course thinking I had it solved then looking<br>
at the cube and seeing it just as scrambled as when I started.  The<br>
funny thing is I have trouble looking at the cube now as I do the<br>
algorithms, as I had forced myself to practiced all of them with my<br>
eyes closed.<br>

Execute the algorithms on a scrambled cube and track all the 
stickers?

+ Hope that you dont accidentally get into the solved state, of 
course. That would suck, if you tried Macky&#x27;s challenge ;).

Congratz on your first solve, though, Jeff ;)

          <div class="email-content">Actually, i would recommend you use this tutorial, simply because it
uses pre-existing algorithms from the fridrich method:
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/

Then, once you understand it (and can solve it consistently
blindfolded), switch to the M2/R2 method.

I didn&#x27;t know in Speed stacking that if you record it, you have the
world record. Maybe it&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t be faked as well.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

I shot the video myself, because Rama told me this guy was stopping 
like this all the time. It didn&#x27;t look like the judge knew art. A6c 
of the WCA regulations; nothing happened really. Kai also told me 
that this person always stops the timer this way. It&#x27;s not a big deal 
to me; I doubt that it saves time, but when we have rules, it&#x27;s a 
good thing they are enforced properly.

Do you know if anyone ever got a 2 second penalty for stopping the 
timer with wrists in an official competition?

What if i just want to give the solver a scramble, not a sticker

Yes, that&#x27;s the way to do it...

Possibly, I can add a text field that allows you to input a 
scramble. It should not be very hard, since most of the functions 
are already written. It&#x27;s a good idea... (Basically the 2nd example 
already does this, it just generates a random scramble).

So thanks for the suggestion, maybe I&#x27;ll add that sometime.

Maybe it&#x27;s possible to condense certain moves? For example, F B F = 
F2 B? I noticed this in the example solve you gave.

          <div class="email-content">One of the first things I had to do was be able to recognize the colors
for each of my positions.  I used the numbering scheme on
http://www.cubefreak.net.   I chose blue as my top and green as my
front, mainly because the  java app on http://www.cubefreak.net had the
cube oriented that way and it was easier for me to visualize what the
algorithms were doing and what it should look like when it was done.

I practice the algorithms on both a solved cube and a scrambled cube. 
Practicing means I was looking at the algorithm on a cheat sheet and
executing them on the cube under the table.  Of course I looked after I
had executed the algorithm to see if I done it right.  If I ended up
scrambling it accidentally while practicing an algorithm on a solved
cube  (which happened quite a few times) I had co-worker, Mike Hughey
solve it for me.

Initially I stared with only the corner algorithms until I had those
algorithms memorized.  I even tried solving just the corners on a 3x3,
which I guess technically was a blindfold 2x2.

Then I worked on edges which took me a while, but I didn&#x27;t try just
solving the edges on a scrambled cube.  If I needed the cube solved I
gave it to Mike and he solved it.

When I was actually trying to solve it blindfolded and failed, Mike, who
is very patient, would solve it so I could scramble it again.  Initially
I was just messing it up randomly, then he pointed me to JNetCube which
I started using.

Of course technically I could after having memorized all the algorithms
(or just some of the really key one) could have solved it sighted, I
just didn&#x27;t solve one unless it was blindfolded.

It happens, but its not nearly as bad as the kid. he *WAS touching the
cups when he stopped the timer, where the guy did release the cube. 

I didn&#x27;t know in Speed stacking that if you record it, you have the
world record. Maybe it&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t be faked as well.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joel :-)

It is quite easy to code so that you transform for instance R L R2 
to R&#x27; L. Code a sequence tokenizer with axial control. You have the 
first part anyway. Assign RL FB UD to same axes.

Example:

Sequence: R L2 R U2 D2 U&#x27; ... (R2 L2 U D2 ...) 

Steps: 

R > add to RL axis - RL[1]=1
L2 > add to RL axis - RL[2]=2
R > add to RL axis - RL[1]=2(1+1)
(switch here ... output from RL >> R2 L2, empty the axis too!!!)
U2 > add to UD axis - UD[1]=2
D2 > add to UD axis - UD[2]=2
U&#x27; > add -1 to UD axis - UD[1]=1 (2-1)
(switch ...)

I promise you, this is EASIER to code than a solver ;-)

I tried your scramble again; 

(x2) D&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L2 R U2 B R&#x27; D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; R2 B2 L R&#x27; B2 U F&#x27; D&#x27;
R&#x27; B L2 R2 D2 L2 (x2)

it now gives a 46 move solution, because of more cancelations.

Per, I added the option to put in a scramble.

Bye!!

<br>
I have a question that one of the other math tutors asked me at the <br>
math center I work at.<br>
<br>
The question was, is there a way to solve the following equation <br>
algebraically?<br>
<br>
3^x + 4^x = 7<br>
<br>
What I mean by this is can you solve this simply by manipulating the <br>
equation, or converting it to an equivalent problem in another branch <br>
of mathematics (elliptic curves maybe?) and thereby derive the answer <br>
x=1?  Our tutor, who studies at University, asked his professor and the <br>
professor said you would most likely need to solve it using numerical <br>
methods, or with a calculator or computer.<br>
<br>
This also leads into the question of how many solutions are there to <br>
the above equation if you allow x to be a real number, or if you allow <br>
x to be a complex number?<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to look at this problem I don&#x27;t think there
are any solutions to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 7 where x is a complex
number (a + bi).

If you let x be a complex number then
3^x + 4^x = 7 turns into

3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln(4)))

In order for this to be a solution I want to get rid of the terms
involving the sin() function and the i.  But to do this I would need a
real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi while
simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple of 2*pi.

There is the trivial case where b=0 but then the value of x isn&#x27;t
really a complex number.

Am I right in my reasoning that there is no solution to this equation
among the complex numbers, or is there an error in my reasoning here?
 I am assuming that because the exponential functions 3^x and 4^x are
one-to-one that there is only 1 real number such that 3^x + 4^x = 7
and therefore any potential complex number solution must use this somehow.

Thanks,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Obviously there is a real number solution (x=1) such that
3^x + 4^x = 7. This is trivial. It&#x27;s too long since i did complex 
numbers at uni so i cannot really help you out on this one with 
complex numbers. I&#x27;m pondering the possibility of 2 real solutions, 
one other where x is negative. Hmm ...

Can we generalise any conlusions for other equations:
a^x + b^x = c^x (where a+b=c) ??

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think a real solution with x &lt; 0 would exist.  The function y
= 3^x + 4^x is strictly increasing (also continuous and > 0). So y is
one to one from R to {x in R | x>0}, which means it should only have
one real solution to y = 7.

I looked at the solver again. Now it looks very good!! I, like Stefan 
did, wonder what is the solution strategy. I can see you do orient 
all then permute all. What i dont understand is: what exactly is the 
separation stage? And is your approach similar to what Zbibniew 
Zborowski (or Ron) has been doing??

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: (off topic) solving exponential equations


Hi :-)

Obviously there is a real number solution (x=1) such that
3^x + 4^x = 7. This is trivial. It&#x27;s too long since i did complex
numbers at uni so i cannot really help you out on this one with
complex numbers. I&#x27;m pondering the possibility of 2 real solutions,
one other where x is negative. Hmm ...

Can we generalise any conlusions for other equations:
a^x + b^x = c^x (where a+b=c) ??

          <div class="email-content">Dan is correct here. Lucas is correct with using numerical methods 
to obtain the other complex solutions. The original eqution is 
highly non-algebraic so there&#x27;s really no good way of attacking it 
manually. Although what Chris started doing with expanding it with 
x=a+bi (sometimes x=r*e^(i*theta)) is a standard way of approaching 
it, but it tends to be a dead-end, as well as insufficent for 
obtaining the entire solution set.

Chris: It seems to be like you are being asked a lot of impossible 
questions, or questions of an inappropriate level at your job. I&#x27;ve 
found it best to flag these out as quick as possible, give a brief  
explanation, and move on to something more productive. Many 
questions in math don&#x27;t lead to anything satisfing I&#x27;ve found. 
Unless of course you want to be a math professor, then you have to 
know everything, both the good and the bad.

Erm... can&#x27;t brush it off by saing things like that never show up 
either. I suppose equations like that DO unfortuantely show up in 
physics or engineering sometimes, but this is what we have an entire 
field of &quot;Numerical Methods&quot; for... Not the most beautiful branch of 
mathematics I&#x27;d say.

          <div class="email-content">There is nothing wrong with using Petroleum Jelly I think. It&#x27;s 
incredibly inert too (hence safe for the plastic). But I don&#x27;t see why 
a well placement of any other lubricant wouldn&#x27;t stop spring creak 
noise either.

If it&#x27;s acting sticky then you are probably using too much. Just take 
it apart and wipe off the excess. A little bit of it goes a long way, 
especially if it&#x27;s coated nice and evenly. When it starts doing this 
adding a few drops of water might help too. The polar/non-polar 
combination is fun to play with I&#x27;ve found.

Cool!  It&#x27;s neat to see that there are complex number solutions to <br>
this equation!  Also, and I ask this because I haven&#x27;t really studied <br>
complex numbers in much depth before, are there 2 and *only* 2 <br>
complex solutions to this equations?  It appears from your graph that <br>
perhaps there could be an infinite number of solutions?  Or am I <br>
incorrect here?<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; 3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln<br>
&gt; (4)))<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In order for this to be a solution I want to get rid of the terms<br>
&gt; &gt; involving the sin() function and the i. But to do this I would<br>
&gt; need a<br>
&gt; &gt; real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi <br>
while<br>
&gt; &gt; simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple of 2*pi.<br>
<br>
*puts foot in mouth*<br>
<br>
Ok I see my error in reasoning here.  After distributing I can also <br>
get rid of those terms with an imaginary part if<br>
3^a*i*sin(b*ln(3)) = -4^a*i*sin(b*ln(4))<br>
<br>
This actually gives a system of equations to find any complex number <br>
solution (a+bi):<br>
1) 3^a*i*sin(b*ln(3)) = -4^a*i*sin(b*ln(4))<br>
2) 3^a*cos(b*ln(3)) + 4^a*cos(b*ln(4)) = 7<br>
<br>
&gt;From this system of equations I would guess that there are an <br>
infinite number of complex number solutions.  The real part of any <br>
complex number solution to this equation would have to stay the same <br>
I&#x27;m thining, but the imaginary part b, because it is contained <br>
withing the sin and cos funtions, can take on an infinite number of <br>
possibilities since those functions are periodic.<br>
<br>
I probably worded that very poorly, but I think you see what I mean.<br>
<br>
Doug I also appreciate your comment too about not worrying so much <br>
about these types of questions.  I did personally find it to be an <br>
interesting question, which is why I posted it, but in the big scheme <br>
of things that is true I guess it doesn&#x27;t really apply very well to <br>
us only having to tutor up to high school level students ;-)<br>

Between magic and master magic, I judged 5 people, my dad judged 7,
Bob judged 3, Mitchell&#x27;s dad judged 4, someone else (the signature
does not look familiar at the moment) judged 3, and Jaclyn (Bob&#x27;s
girlfriend) judged 1 person.

So most of the people were judged by either me, Bob, or my dad.  In
the future, I would have only us judge the magic events, just to make
sure.

step 1: 4 corner pair edges, just like the fridrich method(minus the <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I have already try this method(without knowing CLL), and it seems<br>
you forgot a step.<br>
step1: 4 pairs minus the cross<br>
step2:CLL<br>
step3:you said &quot;simultaneosly solve the edges of the top and bottom<br>
layers&quot;. I think that isnt clear enough, if you mean just orient U and<br>
D edges, then you still have to put them in their correct layer with<br>
another step.<br>
then your 4th step could be an edge permutation(which permute U and D<br>
edges). <br>
<br>
There are some things I remember from this method:<br>
<br>
First, when you have solves your 4 F2L pairs, your centers could be in<br>
a bad place. then you have really unfair moves to do. If you place<br>
your centers correctly, then the method is like a Roux Method but it<br>
ends with 8 edges(contrary to Roux&#x27;s method which end with only 6<br>
edges). Your 8 edges could be oriented using only UMD moves( only MU<br>
moves for Roux&#x27;s one).<br>
The other thing I remember is that algs used to permute U and D edges<br>
(for example the one you need when you have to do a Z-PLL on both U<br>
and D faces) are maybe not very long, but to my mind very unfair to<br>
recognize.<br>
<br>
So my point of view is that this method is very close to Roux&#x27;s<br>
one,BUT you don&#x27;t have more freedom when you build your 4 F2L pairs<br>
than when you build 2 1*2*3 blocks. So you should maybe solve DR and<br>
DL edges after your step2, in order to follow Roux&#x27;s method and<br>
simplify your last step which is too complicated to be achieved in<br>
speedcubing.(Maybe this method could be fine in FMC but the slice<br>
moves are very bad for that...).<br>
<br>
To conclude, in my opinion this method isnt really better than Roux&#x27;s<br>
one, and Roux&#x27;s one is (maybe) easier to recognize.<br>
<br>
PS:btw if you dont forgot a step, your step4 means you permute all U<br>
and D edges when they are oriented but you dont know if they are in<br>
their correct layer...If I remember, there are tooooo many cases to<br>
learn...tooo many to be efficient if I remember...<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope my answer can help you, tell me if I&#x27;m wrong or if I forgot<br>
something.<br>

A couple of other people have also come up with the same idea
recently. Nobody found it efficient, though.

          <div class="email-content">If it pops, tighten the screws (really nothing else to do). If it 
then turns too tightly, I suggest you work it in for a few days (even 
DIYs need this IMO). After that you can lube it.

cube4you.com sells some DIY kits of various types, which have gotten 
good reviews from reliable cubers. I really haven&#x27;t paid attention to 
the development in this area, so maybe someone else can fill us in.

If your cube pops all the time, that means it&#x27;s too loose.  You just have to tighten it up until it doesn&#x27;t pop all the time on you.  You can still have a fairly loose cube without it popping.

I saw a new cube version at a game store today called the Rubic&#x27;s Ice Cube.
Anyone heard of it? It is a 2*2*2 cube but transparent. Does anyone know if
it has any additional features like lights?

            These don&#x27;t seem to be recorded in the WCA record database. Is there a

way to find out what solves were +2&#x27;ed from some previous

competitions? Sometimes these penalties affect the ranking and who

advance, so I think it&#x27;s a useful information to have saved.

course, but I guess we can&#x27;t do too much about that.

I think I&#x27;ll start keeping track of which of my solves had penalties.
Poor Sunil.

the other day and as i was superglueing the tiles on i got some glue<br>

unstuck, and somehow i managed to break a center piece in the process<br>
as well as having 4 of my center caps disappear somehow. If anyone has<br>
some extra parts or knows of where i can get some spare parts (i<br>

          <div class="email-content"> I think all will agree that 25 half turns (of totally 25) in a scramble is a bad scramble. 24 is slightly better. And 23 is still better. Common sense tells me that this tendency (i.e. bettering the scramble) will go on all the way, as the number of HT goes towards zero. But obviously I´m mistaken; there is a consensus amongst makers of scrambling algorithms that the optimal scrambling is recieved, when the number of HT is in average one third of the given length. Can anyone explain to me (simply) the reasoning behind this value?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was trying a few days ago to make up a solution for the 4x4x5 and
the 5x5x4 simulated on the 5x5x5, which are both in the group
&lt;U,u,D,d,R2,r2,L2,l2,F2,f2,B2,b2>.
Then I noticed that if you combine both solutions, you came up with
the whole 5x5x5 solved.

So here is my method :

1st step : make the F, B, R, L centers.

First, make two opposite centers (this is quite easy).
Then for the two last, first solve the center-corners : using this
algorithm of mine :
(FBL BDR) : Uu2 R2 Uu F2 r2 F2 Uu&#x27; R2 Uu2

Then solve the center-edges using this already known alg :
(FR BR) : r2 U2 r2 Uu2 r2 Uu2

2nd step : make the FR, FL, BR, BL edges.

For this step, I turn the cube to have these four edges on the M slice.
First, I make two half pairs, by using r/r2 (which solve a half pair
in UF) U2 B2 U2 B2 r&#x27;/r2.

To complete these 2 pairs, I use a 3 cycle :
(UFR DFR DBR) : U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr U2 Rr&#x27; U2 Ll U2 Rr&#x27; U2
Rr U2 F2 Rr F2 Ll&#x27; Rr2 U2
Then for the last two pairs, I use a combination of :
(UFL UBL) : Rr2 U2 Ll U2 Rr&#x27; U2 Rr U2 F2 Rr F2 Ll&#x27; Rr2
(UFL UFR) : Rr2 B2 U2 Ll U2 Rr&#x27; U2 Rr U2 F2 Rr F2 Ll&#x27; B2 Rr2

3rd step : make the U and D centers. This is easy !

4th step : make the U and D edges. This is quite easy if you know how
to solve 4x4 edges, you just have to use half turns (like Rr2 U R2 U&#x27;
Rr2). For the last two edges, you may need this alg (thanks to Matyas):
(UFL UBR) (UFR UBL) : Rr2 Ff2 U2 r2 U2 Ff2 Rr2

5th step : solve the U and D layers
Now this is a domino solve, I personally solve the bottom layer, fix
the parity (using R2 U2 R2 U2 R2), then I use T perms with setup moves
to finish the top layer :
(UL UR) (UBL UFL) : R2 U&#x27; R2 U R2 y R2 U R2 U&#x27; R2 D

6th step : solve the middle layer edges.
This can be done easily, I&#x27;m so lazy I won&#x27;t explain this :)

That&#x27;s it !
Any comments/suggestions ?

<br>
Some things I noticed:<br>
- Judges pulling the cube cover when lifting it, resulting in the cube<br>

(A3e1?)<br>
- Judges calling DNFs as +2&#x27;s and vice versa (10f)<br>

- Judges not knowing that OH solves are to be inspected with one hand<br>
(C1a)<br>
- Judges not knowing the two-tile Magic DNF rule (10g)<br>

I think all will agree that 25 half turns (of totally 25) in a scramble is a <br>
bad scramble. 24 is slightly better. And 23 is still better. Common sense <br>
tells me that this tendency (i.e. bettering the scramble) will go on all the <br>
way, as the number of HT goes towards zero. But obviously Iï¿½m mistaken; <br>
there is a consensus amongst makers of scrambling algorithms that the <br>
optimal scrambling is recieved, when the number of HT is in average one <br>
third of the given length. Can anyone explain to me (simply) the reasoning <br>
behind this value?<br>

Do a 60 degree turn of the tip so you can see the bottom of the tip
On the bottom of the tip, look for a small line parallel to the outside of

Pry, cut, slice, etc to destroy the glue that is on that small line.
You can now lift the top of the tip (really!) and reach the screw that holds 
the bottom of the tip in its place.

Dear all,
I have been asked to write about my experience in cube championships for a school magazine. Could you please share some jokes related with cube ?

One amateure cuber told a speed-cuber :- He solved a cube 5 sides several times. But the last side was the one he found difficult to solve !!!!

          <div class="email-content">Inexperienced judges at Caltech were probably nothing like those at
Pleasantville, I am quite sure that two of our judges at Pleasantville
were younger than the age of 10 years!

Regarding them, one &#x27;raced&#x27; 2x2x2 against the Pyraminx competitors,
and the other just was incapable of being a good judge. The former
didn&#x27;t pay attention to the competitor, and the latter just missed
simple things like covering the cube (and instead of using the score
card, ran to the scrambling table to get a cover). They were nice and
all, but there should be some discretion when accepting volunteer judges.

Also, most of the judges at Pleasantville were parents. They did a
very good job for the most part, but they just didn&#x27;t know some of the
rules (listed above). I think in all future competitions, there should
be something for all judges before the competition to teach them some
of the procedures and rules.

I&#x27;m not trying to bash the Pleasantville competition; I think it was a
very good competition, except for this one aspect. Also, I think
everyone appreciated the enthusiasm that all the judges there had, but
there was just a lack of knowledge of the rules by the judges, there
and also at Caltech (from what I hear), that I think it is problematic.

          <div class="email-content">Hi you all,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve already know Stefan&#x27;s old BLD method, so I decided to learn the<br>
M2/R2. I love it, I fully understand it and I&#x27;ve already know it&#x27;s<br>
algorithms.<br>
<br>
The question is the next: In my old method I memorized the edges<br>
first, then corners, then solve corners, parity, and edges.<br>
This is good for me, because I have words for edges (and building<br>
sentences during memorization), but corners only a letter:<br>
1, A, 10 is the first corner (depend on its orientation)<br>
2, B, 20 is the second, etc.<br>
so, the corners&#x27; memo is pretty fast and solving right after that is<br>
also fast, without hesitation and thinking, just do the letter&#x27;s<br>
algorithm. (1 = UFR, A = FUR, 10 = RUF, 2 = UFL, etc)<br>
<br>
But M2/R2 if I see it well, it&#x27;s prefered to solve the edges first (at<br>
least in Stefan&#x27;s examples). I know I could start with corners, just<br>
like before, but in this case, if I have parity, I have to do an R2<br>
move between solving corners and edges, and the last parity algo is<br>
also different (r2 U&#x27; r2 etc -&gt; M2 U&#x27; r2 etc)<br>
<br>
So, what do you recommend for the memorization and solving order for<br>
M2/R2?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Actually, if you&#x27;re using R2, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what you start with.  The parity fix that 
Stefan uses fixes centers while fixing the R edges.  If you do use corners first, just make 
sure that you put the edges back to what they were initially before soling the edges.  
Then, at the end of you&#x27;re solve, you have to do an R2 before doing the parity fix.

I memo edges than corners, but solve corners then edges, for the same<br>
reason as you do. (Fast corner memo followed by fast executation.)<br>
Yeah, and when parity occurs I have to do R2 before moving on to the<br>
edges, and also change the parity alg, but it&#x27;s worth it. (However, I<br>
use &quot;r2 F2 [N-perm] F2&quot; instead of Stefan&#x27;s alg.)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve noticed too that many competitors don&#x27;t know the WCA rules.  Some<br>
of them may just be Rubik&#x27;s enthusiasts and not even know how to use a<br>
Stackmat timer.  You can&#x27;t have these people judging.<br>
<br>
You can always pull competitors to do judging, but some competitors<br>
may not like that.  Some people practice constantly between their<br>
solves.  While it&#x27;s still good according to the rules, people may not<br>
like the competition.<br>
<br>
At the Minnesota Open, we had a few non-cubers who were judging.  They<br>
did a pretty good job for the most part, but you could tell they<br>
weren&#x27;t experienced. We did have some experienced people, but they<br>
were needed for scrambling.<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is that if you&#x27;re going to a competition, tell<br>
the organizer in advance if you&#x27;ll be able to judge or scramble. <br>
While they could always draft you in an emergency, they&#x27;ll be glad to<br>
take your help.  If you&#x27;re coming with a parent/friend/spouse who<br>
isn&#x27;t cubing, teach them how to judge before you go and let the<br>
organizer know you&#x27;re bringing someone who can help.<br>

          Now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to look at this problem I don&#x27;t think there
are any solutions to the equation 3^x + 4^x = 7 where x is a complex
number (a + bi).

If you let x be a complex number then
3^x + 4^x = 7 turns into

3^a*(cos(b*ln(3))+i*sin(b*ln(3))) + 4^a*(cos(b*ln(4))+i*sin(b*ln(4)))

In order for this to be a solution I want to get rid of the terms
involving the sin() function and the i. But to do this I would need a
real number b such that b*ln(3) is an integer multiple of 2*pi while
simultaneously b*ln(4) is also an integer multiple of 2*pi.

There is the trivial case where b=0 but then the value of x isn&#x27;t
really a complex number.

Am I right in my reasoning that there is no solution to this equation
among the complex numbers, or is there an error in my reasoning here?
I am assuming that because the exponential functions 3^x and 4^x are
one-to-one that there is only 1 real number such that 3^x + 4^x = 7
and therefore any potential complex number solution must use this somehow.

Thanks,
Chris

I am using 6-pairs at once. first slice is the first 3 pairs, and when
you return the slice you pair up another 3, so total of 6 pairs

However, the incidents mentioned were not included.  I spent the

rely on competitors to address these issues as they happen, not weeks
later.  If a judge is making such a mistake, it needs to be brought to
the main judge or delegate&#x27;s attention immediately.  I was judged by
one of the younger judges, but he followed all the correct procedures.
 Tim conducted a training session for the judges at the beginning of
the competition while I was setting up the timers.

a public forum when they gave the organizers no chance whatsoever to
address the problem.

          <div class="email-content">I only brought the issue up because I have heard that these incidents
occurred at Caltech as well, and therefore is not specific to a
particular competition.

However, there is a problem when neither judge or competitor knows the
pertinent rules. From what I have seen, the more experienced cubers
don&#x27;t watch other competitors unless they are friends or notoriously
good (i.e. very experienced cubers). Therefore, it would be difficult
to catch some incidents, due to a lack of knowledge of the rules.

Also, from the competitor&#x27;s standpoint, would you not think that it
would be awkward to talk about a judge where he or she would be able
to hear you?

I did try to help the younger judges as they needed, but in
retrospect, I feel that they did a better job than some of the older
judges!

I think the person that called the cops was jealous that he couldn&#x27;t

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that&#x27;s true, though Rowe was most certainly in the library, while
Sam probably wasn&#x27;t.

I don&#x27;t really make much of this, I mean, if the police took this
seriously they would have actually come in and maybe gone into the
library, where they would have found Rowe wearing blue jeans and a
black hat and they could have talked to him.  Seeing as they don&#x27;t do
anything about it until publishing it in the police blotter in a
newspaper over a week later, I don&#x27;t think this was actually anything
that matters.

and i made one by peeling all the stickers off of a cube and gluing on<br>
washers, sandpaper, small thin hex nuts, etching in crosses, drilling<br>
holes for each side (the last side was blank). It&#x27;s a bit hack, but<br>

I figure if you cut them short and hammer them in, then drip in a bit

screws/nails/bolts/etc.

 I don&#x27;t think that is necessarily good, but it is the way things<br>
are.  <br>
<br>
  If you think about that for a little, why is voting mostly done<br>
anonymously? I always thought voting should be seen as a positive<br>
vote for something/someone, not as a negative vote against the<br>
other(s).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Voting is done in secret so that you can&#x27;t be intimidated to vote one
way or another.  You don&#x27;t necessarily have to bring it up with the
offending judge.  I would encourage anyone who notices something to
let me know about it immediately.  Otherwise, how are we to improve?

I put a word document in the files section of the group that shows 
it. The document is &quot;re 4x4 pairing up edges.doc&quot;  It looks as if it 
only takes an extra twist or so to set it up.

In reality, it would be a hassle to try and get thumbnails of all
competitors to post them.  If people take pictures and put up reports,
hopefully they&#x27;ll note the names there.

          <div class="email-content">That is essentially it.

It&#x27;s different to tell a judge while he/she is judging, or immediately
after the solve, but when the judge is significantly older than you
are, it is hard to imagine that he/she would take you seriously.

Moreover, it is insulting to talk about someone else behind his or her
back, especially within earshot. But that is an issue of personal
beliefs; some people would feel bad about criticizing or complaining
about someone else, whereas others would not for doing so - I belong
to the former group.

You don&#x27;t have to tell the offending judge directly if you don&#x27;t feel
comfortable doing so. But do tell the organizer/head judge at least.
It&#x27;s a lot easier to fix things that way.

          <div class="email-content">I know how intense a competition is for a person show shares his time 
between being an official and being a competitior since I have been 
organising quite a few competitions. A lot depends on volunteering 
judges and that experienced competitors take the responsibility to 
help inexperienced judges. 

The key issue is how the WCA reacts on all these incidents. What is 
more important: That WCA acknowledges in principle all competitions, 
including those which are run in a joyful, &quot;amateurish&quot; and 
responsible way, or that WCA acknowledges only fewer official 
competitions in which all rules strictly are applied? 

Bottom line: Shall we have fun or shall we be serious?

&gt; I&#x27;ll keep that in mind for future competitions. I&#x27;ll take it that any<br>
&gt; and all judging incidents are to be dealt on an individual basis, then?<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I&#x27;d much rather that you bring up any incident at all that might<br>
occur.  If you tell a judge they&#x27;re doing something wrong, there&#x27;s a<br>
few possibilities:<br>
1) They are a parent or something that&#x27;s not a cuber at all.  In that<br>
case you&#x27;re the expert and they&#x27;re not, and they should listen to you.<br>
 They&#x27;re just donating their time to help, I think they&#x27;d probably<br>
want to do it right, not mess up the competition.<br>
2) They are a competitor with a weak knowledge of the WCA regulations.<br>
 This is quite common, and has been the case in a number of east coast<br>
competitions; I remember specific instances at Captains Cove, Rutgers<br>
Spring 07, and Pleasantville.  They are doing what they can to help<br>
out, but as competitors, they really should know the rules, and as<br>
judges, they really really should know the rules.  So I don&#x27;t think<br>
that&#x27;s a problem.<br>
3) They are a competitor who thinks they know exactly what they&#x27;re<br>
doing but don&#x27;t, in which case you need to tell them to stop them<br>
making more mistakes.  They&#x27;re a peer; whether they&#x27;re faster or<br>
slower or the same, they&#x27;re still your peer and should listen to you.<br>
<br>
If a judge makes a mistake, then tell them.  If you don&#x27;t tell them or<br>
the organizer then the judge will make the same mistake over and over<br>
again.  If I were a judge and I made a mistake on my first competitor<br>
and they politely corrected me, I&#x27;d have no problem with it.  If I go<br>
the whole day messing up every time before being told I&#x27;m making a<br>
mistake, I&#x27;d feel terrible.  So as soon as you see a mistake,<br>
especially if you know the regulations really well, let them know.<br>
<br>
And tell the organizer and Delegate too, especially if you see a<br>
mistake happening repeatedly.  If the same mistakes are being made<br>
over and over, they need to address it publicly, otherwise the<br>
competition could just fail miserably from a lot of invalid solves and<br>
things like that.<br>
<br>
One problem I had at Pleasantville is that I was unaware of most of<br>
the judge problems that occurred until people started complaining<br>
online in the week after.  There was absolutely nothing I could have<br>
done when I didn&#x27;t know there was a problem, and I can&#x27;t go back in<br>
time and tell the judges what they&#x27;re doing wrong.  So, please, at<br>
least tell the judges when they are doing something wrong, and if you<br>
feel you need to, tell the organizing team/person.<br>

          <div class="email-content">OK, so my dad got some more information on this, and while I probably
shouldn&#x27;t reveal anything more than what was printed, we&#x27;re now
entirely sure that Rowe was not the person they thought stole whatever
it was, or anyone else at the competition for that matter. 
Furthermore, the police report says the man was seen shortly after
walking away from the church.  So that&#x27;s why the police didn&#x27;t go in
the building, because the guy had been seen outside the church.  Okay.
 So neither Rowe nor Sam is wanted by the Pleasantville Police
Department, nor is anyone else at the competition.

Clarification about my &quot;Why?&quot;: I didn&#x27;t think you meant behind their 
back, but telling someone else while the judge is present (in 
contrast to not). And I fully agree with Tim, if judges make mistakes 
then they should be told immediately. If I&#x27;m a judge and make a 
mistake, I want to know.

A suggestion for competitions: I&#x27;ve always known the rules fairly 
well, but sometimes even I was unsure about a detail. But I didn&#x27;t 
have the rules with me so I couldn&#x27;t read them. Every competition 
should have the rules printed out and hanging somewhere where 
everybody can easily find them. Actually this should be a requirement 
written inside the rules themselves and I&#x27;ll suggest this in the WCA 
forum in a moment.

Cheers!
Stefan

That has been the normal procedure for the last competitions in 
Sweden and Finland. (not hanging doe, but on a table in the 
scretariate)

 That only works well if you also travel around the world to<br>
competitions like you and I seem to do.  <br>
<br>
 I have met a lot of cubers that already knew me, but I had no idea<br>
who they were. The inverse has also happened. I didn&#x27;t recognize<br>
Macky at worlds because I had never seen his picture anywhere.  <br>
<br>
 Nicknames on fora even complecate the matter more. ExoCorsair turned<br>
out to be Jon Choi, Masterofthebass turned out to be Dan Cohen. If you<br>
only know a nickname, how are you supposed to search for a picture in<br>
the WCA-database?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, speaking as a person who has done 11 consecutive years of 
science fair (mostly chem and bio), and frequently placed... BAD IDEA.

This sounds very dead-end-ish to me. It might do for a 50 minute talk 
in say some sort of math club or a mini-lecture in computer science, 
but as a science fair you can&#x27;t do much on it. I&#x27;ve found that the 
general science fair judge is not terribly keen on &quot;computational 
sciences&quot;, which is technically the category this would fall under.

If it&#x27;s not too late, come up with soemthing else, and if you still 
want to proceed, you should specify what grade level this would be for 
so that we can better guide you.

Btw, nifty site you linked.

Good idea to test the fastest method?

          <div class="email-content">I really don&#x27;t believe there is a &#x27;fastest method&#x27;; assuming the
method is reachable within the human brain capacity. God&#x27;s algorithm,
the shortest way to solve any state of the cube, would be the fastest.
Of course, and that is physically impossible. 

If you are talking about the common speedcubing methods, it really
boils down to who the user is. If that person practices alot, he/she
would get faster.

I just solved this one in 4.68 seconds.

My solution:

LD RB BU UR RF BD LB UL FL RD DF FU  BRD UBL DLB RBU ULF RUF DRF LDF

I&#x27;ve let ACube optimize for quarter turns and stopped it at depth 16. 
Until then, 24q was the best it found:

My computer is too slow and I need it for other stuff now anyway. So 
here are my two new ideas, maybe someone else wants to try them:

Orient all edges and solve DF and DB with R&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; U F2 (can be 
executed as y F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U L2) and then solve the rest in &lt;L,U,R>, for 
which ACube&#x27;s input is this:

430 DR UF UR BR DF FL DB UL DL FR UB BL BUR RFD BLU FRU DBR BDL LFU 
FLD

Solve the DBL 2x2x2 with L2 F&#x27; L R&#x27; B&#x27; and the solve the rest in 
&lt;U,R,F>, for which ACube&#x27;s input is this:

510 LF DF RU RD UF FR DB DL RB UL UB BL LUB BUR DRF UFR FUL RDB DBL 
FLD

Cheers!

Update: I mailed Danny, clarifying that Erik doesn&#x27;t just solve the 
cube but has the official world record, and he replied that indeed he 
thinks that&#x27;s not notable. I admit I didn&#x27;t know Wikipedia&#x27;s 
notability guidelines and maybe what&#x27;s notable for us really isn&#x27;t 
considered notable for Wikipedia. So I apologize for my outburst. 
Though, I still feel that that deletion reason phrase was rather 
ignorant and insulting. Oh well, whatever. It&#x27;s not like Wikipedia is 
where cubers look for information about cubing. Kinda like the 
Guiness book.

Your original reaction was correct. Danny is an idiot and is clearly
out of his depth. While it is clearly not &#x27;notable&#x27; to solve a rubik
cube (especially if one is simply following instructions provided by
someone else) that does not begin to have relevance to someone who
holds a world&#x27;s record for speed cubing. The cube actually has
mathematical depth and it is disappointing to see someone who seems
almost certain to be without any mathematical sophistication casting
aspersions on activities associated with it.

It will probably be deleted again because the guy is watching the 
page. At least for a while, better you wait a week or two and then 
try to recreate.

Or go to the &quot;village pump&quot; and make complains, that is probably the 
best way because then all sysops of the wikipedia will have their 
chance to decide if the page is &quot;of importace&quot;, not just this 
(jealous) guy.

(I wom&#x27;t do it myself if one wonders, I have done my works at 
wikipedia, about two years, thosand of pages, was a sysop at commons 
and sv, newer again =)

          <div class="email-content">At times I&#x27;m big into contributing to Wikipedia.

I would not delete such a page if it were me. I would recommend 
putting it back up and seeing what happens as Pat said. However I do 
see why a person would want to delete it, and I wouldn&#x27;t asssume 
jealousy or bad intenions. I don&#x27;t think it would be an interesting 
page to have there though, unless it&#x27;s more than a few sentances 
long. As it was, it barely qualifies as a &quot;stub&quot;, and stubs 
shouldn&#x27;t exist for too long. Either someone else needs to add a lot 
more to it, or after a certain period of time it needs to be deleted 
once again.

The deletion-cycle is part of everyday Wikipedia... survival of the 
fittest articles!

btw... if there is any hint that the page was put up by Erik 
himself, it certainly should be killed, as that violates the policy. 
In addtion, if it was all first-hand research then it should also be 
deleted. Be unbiased, and place the proper references and you&#x27;ll 
have a better chance pal.

Faster than what exactly ?? It is not too hard for a half decent 
cuber to come up with a mehtod faster than a real beginners method. I 
strongly doubt his method was any different than a slight variety of 
one of the today &quot;commonly known&quot; methods. If he didn&#x27;t publish it 
anywhere then the method most likely died with him ... R.I.P

Would those that are misquoted and referred to in this article please
speak with the author? From a raw writing standpoint, this thing is
barely readable. The English level here resembles something very
similar to what ended up in the toilet after a nasty losing battle
with food poisoning.

I actually read this article earlier, but I was so confused, that I
thought I was simply tired and would examine it in the morning. Maybe
I misunderstood the 20 second memorization of the 5x5x5 cube...

But there are several things that need to happen here.

1. The newspaper needs to be informed that this article, ignoring all
the facts, is a piece of junk.
2. The people who the article refers to need to let Wendy know that
she butchered everything.
3. The people who were in this article need to be very careful when
giving interviews.

As much as I&#x27;d like to blame Wendy Solomon for this, as practitioners
of this sport, we are responsible for being absolutely clear in
explaining what we do. Be prepared for the same dumb questions. Be
prepared for the same uneducated responses. If you&#x27;ve talked to
someone who doesn&#x27;t clear, you can pretty much predict with accuracy
that rivals quantum theory what the next response will be.

So, please... take responsibility. Be careful in your explanations,
be alert for possible misinterpretations, and understand that
sometimes people aren&#x27;t as smart as you are.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I do not see any reason for being so upset about this article. Apart 
from getting many facts wrong i think it is actually well written. 
One cannot expect a newspaper to get an article like this correct 
wrt all the facts. This article is off putting only to those already 
actively cubing and watching the community closely i guess. For 
those still only half interested i think this article may actually 
be inspiring for some. What is the purpose of a newspaper article 
about cubing? Getting all the facts correct? That&#x27;s an illusion!!

Enjoy!!

Yesterday I was interviewed for an article in a Germany-wide 
university magazine and I requested they let me proofread the article 
before it gets finalized. So that one should become flawless. Too bad 
it&#x27;ll be German.

Cheers!

It is very very cool!! I&#x27;m not worried about the stickers because I 
don&#x27;t plan on opening it.  You would be crazy to actually use this 
cube.  The cool thing about it is the box and the stickers!, 
otherwise it is the same cube you could get at wal-mart for $9.

          <div class="email-content">&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s basically four steps. You get the four edge pieces on one<br>
side, then you fill in the first two layers, then you get the top<br>
side all one color, which is called orientation of the first layer,<br>
or OFL, for short.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dang, I knew I should have learned OFL right from the beginning.... <br>
Why was I so stubborn???<br>
<br>
;-)<br>
<br>
Although I am upset that some people will now think it&#x27;s possible to<br>
memorize for 5x5 BLD in 20 seconds, I do think the overall message of<br>
the article to people who know nothing about cubing is positive (which<br>
is good).  One other good thing is that intermediate and beginning<br>
cubers who read this article may be inspired to avoid the mistakes of<br>
us older cubers by actually learning all the OFL algs and not skipping<br>
over them ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Per that this article, while terrible, is not very much
worse than any of the other articles you see around.  The factual
errors seem to be mostly that she doesn&#x27;t understand what a 5-by-5 is.
   In our interview I was quite sure that I had explained it to her
properly.  She asked if people also solve the 5x5 blindfolded and I
said &quot;Yes, but nobody did in Pleasantville.&quot;  She asked if it was
harder and I explained that it is since, on the 5x5, you have a lot
more pieces to worry about since each side has 5 pieces instead of 3.
 I worded it better than that, though since I had already explained
the difference to her twice I wasn&#x27;t as clear as I could have been
that time.

The other errors are that Fridrich&#x27;s name is misspelled, but I don&#x27;t
see that as that big of a problem.  Dan is then misquoted about the
method.  Both of these, I believe, are related to the fact that the
reporter simply does not care.  During our interview she sounded quite
tired of the article, and she clearly did not put the full effort into
making sure to quote people correctly or record spellings properly.  I
don&#x27;t think that that is the fault of anyone but Wendy.  I don&#x27;t see
any other errors, though she definitely exaggerated what I said about
having heard of Dan before.

I agree that this is a terrible article, but I think the only major
error is the 5x5 business.  Since I clearly didn&#x27;t explain it well
enough to Wendy, Tyson, how would you explain to a non-cuber what a
5x5 cube is?

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I agree that this is a terrible article, but I think the only major<br>
&gt; error is the 5x5 business.  Since I clearly didn&#x27;t explain it well<br>

<br>
I don&#x27;t think you should fault yourself that much to be honest.  I<br>
mean if the interviewer does not care all that much about the<br>
competition, chances are that some of the facts will get messed up in<br>
the final product.<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like everyone was fairly clear about explaining the<br>
different aspects of cubing.  Perhaps she just wasn&#x27;t all that<br>
interested, and only wanted to write the article and go home.<br>
<br>
All in all, I think the tone and the presentation of cubing in the<br>
article is very positive.  I agree that many facts are wrong, but I<br>
think to some extent this is out of our control.<br>
<br>
Look on the bright side, at least interviewers are no longer asking<br>
tongue in cheek jokes about whether the cube helps you get girls, or<br>
how much free time you have on your hands.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Apart from the 5x5 thing, which really made me laugh out loud, I also 
think that one of the more serious errors was that the world #20 and

Other than that, the general message is perfectly okay IMHO. I&#x27;ve 
seen worse.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I was getting tired of trying to use my spacebar, or a stopwatch for timing myself, <br>
and I didn&#x27;t have any money to buy a stack-mat thing. So, I built myself a timer with stuff I had lying around. It&#x27;s just based around a stopwatch, a transistor, a resistor, and some nice quarter-inch brass plates, all mounted on a piece of black particle board I found in the trash. The plates were &quot;polished&quot; with my Dremel, using the sanding disks, giving them a nice shiny spiral pattern.<br>
<br>
The triggering on the plates is sensitive enough to pick up the loop of several people in a circuit, hand-in hand, but it does not false trigger.<br>
<br>
The only real difference I found between my timer, and a stack-mat timer, is that the start/stop is TAP activated, rather than release &gt; start, replace &gt; stop. But I don&#x27;t mind it. <br>

          <div class="email-content">well since everyone is weighing in, i will say that this article is crap.  ethical journalism requires a unwavering attention to fact and detail, regardless of personal interest in the story.  there were numerous factual errors, and general ignorance regarding details that could have easily been resolved with a couple google searches or a little bit of pride in one&#x27;s work.<br>
<br>
for example <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen, 18, ranked 13th in the world and second in North America for a &gt;&gt;single solve (1:54.32 minutes) and the 12th in the world for best average time &gt;&gt;(2:03.83)<br>
<br>
nothing is mentioned to transfer from 3x3 to 5x5 rankings/times, and with a 3x3 bld statment next line, it looks as though 3x3 is the topic the whole time<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That&#x27;s cube-speak for a Rubik&#x27;s Cube with dimensions that measure &gt;&gt;5-by-5-by-5 inches<br>
<br>
i actually did laugh out loud on that<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen says his fastest memorization time was 20 seconds for the 5-by-5.<br>
<br>
wow chris hardwick would be quite jealous of that :)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Friedrich method<br>
jesus.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;which is called orientation of the first layer, or OFL<br>
i&#x27;m in hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
now while mistakes are bound to happen, we should be able to expect that most of these shouldn&#x27;t happen since its just a matter of paying attention and research.  we&#x27;re not doing brain surgery, there are plenty of good references for cubers and non cubers alike.  this was factual slaughter and an extreme case of professional negligence.  <br>

I think I was the only one who was directly misquoted in the article.
Everything else can be attributed to just bad research or bad conclusions.

I&#x27;ll email the author and see if anything gets changed or if I&#x27;ll get
a reply, but knowing this newspaper, I do not think I will be getting
anything.

          <div class="email-content">One alg every two weeks? Have you even tried going faster? I&#x27;ll bet 
you can learn at least one a day, if you just spend a little time.

Just remember that it&#x27;s not your brain that&#x27;s supposed to learn the 
alg ... it&#x27;s your fingers. Do it over and over again until it&#x27;s down 
pat in your fingers. Every day, spend a little time redoing algs from 
past days, to make sure they&#x27;re still there.

Don&#x27;t be afraid to try to learn faster than you think you&#x27;re able to. 
Your brain can do some pretty cool things ;).

 I would either explain what a 5x5 square is (easy) or what a 5x5x5<br>
cube is by explaining there are different levels of cubes:  <br>
<br>
 2x2x2 has 2x2=4 pieces on every of its 6 sides for a total of 24<br>
pieces. It is also known as &quot;junior cube&quot;.<br>
 3x3x3 has 3x3=9 pieces on every of its 6 sides for a total of 54<br>
pieces. This is often called just &quot;the cube&quot; because it is the one<br>
everyone knows (and loves/hates).<br>
 4x4x4 has 4x4=16 pieces on every of its 6 sides for a total of 98<br>
pieces. This is also known as &quot;the Revenge&quot;.<br>
 5x5x5 has 5x5=25 pieces on every of its 6 sides for a total of 150<br>
pieces. This is also knows as &quot;the Professor&quot;.  <br>
<br>
 (and I know that names like &quot;the Revenge&quot; are not the official<br>
names, but the question was how I would explain it).  <br>
<br>
 I would also mention the time-frame that is needed by a top-cuber to<br>
solve these cubes on average (in nicely rounded numbers). 5 seconds,<br>
15 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 45.<br>
 (or maybe the best single times as 2.5 seconds, 10 seconds,<br>
45<br>
seconds, 90 seconds)<br>

shaped puzzles of a Rubik&#x27;s style. some people who like it may just be
frustrated with the original cube and boost their confidence by pressing
center buttons...

Hi all,

I finally uploaded my new website specialized in the Fridrich method.
It contains tips for F2L like Multislotting, ZBF2L &amp; F2LL. It also
contains all my algorithm for OLL and PLL, One-Handed or Two-Handed.

Have fun and enjoy it.

          <div class="email-content">Well in fact that is just algs I use because I found them pretty
logicals, so its just a mini ZBF2L which combined with F2LL can allows
me to almost always me to have easy OLL and really often OLL Skips. I
will upload it regularly because all things I want to put
on are not finished yet.

Have fun

Je me suis souvent demandé pourquoi, avec toutes tes idées, tu n&#x27;avais
pas ton propre site. Je l&#x27;aime beaucoup. J&#x27;ai mis un lien sur le mien.

Je ne savais pas que toi et Thibaut utilisaient F2LL! Ça me donne
finalement quelque chose de nouveau à apprendre (...et multislotting).

Dans le troisième algorithme de la liste, tu as oublié une apostrophe:
( U2 L U&#x27; R U L&#x27; U R&#x27; ).

          <div class="email-content">The VISTA bug is fixed now. There should be no problem to close Cube 
Explorer in version 4.20. The problem was not my code but the 
help system which seems to have changed in VISTA. I still run XP 
because VISTA seems quite slow to me, I installed VISTA in a vmware 
virtual machine for the only purpose to find this bug.
Another strange &quot;feature&quot; (is this really necessary?) and not a bug 
in VISTA is that the main window of the chm helpfile does not open on 
default when you have downloaded my program and installed it in any 
directory. VISTA gives a not very helpful error message. You 
explicitly have to allow to open the file in the property dialog of 
the chm file.
An operating system which annoys the user with permanent security 
issues because else it seems to run insecure has some design flaw 
from my point of view. Something like this is unimaginable in LINUX.
Be that as it may, get happy with your VISTA and the new version of 
CE.

Ron van Bruchem proposed to build in a scrambler according to the WCA 
competition regulation. You find it under the Edit menu.

          <div class="email-content">Salut macky,

En fait pour etre honnete je n&#x27;avais pas assez de motivation pour le
faire, je pensais qu&#x27;avec le bouche à oreille ceux qui voulais des
conseils m&#x27;auraient demandé, mais il semblais que je restais un
&quot;inconnu&quot;:D. Apres avoir parlé à certains cubeurs à Budapest et sur
internet (Dan dzoan, Gungz, Harris chan and the french team(edouard,
jean and thibaut)), j&#x27;ai enfin décidé de partager toutes les
connaissances que j&#x27;avais acquises avec la methode fridrich, et il
semble que le nombre de personnes que ca interresse soit plus grand
que ce que j&#x27;imaginais.

Merci d&#x27;avoir mis un lien de ma page sur la tienne, je mettrai ton
lien sur la mienne bientot. Pour le F2LL, je ne l&#x27;utilise pas depuis
longtemps avec thibaut, mais cela donne des OLL skips assez faciles et
des algorithmes en RUL assez faciles(surtout pour le cubing One-Handed).

Tu oublies le R-OLL!!:D Je pense qu&#x27;on peux gagner beaucoup de temps
en anticipant le type de PLL. Il faudrait que d&#x27;autres l&#x27;utilisent
pour donner leur avis car pour l&#x27;instant, je crois etre le seul a
l&#x27;utiliser(Edouard fais la methode R-OLL simple pour l&#x27;instant).

Merci pour la correction, je l&#x27;ai corrigé immediatement.

Have fun, sebastien

Also, I have my time down to about 0:55-1:36 on average now, but I<br>
would like to know if they was a faster way I could start to learn? I<br>
usually build a white cross on top, put my corners into place, use an<br>
algorithum to get my edges in the second layer correct, then make my<br>
yellow cross on the bottom, fix the 3rd layer edges, then orient<br>
corners, then make them face the right way. I notice that about 30<br>
seconds of my time is generally spent building the first layer. Any<br>
suggestions would be grand.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The way I learned was I wasted my time memorizing algorithms for F2L. Later, I realized on my own that it was based on intuition. So then, I studied the F2L cases and tried to solve them based on intuition. The &quot;pair and insert&quot; technique, I found out on my own and other techniques i.e. multislotting, utilizing empty slots on my own and later read about it on Dan Harris&#x27; website and other speedcubing website (hey, thats a run-on sentence). In other words, its not that hard to figure out F2L based on intuition. It&#x27;s actually better than memorizing algorithms. So learn from my mistake: do not memorize algorithms. Try to figure out F2L on your own.

          <div class="email-content">Hi there! I have just started cubing just about 2 - 3 weeks ago. I<br>
first learned using the beginners method... then I learned the Petrus<br>
method. Right now I average about 1:05 using the Petrus method. I also<br>
learned how to do the F2L using the Fridrich method. Using the<br>
Fridrich method, I average 1:30. I&#x27;ve heard some people say that it&#x27;s<br>
much easier to speedcube using the Fridrich method than the Petrus<br>
method, but for me I&#x27;m better at the Petrus method. Should I change<br>
and practice more often on the Fridrich method?<br>
<br>
PS As a sort of side question... One of the reasons I don&#x27;t like the<br>
Fridrich method is because you have to orient the edges after you do<br>
the F2L wherein the Petrus method you don&#x27;t. Is there any way to<br>
orient the edges while I place the corners?<br>

yes just learn the ZBf2L
a good website to go to is Lars Vanderbegh its at
cubezone.be

an awesome website for zbf2l

also try cubewhiz.com

No, I think you shouldn&#x27;t switch just because some people like
Fridrich. It&#x27;s about personal preference, some find Petrus easier/more
fun.

It is possible to orient edges before LL, for example you could
do it before/while solving the cross. But the Petrus way is more
natural. Fixing bad edges is an important part of the method, not an
add-on.

          <div class="email-content">Being Dan Cohen,  I think that I was most directly misquoted.  Maybe Tim&#x27;s 5x5 in 20s 
comment could be the worst, but I was the entire first half of the article.  I&#x27;ll go through 
each quote and pick apart what she did wrong.

&quot;&#x27;&#x27;It&#x27;s really all about the visual,&#x27;&#x27; Dan Cohen says&quot;
This was, I think, in response to a question about how you get so fast.  I responded saying 
something to the effect that lookahead was important and being fast required good visual 
skills.

&quot;&#x27;I know the algorithms. I memorize a sequence of pieces and then solve pretty much one 
piece at a time,&#x27;&#x27; Dan says. He&#x27;s memorized 180 sequences so far.&quot;
I told her that I&#x27;ve memorized 180 sequences for every cube that I can solve.  I did say that 
I know a couple of algorithms for BLD.  

The OFL comment, was just her not hearing me on the phone.  I definitely didn&#x27;t say that 
OFL came after F2L...
The spelling of Fridrich&#x27;s name was also a problem of the phone connection.

All in all, the article isn&#x27;t as bad as I think that most of you are making it out to be.  I think 
that the article, while providing some innacurate facts, did put a good light on 
speedcubing for the layperson.  I do think I asked her if I could proofread it and I just 
never got an answer to that.  If I didn&#x27;t, I should&#x27;ve, that&#x27;s my mistake.

I think we were joking a little with you =)

ZBF2L are like 400 cases, my XCLL i over 300, no way you will learn 
that, wery few of the most advanced cubers even try to do it, of them 
who tries few fullfill the learning process.

But, there is a substitute for ZBF2L = VHF2L, it&#x27;s ZBF2L in two step 
you can say and has got &quot;only&quot; 32 cases.

The algs for VHF2L are the same as the algs for ZBF2L where the pair 
is built already. So you will find the VH algs at the ZB pages.

          <div class="email-content">Thank you Herbert. I can confirm the Vista-bug is indeed fixed.

Thanks for all the work you have put into this program. I really enjoy it 
and use it often.

I want to ask you for one feature one final time. If you still disagree with 
me I will not bother you about this anymore.
Could you make the webserver able to accept all parameters that are 
mentioned under &quot;options, two phase algorithm&quot; and add a way for it to 
return optimal solves (preferably also using &quot;huge optimal solver&quot;).
I know that you created the webserver with the idea that it is only useful 
for robots that need an &quot;almost&quot; optimal solution within a very limited 
timeframe. I would like to use it on a webpage that will be accesible by 
everyone so more people can enjoy your program without the need for Windows 
(and lots of memory). This is also useful for reducing a (45 move) Fewest 
Moves scramble to an optimal solution and for testing the &quot;20 moves maximum&quot; 
limit with another program I wrote that interfaces with the webserver.

I hope you reconsider and make the webserver more powerful,
Arnaud

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Cube Explorer 4.15 released


The VISTA bug is fixed now. There should be no problem to close Cube
Explorer in version 4.20. The problem was not my code but the
help system which seems to have changed in VISTA. I still run XP
because VISTA seems quite slow to me, I installed VISTA in a vmware
virtual machine for the only purpose to find this bug.
Another strange &quot;feature&quot; (is this really necessary?) and not a bug
in VISTA is that the main window of the chm helpfile does not open on
default when you have downloaded my program and installed it in any
directory. VISTA gives a not very helpful error message. You
explicitly have to allow to open the file in the property dialog of
the chm file.
An operating system which annoys the user with permanent security
issues because else it seems to run insecure has some design flaw
from my point of view. Something like this is unimaginable in LINUX.
Be that as it may, get happy with your VISTA and the new version of
CE.

Ron van Bruchem proposed to build in a scrambler according to the WCA
competition regulation. You find it under the Edit menu.

          <div class="email-content">Herbert, do you use cutting of the tree or do does the program goes <br>
through all possible set of turns?<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I thought about a few nice ways to see if it&#x27;s possible to <br>
reach a solution whitin n turns.<br>
<br>
As for an example you can look for edges that are in the correct <br>
slice, wrongly oriented and not in correct position (FD at UB for <br>
example).<br>
<br>
A peice like that is not possible to solve in less than 3 turns and <br>
there are only four ways to that (I think).<br>
<br>
IF<br>
   non of those are the correct solution AND <br>
((current_number_of_turns + n) =&gt; max_number_of_turns)<br>
THEN<br>
   GOTO you_are_on_the_wrong_way<br>
ELSE<br>
  This_is_good<br>
END IF<br>
<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
If you take two edges in count there are not many solutions for those <br>
less than maybe 6-7 turns. Take a number of combos like that and set <br>
up tables for the solutions and it must be possible to save a lot of <br>
processing time.<br>
<br>
Is that a good idéa? (maybe you already know better ways than this? =)<br>

Okay. :D When I went to the site, I decided that the most important
ones would be where the pair was already formed.

Anyway, thanks again for the reply. :)

          <div class="email-content">Why on earth are people suggesting ZB/VH F2L for someone who&#x27;s been
cubing 3 weeks?  VHF2L is completely not necessary to cut down times
from 1:30 to under a minute.  Learning 32 algs (well, 16 before
reflections, but reflections aren&#x27;t always that intuitive for new
cubers) at his stage isn&#x27;t at all necessary or helpful.  It cuts down
move count by at most 3-4 moves on average.  Learning a 4-look LL,
which is less algs, would be far more beneficial.

Then saying ZBF2L...I know you were joking, but someone who&#x27;s been
cubing 3 weeks wouldn&#x27;t know.  If you told me right now I needed to
learn ZB to get faster, I would disagree with you and keep doing what
I&#x27;m doing.  If you told me that ZB was the only way to go four years
ago, I might have quit cubing.  ZB is ridiculous, you really have to
want it and be a really good cuber to be able to learn ZB and have it
be good for you.

Chip, pick the method that you like the best.  If you like how Petrus
F2L feels with blockbuilding and such, use Petrus.  If you like the
F2L pairs approach, use Fridrich-like methods.  At times of 1:30,
there&#x27;s no reason to move onto advanced Fridrich-style solutions like
VH or ZB.  As far as orienting edges goes, if it makes a huge
difference to you, use Petrus.  On average, in Fridrich it takes 6
moves to orient edges; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too much of a problem, but
if it matters to you, do Petrus.  But don&#x27;t go into an advanced method
before you know what you&#x27;re doing and are completely comfortable with
what you can do, and don&#x27;t try VHF2L until you&#x27;re really sure it&#x27;s
what you should do.  Learn fingertricks also before worrying about
getting really good at a method.

You could start to collect all puzzels that are used in competition:

magic, master magic, pyraminx, megaminx, clock and square-1. The clock
can be kinda hard to come by, try eBay.

I like to solve cubes with icons and funky colour patterns like the
ultimate: http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1078

Enjoy collecting and cubing :-)

Okay, thanks for the input. I&#x27;m probably just going to stick with
Petrus for now anyway.

beneficial at this point than anything... I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t worry too much<br>
about many new algorithms (such as COLL for Petrus method) until it<br>
becomes apparent that sheer move count, or inefficient algs keep you<br>
from getting faster... With practice, just using fingertricks,<br>
training your recognition, and being able to look ahead while solving<br>
can very comfortably get you around 40 seconds on average with Petrus&#x27;<br>
beginner method, maybe even lower (it works out to around the same<br>
thing using Fridrich F2L too). The most important thing, though, is<br>
that you have fun while cubing.<br>

My approach is to use the same method for them all but add steps for 
lager cubes. There is a lot to learn and I have not published any 
method description but I use it myself.

All is based on intuition and CLL + ELL.

For 2x2x2: build first layer and then do CLL
For 3x3x3: build F2L and then do CLL + ELL **
For 4x4x4: build F3L and then do CLL + ELL1/ELL2/ELL3
For 5x5x5: build F4L and then do CLL + ELL1/ELL2/ELL3/ELL4

6x, 7x and lager will add more ELL steps but are the same otherwise.

I got a special and very effective intuitive way to do FnL for big 
cubes (85-90 turns for 4x) but it is pretty complexed and hard to 
describe in short terms, it looks a bit like Roux, building F2B at 
first using a style I call Free Slice First n Layers, also useful for 
3x3x3 = FS-F2L :)

All alg for 4x4x4 ELL1, ELL2 and ELL3 is in a thread I posted this 
summer in this mailing list, look at something like &quot;ELL for 4x4x4&quot; 
or whatever I named the tread =)

// Kenneth
** Here I myself use VH/ZB-F2L and COLL-EPLL/ZBLL but COLL is basicly 
the same as CLL and EPLL is a subgroup of ELL so it&#x27;s the same. 
Earlier I used CLL+ELL but did not like what happen to my LL-edges 
when they were all oriented and I did CLL... So I learned COLL, VH I 
already knew from my older method. I&#x27;m also developing a style where 
you do CLL+EOLL in one and end in EPLL, but there is a lot of work, 
maybe I start to use it later for speedsolving)

Oh wait... you mean... we could share our methods? Dang, why didn&#x27;t 
anybody think of that before? That is such a great idea! We could 
even make lots of websites describing them, that would be so awesome! 
And then everybody interested in them could just look at those rather 
than acting like a lazy retard asking to be spoon-fed.

Anyways, I&#x27;ve found that you can solve most of the cubes using the
same methods, just adding a few more steps in as you go along, do you
all do the same or use different methods for different sizes?
(conquered the 2x2, next stop, 5x5)

One trick I have done is write all your moves down on a piece of paper
(in order of course) and just keep going through them, after awhile,
switch to a small post it with just the few algorithums left that
trouble you, and then, you won&#x27;t need them most of the time, so keep
it in your pocket, finally, you won&#x27;t need it at all! I should tell
you though, I&#x27;m not familiar with that method so don&#x27;t take all of my
words to heart, I will take a look at them and get back to you.

Well maybe I should rephrase, I try to figure out every cube on my on
before I check out the net, when I said &quot;feel free to post your
methods&quot; All I simply meant was some people use Petrus while other use
Fredricks, I didn&#x27;t mean type out every single move you do, just the
method, for there is alot of ways to solve different cubes, and just
figured it would be a good chance to talk about them.

Hope you don&#x27;t mind Tim, but I&#x27;m ganna 
hop onto this thread as well, my last one on this topic did not go
very well. Anyways, I have been told to try using the F2L method, but
I am having a lot of trouble and it just doesn&#x27;t feel very natural,
any suggestions?

          <div class="email-content">Sure, those are nice collections of physical cubes. My own collection includes every possible cube, tetrahedron, and octahedron where the number of tiles per edge can be chosen arbitrarily. Of course it is software and it doesn&#x27;t have that nice tactile feel but it is only limited by processing power, memory and screen size which all seem to increase exponentially with time. [N.B. I have only worked on regular tetrahedra, octahedra, and hexahedra (cubes) but will probably add more general cases eventually).

&gt; Hope you don&#x27;t mind Tim, but I&#x27;m ganna <br>
&gt; hop onto this thread as well, my last one on this topic did not go<br>
&gt; very well. Anyways, I have been told to try using the F2L method, but<br>
&gt; I am having a lot of trouble and it just doesn&#x27;t feel very natural,<br>
&gt; any suggestions?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Why would I mind? :)<br>
<br>
The way I would recommend learning F2L is as follows: Take a page of<br>
algs such as http://cubewhiz.com/f2l.html and figure out how each one<br>
works (in the link I gave, only worry about the first one listed for<br>
each case).  Watch the pieces move, see how it&#x27;s broken into a setup<br>
phase and a solve phase for each algorithm.  Many people would tell<br>
you to figure out how to pair things yourself; I feel like figuring<br>
out what&#x27;s going on is as effective, and you end up with good<br>
algorithms you understand.<br>
<br>
An idea for learning F2L would be this: first figure out how all of<br>
them work.  Even once you understand them, the cases will be difficult<br>
to identify and remember at first.  So maybe for practicing<br>
recognizing at first, when you do F2L, look at a pair and think &quot;Oh,<br>
that&#x27;s the third one on the second page of my printout&quot; or &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s<br>
number 17 on my printout&quot; before looking at how to solve it (but make<br>
sure you understand how it works each time you do it).  I think this<br>
would help with recognizing.  You&#x27;re pairing the cases up with<br>
something (not the algorithm itself yet) so they&#x27;re not just<br>
meaningless cases.  But numbers are easier to learn than algorithms;<br>
you already know the numbers, you just have to associate them with<br>
cases, instead of learning a new alg and what it looks like at the<br>
same time.  Then as you do that, you&#x27;ll start to find that certain<br>
cases make a lot of sense and you can do them for memory.  The rest,<br>
look at them again to see how they work and in time you&#x27;ll get them.<br>
<br>
The better you understand the cases and can do them well, the more F2L<br>
will make sense to you and feel natural.<br>

Well thanks a ton Tim, I am actually sick today, but I&#x27;ll get started<br>

seriously, thank you bud.<br>

Here&#x27;s a new online Rubik&#x27;s Cube timer you guys might want to have a
look at:
www.rubiktime.com &lt;http://www.rubiktime.com>

The timer is clean, simple, looks good and works great! The
particularity of this timer is that it let you manage multiple times
lists and stores all your session&#x27;s statistics. Anyway, have a look and
leave your comments!

Ben.

I would like a &quot;0&quot; count down time. I like to inspect for roughly 15
seconds, spacebar, release, and pick up right away.
Also, I noticed when you delete a time, that time still stays on the
statistics. I would suggest modifying that so when you delete, it
deletes off your average and stuff as well.
Lastly, it would be nice to add a scrambler ;P. 
Other then those, it&#x27;s a very nice timer.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the comments and I totally agree.
I&#x27;ll be adding a 0 countdown time, it&#x27;s been requested by most people.
For the delete that removes the time from statistics, I&#x27;ll take a
different approach which is to ask the user if he wants to save the
time and if yes it will go in statistics and you can&#x27;t revert it. I&#x27;ll
add that fairly soon because I agree, if you recorded a 1 second solve
by mistake, you don&#x27;t want it to be in your stats...Unless you can
solve it in 1 sec ;)

Scrambler&#x27;s on the way too...

Ben.

Didn&#x27;t know you&#x27;re the author of that web page... Good job!

I like it and will bookmark it because I know it won&#x27;t be neglected

          <div class="email-content">One thing I like about this timer (unlike other timers I&#x27;ve seen) is 
that the timer stops when the space bar is pressed *down*. I have 
problems with it, though. The countdown timer doesn&#x27;t always start 
when I release the space bar. Perhaps there should be an indicator 
(like the green light on a Stackmat) when the timer is ready to be 
started. Also, it sometimes stops displaying the time I just got when 
I release the space bar after stopping the timer. I would suggest you 
require the space bar to be released and pressed again before the 
time for the solve time is cleared (and replaced by the countdown 
time indicator).

Ideally I would like some sort of system that allows you to set a 15-
second countdown timer (with optional audible warning when there is 5 
seconds remaining), but allows you to start the &quot;real&quot; timer before 
the countdown timer finishes. Perhaps you would be forced to press 
and release the space bar again to start the &quot;real&quot; timer. Else I 
would just use 0 (zero) countdown (if available) time as others have 
suggested.

There was a display layout problem with one of two browsers I used 
(IE6). Also, don&#x27;t use a colon between the seconds and fractions of a 
second. (For the USA, it should be a dot/period.)

Anyway, I don&#x27;t expect to really use it much, being it&#x27;s an *online* 
timer.

Just make sure you understand the method you are

Sub-15 is very doable. Switching to Fridrich is quite pointless if one
just wants to get fast.

Thanks everyone for the good suggestions, Ill try friedrich, see what
i can do. I never checked my time splits before so for those i have no
ideas

The graphics at the end of the time string leaves some garbage at the 
edge if the last number is a little narrower than the last one. And 
my window scrolls down when I hit the spacebar =)

I&#x27;m using Opera.

(yea, yea, I know, use Firefox!... but for some reason it does not 
function om my computer)

But on my comp (firefox 2.0, linux) the times are not updated as soon
as i press the spacebar to stop the timer. I can see the times only if
i switch to another puzzle and come back. This shouldn&#x27;t happen right?

You can really cut down your times for all of them!<br>
Every PLL should be done in less than 3 seconds (Sub-2 is the aim).<br>
Just practise and practise and your times should get down. For example, I have been cubing for 8 months, and I can do all PLLs in less than 2 seconds (except N&#x27;s).<br>

My best 3x3 average of 12 is 12.88 (RA) and a normal average for me is around 14-15 seconds.

That&#x27;s just because the space bar usually acts as a page down in most
browsers. It&#x27;s not really a problem since the page fits on one screen
(unless you have the browser resized really small), and the timer
still starts and stops properly anyway.

I used to program a lot of graphic applications earlier and when I 
had that problem I usally put a empty space where the text goes 
before the actuall text. In pixel graphics you simply put a large 
rectangle of the same colour as the background in the area to clear 
out the old pixels.

For older computer working with strings and using fonts of fixed 
character sizes you used to write a string of spaces. Nowdays, when 
the chars in the fonts has got diffrent withs for broad and narrow 
types that is not as easy to do =)

Hello,

is the program able to mask out some cubie ? E.g. to explore Roux cmll .
There must be a posibility to disable some compares of egdes or corners.
I try to develop a program in standart C, to do that. (i use a mac)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

It&#x27;s the first time i have heard of a &quot;1981 WC&quot;. I read up on 
anything i could find about the cube in the early 80&#x27;s and i never 
heard of this back then. I guess it was nothing but a Guiness WR 
attempt stunt, and not a widely accepted one as there were many 
other much faster competition times achieved back then. Just read 
what has been written by Jessica and Guus. The name Ronald Brinkmann 
rings a bell. I came across it many times, but not sure where and 
how.

One should not be too harsh when reading about the solving times 
achieved back then. For one, the cubes were mostly much worse than 
the ones we have now. Also i guess most were completely self taught 
on the cube, not having access to the vast array of methods and 
algorithms we have nowadays :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Every now and then clocks, magics and other rare-to-find-in-shops 
puzzles come up for sale at ebay. This should be the best place i 
guess. Quite cheap, but there will be additional shipping costs.

Best wishes,

In case you think the 38 seconds made me ask whether it was worthy to 
be called world championship - that wasn&#x27;t the reason. I just 
suspected that it wasn&#x27;t a &quot;world&quot; championship but only a local 
record attempt.

The journalist I mentioned a few days ago sent me her article to 
proofread it and it mentions the 1981 Munich thing as the first WC, 
that&#x27;s how I found out about it.

There&#x27;s a radio interview with the winner of that event here (it&#x27;s 
German):

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I think that journalist deserves a compliment. Not only was he/she<br>
smart enough to interview Stefan and agree with proofreading, but<br>
he/she also found a pretty big event (maybe not really WC-class, but<br>
still) that almost none of us knew about. After all the previous &quot;bad<br>
press&quot; posts, this is good hear.<br>

cubing) found something legit about cubing that we didn&#x27;t know.

  I think that journalist deserves a compliment. Not only was he/she<br>
  smart enough to interview Stefan and agree with proofreading, but<br>
  he/she also found a pretty big event (maybe not really WC-class, but<br>
  still) that almost none of us knew about. After all the previous &quot;bad<br>
  press&quot; posts, this is good hear.<br>

I think she got it from Wikipedia (she gave me that as first 
reference when I asked about it). And apparently we don&#x27;t get our 
cube information from Wikipedia.

Does any of you know the person who had the IP address 88.65.79.14 at 
13:21, 26 December 2006? Because then we could ask for evidence:

Gah! People without account shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to edit...

It was someone from arcor-ip.net, which looks like a German ISP.

Here&#x27;s a pretty good site for looking up IP related information:

<br>
Today is a Dutch national holiday (Sinterklaas). Today 8 years ago I <br>

Knights and Mat Wilder.<br>
<br>
I never thought our community would grow this big.<br>
And we will grow again in 2008.<br>
If you are in a new cubing country: organise yourselves and take the <br>

That&#x27;s amazing to think that this all started thanks to Sinterklaas! I
think he should be called the patron saint of speedcubing from now on ;)

Great game as well, Rubik&#x27;s Games. I got it in the same period as you.
Even to this day I think the Rubik&#x27;s Cube simulator in there is one of
the best ever made in terms of user friendliness. It just had a very
nice feel to it that I miss in all applets that are around these days.
And it had all 4 sizes as well (2x2x2-5x5x5). For me it was the first
go I ever had at solving the big cubes and it remained the only way
for doing so for many years after.

right epsisode even after re-watching so much. Nifty find. On a 
related note, today I read though all the Season 8 comics. Huge fan of 
Buffy here :).

There is also one episode of Angel with a Pyraminx.

            At Dutch National I could buy a clock for 1 Euro. It was very bad, but

after opening it, cleaning it and lubing it, it is pretty good.

Yes, that&#x27;s how far I went (using nslookup). But I guess Arcor would 
at best laugh at me when I ask them who it was.

The same person also edited the German Wikipedia page, though in two 
steps. First only mentioning the championship, then changing it to 
&quot;world&quot; championship.

That&#x27;s indeed a nice tool, thanks!

Just so not everybody has to repeat the counting:

2003 2
2004 12 (factor 6)
2005 24 (factor 2)
2006 33 (factor 1.375)
2007 53 (factor 1.61)

          <div class="email-content">Hello.
This is a rather good topic to discuss. I have a DIY cube from cube4you.com, and it always pops on me. That is why I cannot go fast. However, my other cubes do not pop, but I wish for my DIY to be in a state where I will not be afraid of it popping.  According to my empirical observations, a cube pops when it has a loose center mechanism. This is found most often in cubes where you are able to turn a corner in it at least 45 degrees, putting it into an &quot;impossible&quot; solved state. I found that tightening it often times does help it from not popping. However, more observation should be conducted to test my theory.

            Dear Cubers,

            I am curious about why it pops, sometime. I would be glad to hear from you about pop.

  In the recent worlds-2007,  I had a bad pop. 

  Normally, it happens to me in my loose 444 cube. But it happened to me in 333 for the first time. 

           When your mind think ahead and want to go faster but your hand (finger speed is less) is not going that fast, it pops. 

           Perhaps too tight cube may be cause for pop.

           I remember, Ron uncle telling me to have more control when solving, when we met in 2005. Now, I understand that means mind and fingering should go together.

If you write it down like that, it looks like speedcubing made it&#x27;s 
biggest leap in 2004.

If you write it down like this, it looks like speedcubing made it&#x27;s 
biggest leap this year.

2003 +02
2004 +10
2005 +12
2006 +9
2007 +20 

It is almost always true that the first year (or two) have the 
biggest growth (percentage-wise) in these types of scenarios. Going 
from a 1-man business (or household) to a 2-person is a big step, 
from 99 to 101 is bigger and smaller depending how you look at it.

I think we should spread the competitions more. If done correctly I 
could have gone to 1 competition every week :)

Older Rubik&#x27;s has got flat centres, those pops easier but allows you 
to cut coners earlier in triggers (this is also the reson for the 
pop, you cut to much). Newer cubes that has got arched centres only 
pops if the screews are to loose. Again, loose centres allows more 
cutting corners, that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t tighten the screews more than 
enough to keep the pieces in place most of the times.

I myself are wery presice in my turns and sedomly pops no matter the 
cube so I prefer the older type, much because I use a lot of slice 
turns (MES but mostly M) and these are much easier to do on a flat 
centre cube.

But still, the cube I use most for practising is a customized anny 
where I removed the original spider that has got rivets for one old 
80&#x27;s replica spider with screews (wery nice spider). That one I 
normally pop in say 1:100 solves. The treads of the screews are 
pretty steep so they comes out by themself after a while and when one 
of them has gone to a certian point it starts to pop in almost every 
solve... 

Because of just one centre!

Ba, I&#x27;m self touhgt and newer use a spell checker and English is not 
my native language, I think I&#x27;m doing good =)

Ok, the typos, when posting here there is no chance to edit (or did I 
miss something?), otherwise, when posting in for example 
speedsolving.com I almost always correct typos and if I spot it also 
miss spelt words. But it&#x27;s all the same when writing in Swedish :-)

Grammar, hehe, always the same thing, &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are&quot;. In Swedish we 
only use the latter (but spellt &quot;är&quot;) for both singular and plural, I 
know the rules for English but only when I think about it, just 
typing away I often do wrong (in both ways).

http://www.bigcubes.com/5x5x5/lastedges.html<br>

And re-learned all of the special extra algs for last two edge <br>

about 10 minutes since I knew them before.<br>
<br>
I thought it would be prudent to compute the probablities of the <br>
need for each alg, and thought that the site should be updated to <br>
include this, but in the meanwhile wanted to share my findings here.<br>
<br>
I prefer to call them by different names, but for the sake of <br>
clearity I&#x27;m going to follow the site&#x27;s naming scheme:<br>
<br>
[N] all correct (1/24)<br>
[N] double wing swap (1/24)<br>
[N] double wing swap with flipped orientation (1/24)*<br>
[N] simple match/flip (1/3)<br>
[N] double edge flip (1/24)<br>
[P] single edge flip (1/12)<br>
[P] double parity (1/12)*<br>
[P] edge flip/swap (1/6)<br>
[P] checkerboard (1/6)*<br>
<br>
[N] for no parity, [P] for parity. I only needed to re-learn the <br>
three I starred, and now it is obvious what priority I should <br>
practice them and how much time I should be spending on each.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that this is the &#x27;natural&#x27; uniform <br>
probability, where as certain tactics of pairing may yield <br>
statistically skewed results... notably the &#x27;single edge flip&#x27; case <br>
may occur more often in &quot;greedy&quot; (triplets-first) stratagies.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Unless your cube is really causing you problems (i.e. jamming/popping
a lot) don&#x27;t be so quick to blame it on the cube. The most skilled
cubers can still get under 20 seconds with brand new unprepared cubes.

Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes are almost always better than the cheaper
knock-off versions. A lot of people like the DIY cubes where you can
adjust the spring tension to your liking. You can get DIY cubes at
9spuzzles.com or cube4you.com.

In any case, keep in mind that it is highly unlikely that a new cube
will be solely responsible for dropping your time from the 30s to sub-20.

          <div class="email-content">What a coincidence! After many years I just got interested again in
cubes, when I found out about the upcoming Olympic Cubes (very
impressive...), and thus I started googling around, and by chance
found this discussion! I can tell about this event from first hand
experience, since I am one of those few attendees in Munich 1981.
Unfortunately I remember only vaguely after more than 25 years... Back
in the early 80&#x27;s I was a student in Munich, and somehow learned very
early how to solve the cube. I invented some algorithms and got told
others from friends, and practiced a lot, so my times were around 1
min. It was a rare art then. I remember one Saturday when I did a cube
in the local super store, and the manager saw me, caught me right away
and offered me 20 DM for an hour or two of demonstrations and selling
cubes. Easy money :-)

Somehow I was in contact with Rainer Seitz (I think I wrote a letter -
no emails at that time :-)) and got an invitation for that speed
cubing event in the Munich Olympia Center. In my recollection it
wasn&#x27;t a World Championship (but I may be wrong, or I may mix up two
different events?). The competition which I remember was a local
Munich city championship, or something Bavarian or so. We were a dozen
or so competitors, some 50 spectators, some reporters and a TV guy
(which I remember clearly, because he lay down on the floor and filmed
me from there upwards in a very unusual angle, but I think it did not
make it into the news).

Rainer Seitz had a suitcase, which he handled very secretly, and which
contained some prepared cubes, all set up identically. In fact, I
think those were spare cubes, and he always re-did the solved cube
from the previous attempt and set it up the same way again (of course,
he let nobody watch him), and then the next attendee could try.

I am still proud of my result: I finished third, in 45 seconds. I
guess I was somewhat lucky, since that was better than my average time
of 55-60 sec. I remember the winner&#x27;s time indeed being 38 sec, so
most likely I was at the same competition which was mentioned here. I
always told friends later that I scored third at the Munich
speedcubing city championship. And, of course, at that day nobody was
interested in anybody besides the winner.
So I took my prize for the third place and went home.

I think I remember (not sure, though) that at that time I knew the
very best solving times to be around 29-30 sec., so I wasn&#x27;t too
impressed with our 38-45 sec results (and many others well over 1 min)
and never had the idea that we did more than a local Munich event.

Cornelius

Heck DanK should also be around that area... I&#x27;m counting, at least

I live about 30 minutes outside the heart of San Diego. I&#x27;d love to go
to another one if it were close enough, but really don&#x27;t want to drive
far. I guess the answer is to just keep watching the WCA site.

Thanks for the help!

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
For fun recently I&#x27;ve been looking at numbers of the form 10^n+1 <br>
where n is a nonnegative integer.  For n=0, n=1, and n=2 we have <br>
prime numbers and I was curious if this occurs for any other values <br>
of n.<br>
<br>
I proved that if n &gt; 2 and has a factor, k, that is an odd number <br>
then 10^n+1 is divisible by 10^(n/k)+1<br>
<br>
What I am curious about is if n is a power of 2.  Then we have 10^<br>
(2^m)+1 where m is a nonnegative integer.  I&#x27;ve looked at this and I <br>
don&#x27;t know of a way to factor this kind of term, if there is even a <br>
way to factor it.  I used this site, <br>
http://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM, to find that 10^(2^m)+1 is <br>
composite up to m=13.  I can&#x27;t test any higher than 13 because the <br>
program won&#x27;t allow numbers over 10000 digits.<br>
<br>
I search google for numbers of the form 10^n+1 but could not find <br>
anything that helped answer my questions about n being a power of 2.<br>
<br>
I also searched here (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/Prime-<br>
RelatedNumbers.html) to see if I could find if numbers of the form <br>
10^n+1 had a name and if they were potential primes for certain n <br>
but I could not find numbers of this form.<br>
<br>
I feel like I am either missing something trivial, or maybe these <br>
numbers are potential primes and I need to know more theory to see <br>
why or how.  If anyone here has looked at this type of large number, <br>
could you offer a hint of how I can continue to see if there is a <br>
way to factor 10^(2^m)+1 for m a nonnegative integer if this is even <br>
possible?  I am curious if large numbers of this form are potential <br>
primes.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Chris<br>

I mis-typed this, I meant to say that if n &gt; 2 and has a factor, k, <br>
such that k &gt; 1 and is odd then 10^n+1 is divisible by 10^(n/k)+1<br>
<br>
Though this trivially holds true if k is equal to 1 ;-)<br>

an oriented corner in the top right hand corner.<br>

Of course for case 3 you can omit the y cube turn, but I couldn&#x27;t <br>

          <div class="email-content">This later problem is quite computationally difficult if not 
impossible with today&#x27;s hardware. Attacking it algebraically or 
using number theory is probably not going to lead anywhere either. 
This is similar to Fermat Numbers 2^n+1 and then to the special case 
of Fermat numbers of the form 2^k+1, where k itself is a power of 2. 
There are only 5 such prime numbers known to exist: 3, 5, 17, 257, 
65537. It is not even clear if there are more - but there is no 
reason to assume there shouldn&#x27;t be, yet none can be found with 
today&#x27;s hardware, and unlikely in the near future.

Now to address your form or 10^k+1. This would be best observed as 
(2^k)(5^k)+1, for k a power of 2. Note that these can not be treated 
as a variation of Proth Primes. Proth primes have a certain trick to 
them that allows for quick computation. But here the (5^k) > k in 
the exponent of 2. Although it is not clear to me if you can still 
say that numbers of your form, 10^k+1, are prime if and only if: 
there exists b such that b^((10^k)/2) = 1 (mod N).

Oh also, might be relavent to Piermont Primes, which are more like 
6^k+1, but it might help.

It&#x27;s usually one of the first places people go to check if their

isn&#x27;t worth spending too much time on.

<br>
<br>
I am wondering if someone could suggest a good fast 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 speed <br>
method. I ceuuently take about 6 minutes for thes 4x4x4 and over 10 minutes <br>
for the 5x5x5. Any help would be great.<br>
<br>

Well, of course. In order for China to have the same ratio as even the
US, there would have to be over 3000 cubers from China participating
in official competitions. For a little perspective, only 2200 people
have ever competed officially in the 3x3 speedsolve event worldwide.

China is growing quickly, though. Just look at its status one year

          <div class="email-content">I had a similar experience.  I had ordered from CubeLube.com in the past and
received my product within days, so I was surprised when I didn&#x27;t receive my
recent order as quickly.  After two weeks I emailed them to find out if my
shipment had been lost in the mail - no response.  Since then I&#x27;ve sent two
additional emails - still no response.  I placed my order on October 31st -
it&#x27;s been seven weeks and I still haven&#x27;t received the product nor have I
received a response to my emails.

Since I really like a liquid lube and don&#x27;t want to use an aerosol, I have
been experimenting with other products to use as a replacement.  The main
ingredient in Cube Lube is *Polydimethylsiloxanes* (silicon oil - CAS
#63148-62-9).  This ingredient is also used in many car waxes, floor waxes,
and furniture polishes.  However, I have yet to find a product that works as
well.

Cube Lube is available from www.rubiks.com, but only if purchased in small
quanitities (by the syringe) and only if purchased along with stickers.  I&#x27;m
not crazy about the Rubiks brand stickers (I much prefer cubesmith tiles),
and I&#x27;d like to purchase in larger quantities.  So I&#x27;ve basically discounted
rubiks.com as a source.

It is also available from http://stores.ebay.com/PuzzleProz (an ebay store),
but only by the syringe ($2.00 each).  This is a much better deal than
rubiks.com, but considerably more expensive than buying in bulk from
CubeLube.com.  However, most importantly, they are reliable and they do ship
out the product you order.

If anyone on this forum has any better suggestions, I&#x27;d really appreciate
them.

          <div class="email-content">I have 3 timers (gen 1, 2 and 2.5), and a bunch of mats.

In general I would recommend just getting the $20 timer itself (it&#x27;s 
labled as simply &quot;Competition Timer&quot;) and has the &quot;data port&quot; for 
interfacign with the large displays, which is quite important I 
believe. I think they are the same price but this added flexiblity 
that we&#x27;ve come to take for granted means that your tiemr could then 
be used for competitions. (I&#x27;ve seen about 3 timers fail in 3 
different comptitions I&#x27;ve attended.)

The actual anser to your question depends on wheather you need a 
mat. I recommend aganst getting the small/mini mats. Note that, the 
new mats come in so many designs now. I got the colorful bubbles 
one, and never used it. These are quite thin compared to say gen 1 
and standard mouse pads. What I do is punch holes in regular black 
mouse pads and use that. It&#x27;s a ton cheaper and I prefer a black 
background as well as the smaller size, and thickness.

You ask about the &#x27;generations&#x27;... They only sell the newest one, 
the distinction with other gen-2 models is that it is a brighter 
blue, parts stay lit while off (acting as a clock), and there are 2 
additional buttons of up and down for such settings. It has a memory 
to store 3 times, not including the one that stays there between 
sessions (when there is a time displayed, it will still be there 
when you turn it off and back on later).

One thing to note, is that they sell both with data port and without 
(no idea why they&#x27;d even sell the later). The savings on the 
manufacturing-side doesn&#x27;t seem to add up to the diffed design from 
what I know of IOE... I&#x27;m sure the profit margin is negligable and 
not worth the confusion to consumers.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, if someone could e-mail me off list with some insight to
this I&#x27;d appreciate it, been bugging me all night.

I ran across this one on the internet today and have tried a few
strategies that do not work out:

Consider the set, S, of vertices of a regular n-gon.  Now consider a
subset, A, of k of these vertices.  What is the probability that A
will contain to adjacent verticies?

Obviously for k&lt;2, or k>n/2 the probability is 0.  I&#x27;m having a bit of
trouble hashing out what happens in between.  First I considered the
set of adjacent pairs and non adjacent pairs, but failed to realize
that the union of two non-adjacent pairs could contain an adjacent pair. 
Then I tried a counting argument for how many ways you could choose k
points such that no two are adjacent, but n=7 gave me problems there.
 There&#x27;s got to be something simple I&#x27;m missing.  It is trivial for a
given n, but I cannot seem to generalize a formula.

At any rate, it&#x27;s really bugging me and I know we are privlaged with
some brilliant mathematical minds.  As I said I don&#x27;t want to tie up
the list too much, so feel free to e-mail me over at spud(remove this

No, for the latter it&#x27;s 1.

What kind of problems? And maybe it becomes easier if you think of it 
this way: The first point is chosen somewhere, doesn&#x27;t matter where. 
>From here on you can treat the ring problem as a line problem 
instead, because the remaining k-1 points must be spread over a line 
of n-3 places.

That means it&#x27;s driven by three persons, and they have never 
participated in a WCA competition, correct?

The &quot;Why Join&quot; page claims &quot;there has been a lack of community&quot;. I 
disagree.

That probably cam off wrong... Their doesn&#x27;t seem to be a well
&quot;published&quot; community. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time trying to &quot;plugin&quot; to
a group and finally found this organization only by a friend that
directed me here. I think you guys would agree this is probably the
best community of Rubik&#x27;s lovers and we wanted to create a community.

As you can see, we&#x27;ve published a link to this site so others can join
here too. Please don&#x27;t take it the wrong way, this is a site built
around the rubiks cube.

Hahaha, that&#x27;s so freaking hilarious. Pardon me, but it&#x27;s now obvious 
you&#x27;re a total newb. The problem was not the &quot;our&quot;, the problem was 
that you spelled Rubik with a &quot;c&quot;. And now you&#x27;ve repeated that and 
even did it in your URL.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi RJ,

Let us start over.

You are very welcome to our community of puzzle fans.
You are very welcome to create a website. I look forward to more content on 
your site.

But please don&#x27;t try to create NEW communities.
We already have several good forums/communities:
- for official stuff: http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum
- for the more scientific view on puzzles: 
http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/
- the oldest online club, with various content: this Yahoo club
- for puzzle collecting/designing/building and some speedcubing: 
http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/
- the most active forum, for all kinds of questions: 
http://www.speedsolving.com/
There is no need for more of the same. And if you have something different, 
then first consider adding it to the current forums/communities.

Again, a new website with good content is always welcome.

Have fun,

Ron

Not asking you to drop anything... just support it. Be a member... we
want to be a top ranking engine for people searching for Rubik&#x27;s Cube
information... and when they find us, we want to show people that
there is a large network of people that love the cube... 

As for the products, maybe its a bad name... thats only to show
products that are recommended.

Anyways... I hope you&#x27;ll support the idea.

Why don&#x27;t we all just stop being jerks? I&#x27;m offically leaving this 
group because I&#x27;m sick of dumb stuff like this. Why be in a group if 
this is the way your going to act?

We&#x27;ve posted the links that people recommend and we have no problem
posting links to speedcubing.com... We&#x27;re not trying to replace anything. 

If you don&#x27;t support us, thats fine... but don&#x27;t coin us as trying to
take over another project. Thats not what we&#x27;re trying to do.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: Robot Solves Rubik&#x27;s Cube in 6 Seconds


I&#x27;d still need a video to convince me it&#x27;s true, but it looks 
legitamate enough. I&#x27;m throughly impressed. It doesn&#x27;t specify if it 
computes optimal solutions, but if it does, than doing so in &quot;1 
second&quot; is very scary. I&#x27;m thinking at least 10GB of pruning tables 
and a lot of RAM.

A few questions come to mind. How long did it take to develop? How 
much money did it cost to build that prototype? (Sure looks 
expensive...) Is the 6s with or without lube? How well does it fair 
against lock-ups? What device does it use for the color-recognition?

When I was working on something like this, we had to program in 
stratigies for it to automatically detect and auto-correct for lock-
ups by turning the other direction. This requires feedback control 
(and like a watchdog timer that kicks in if there&#x27;s no movement for x 
number of milliseconds). Also it is possible to have it do a bit of 
look-ahead and execute &#x27;triggers&#x27; dynamically. If it can do all 
this... it should be able to solve any cube in just under 3.00. Since 
it doesn&#x27;t there is still much room for improvement.

Well, Stefan doesn&#x27;t have kids.  But I&#x27;m guessing if he did, and when
his learns to ride a bike, he&#x27;s not going to go to the BMX community
and say they should go ahead and support his new BMX league.

Well, the site is yours, so the spelling errors do reflect on it.  As
for the community, why would your spelling errors reflect on that?  

And kemp_drumsalot, if you want to leave, go ahead.  You&#x27;ve been part
of this community for 3 1/2 weeks.   I just don&#x27;t understand why some
people think that just because we have a common interest, that people
should just jump at every request.   If you earn respect in the
community, then people will help you out.  When you&#x27;re new, you can&#x27;t
just have this bravado that everything you do is the absolute greatest
thing.

Like I said before, find some niche in the community and serve that. 
None of them are going to be as easy as just throwing up a forum and
getting to be &quot;The Moderator&quot;.  It&#x27;ll require work, but if you figure
out, then you&#x27;ll earn some respect.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, that was pretty funny.  It&#x27;s one of the high offenses in this
community: to spell the word as &#x27;Rubics&#x27; or &#x27;Rubix.&#x27;

figure out if this site is generating revenue in any way?  Or, what are the
ways this site generates revenue in addition to offering &quot;our recommended
rubics products.&quot;

It seems pretty simple, that the motivation for this site is by people who
know nothing about the Rubik&#x27;s Cube simply trying to capitalize on an
already booming market.  Actually, it reminds me of the Nigerian Prince scam
when you get e-mails with the word &quot;There&quot; misspelled as &quot;their&quot; and just
silly things like that.

On ualrsource.org / campusnailup.com his free college textbook 
exchange contains ads, so does his blog at rjmartino.com which btw 
exposed that he&#x27;s two of the three members and the other one is his 
sister.

And I just found this on his company website:

&quot;These costs are eliminated because currently iProv is paying for the 
site out of pocket. RJ Martino explained that the site plans to host 
advertising but is waiting for the number of &quot;hits&quot; (times people 
access the site) to rise. Advertisers consider the popularity of the 
site before buying advertising space. RJ Martino said he expects that 
ualrsource.org will break even sooner rather than later, so that they 
can potentially expand the site beyond UALR.&quot;

I know. But then why do call (in the subject of this thread) your 
website is the &quot;Largest Rubik&#x27;s Cube Group on the Internet&quot;? Why do 
you post questions into your forum and answer them yourself with 
another account, pretending in one to know nothing and then to know 
stuff in the other? Why do you claim to have written the articles 
that you copied from others? Don&#x27;t they teach about plagiarism in US 
colleges? And is it really true that you&#x27;re already flooded with 
questions (saw that earlier today, can&#x27;t find it anymore).

> We&#x27;re not trying to replace anything.

What do you have that speedcubing.com doesn&#x27;t?

          <div class="email-content">Wow... you are really treating this like it&#x27;s some type of scam! I
just threw a web site together that was going to try and keep links
manageable. For a long time I was using del.icio.us and then I
realized that some people were probably having a difficult time (like
I was) finding sites. I decided to register a domain and throw my
links on a site.

I know you guys are experts but it wasn&#x27;t easy finding the sites you
mentioned. 

We can stop this discussion when your ready... like I said... All I
was trying to do was help the game and the education of the game. 

If you&#x27;re wondering about the site, I am an open book... ask away...
no need to try and dig up stuff on a site.

The site was not created to mislead anyone... I just responded to this
in another post but I&#x27;ll go again... the goal of the site was to be a
central portal and knowledge base for cube lovers... We started it in
hopes to be the largest club... If you go to the site, you see its not
the largest site...

People aren&#x27;t automatically going to support it just because you ask
them to. I&#x27;m not sure I like your site&#x27;s goal. You should want to
create a community site because you have something to offer, not just
because you want to be the biggest on the block. Spelling Rubik&#x27;s as
Rubic&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t win you any credibility either.

We have Speedcubing.com, and we have this Yahoo Groups forum, among
others. What does your site offer that would make us want to support
it? If you are new to cubing, the proper thing to do is join already
established communities and get a feel for what they&#x27;re like, what the
people are like, what they want. THEN, if you want to make your own
site to address what you perceive as the community&#x27;s needs, feel free
to do so. Do you have any idea how disorganized we would be by now if
every newbie felt it was his duty to restructure the community?

Don&#x27;t just copy and paste information available from elsewhere and
expect us to all flock to your site. Not only do you have the text
from an outdated article copied from the Associated Press on the front
page, you have &quot;Written by Ryan James, 15 January 2006&quot; as if you
wrote the article. Plagiarism is bad, m&#x27;kay?

Well, speedcubing.com is a nice domain, it already has a very good 
links page, news, records, announcements, etc. It also does have a 
Google page rank of five, an Alexa rank of 97234, and is mentioned in 
many articles about cubing. It&#x27;s an excellent portal. What&#x27;s wrong 
with it?

Cheers!

Why should we register? What does your site have to offer? We&#x27;re not
going to register just because we want to be part of the largest
group. If that were the case, I&#x27;ll stick with this Yahoo Group forum,
thank you very much.

It&#x27;s still misleading, especially as it says &quot;Written by Ryan James&quot;
and the date the article was written. That could be easily be
misconstrued as you claiming to write it. At least you could reference
the author of the original article somewhere, and post the link at the
beginning rather than at the end. Better yet, just post the link to
the article with maybe an excerpt to introduce it, instead of copying
and pasting the entire text.

So now you see that a community already exists. Why waste your time
arguing with us? From this discussion you should be able to see that
what you thought was helpful is different from what we think is
helpful. Instead of wasting more time, why don&#x27;t you do something
about it? Hey look, I&#x27;ve just given you a suggestion. As have a lot of
other people. Why not try implementing it?

A word to the wise, people will be more likely to join a new site if
it&#x27;s started by someone who&#x27;s already well established within the
community, someone who most of us already know. We&#x27;re far less likely
if the site creator is so new he can&#x27;t even spell Rubik&#x27;s correctly.
Spend some time with us and get to know us first before trying to
assume a leadership position.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Daniel,

To summarize my arguments below, the probability you seek is, if I
haven&#x27;t made a mistake, 1 - [C(n-k,k) / C(n-1,k)]. Note that if k&lt;2,
then the probability evaluates to 1, and if k>n/2, then the
probability evaluates to 0, as desired.

Stefan brings up a good point, in that we should apply the tactic that
is normally involved in solving ring problems: convert it to a line.

Pick a random point and throw it out. We have now reduced the problem
to choosing k points from n-1 points. Note that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the solutions for this new (easier) linear
problem and the solutions to the ring problem.

We must choose k points from n-1 points such that at least 2 are
consecutive. Instead consider the complement: choosing the k points
such that no two are consecutive. Then simply subtract the probability
from 1 to get the desired value.

To choose k points from n-1 points such that no two are consecutive,
first imagine laying down the n-k-1 points in a line, with a space in
between each one where a point in our subset can go. There is thus a
space in between every pair of the n-k-1 points, as well as spaces on
either end of the marble chain. Thus there are n-k spaces into which
we can put k spaces. There are C(n-k,k) to distribute the k balls into
the n-k spaces (this follows from an elementary combinatorial
property), and thus there are C(n-k,k) solutions to the problem, and
there are C(n-k,k) ways to choose the k points such that no two are
consecutive. There are C(n-1,k) ways to choose k points in general
from n-1 points, so the probability of choosing k points such that no
two are consecutive is C(n-k,k) / C(n-1,k). The probability of
choosing k points such that at least two are consecutive is therefore
1 - [C(n-k,k) / C(n-1,k)].

          <div class="email-content">Looks like a beautiful solution to me.  And it matches up for the
values of n and k I&#x27;ve enumerated by hand.

The only quibble I have is that the formula breaks for k=n. Obviously
the probability at k=n is 1, but we get the indeterminate form 0/0.  I
assume this is because we threw out a random point to begin with, and
therefor define it not in any subset subset?

If anyone is curious about the source of the problem, it is this:

Thanks for the work and insight!  I&#x27;ll have to practice these.

seems like you&#x27;re a coup trying to usurp respected cubing sites. Build your
credibility *cough Rubic cough* and your 270 second solve time so that
people won&#x27;t think poorly of you.  Also, Stefan finds that you have a third
party paying for expenses in hopes that you can put on ads and make money.
Also, that you and your sister comprise over 50% of the club. So much for
&quot;largest club&quot;. i have one other thing to say. Your statements and policies
have more holes than swiss cheese. You can&#x27;t really expect all of us will
jump on this wagon because, &quot;Its the largest club!&quot; Your website is still in
infancy and while you first state that it is the &quot;largest club&quot; or something
like that and then you say there are 3 days since the website was live. I
don&#x27;t  get it. This may seem like a really stupid question, but are you
trying to scam people? Are you trying to jump the bandwagon and cash in on
it, a carpetbagger of the modern century?

          <div class="email-content">Chris, you bring up a good point that I never even thought of. I think
he may just be in it for the money. He obviously doesn&#x27;t have that
much experience with rubics cubes :P Coming to a forum like this
could, in theory, get a lot of people to come to his site and, in
theory, make him some extra cash. Guess his plan backfired.

You changed it now, but yesterday each article started clearly with 
&quot;Written by Ryan James&quot;. And the news list had a column &quot;author&quot; and 
said &quot;Ryan James&quot; for both articles. Don&#x27;t blame it on the CMS, *you* 
kept it this way and published the site.

Instead of making many small topics i make this one.<br>

The new website recently discussed mostly has old stuff in it. And <br>
the design is not compatible with internet explorer. The menu is in <br>
the wrong position entirely. I suggest to redesign the menu with <br>
proper javascript that is not using its own layer, but integrates <br>
with the page.<br>

Secondly, this yahoo group has lately been hard to access. I got <br>

          <div class="email-content">ah i hate it when i miss something like this because i&#x27;m too busy to check this everyday.  i would indeed assume the only motivation for the site is to make money.  he has nothing to offer, no new ideas, he just wants the traffic to generate revenue for him and his imaginary friend. 

 the current communities are very accessible and in my opinion there are actually too many as is.  as far as informational sites, as ron said there is always room for new informational sites, but i would encourage bringing something new to the table (which as a total and utter newb would be hard for you to achieve right now) instead of using other people&#x27;s work.

i think you are a nice enough guy that thought he had a good money making idea and went too far with it before researching and seeing that it wasn&#x27;t practical. i&#x27;m sure we would love to have you in the rubiks community if you square up and abondon these ideas of profiting off of our hobby.

I have my permit, but not my license.  That means I can only cube when
a licensed cuber scrambles my cube.  I really should schedule the test
with the DTP (department of twisty puzzles).

          <div class="email-content">Shatter?

So in my experience with these sorts of things, when a cube locks-up, 
the motors stop entirely (or vibrate back and forth violently 
depending on the type of motor)... either way it gets stuck in a loop 
and starts to *massively* draw current and heat up. If left like that 
for too long many motors will permenantly break.

I guess if the overall strucutre is weaker than the standing-torque of 
the motor then the plastic covering could crack. Though it looks so 
expensive, I&#x27;d hope they&#x27;ve considered that. A good test for these 
things would be to place a solid cube in there and see what happens :).

Another thing that is possible though unlikely, is for the motors to 
be turning so fast that the plastic melts (happend to me a few times), 
and the cube locks up chemically... in which case you&#x27;d have to pry 
pieces apart and sand them back.

Hem... I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun with motor controlled cubes in my day :).

          <div class="email-content">I think we can all cut down on the sarcasm/hate/etc when a newb starts
off with the wrong impression. He did clean up his &#x27;mistakes&#x27; on the
site as far as I can see now.

There have been numerous discussions about setting up new forums
mostly due to the fact that the Yahoo forum lacks certain feautures
(reply by email doesn&#x27;t work for me e.g. (- anyone know why?), and no
accessible threads).

Still e.g. Ryan Heise made a good effort to take away the pain while
leaving the forum intact. 

There&#x27;s nothing against a Rubik&#x27;s cube site, and if it has a forum on
it, why not. Maybe it&#x27;s best to call it &#x27;RJ MARTINO&#x27;S CUBE CLUB&#x27; so at
least we know it&#x27;s not supposed to replace anything with a similar
target group.

Maybe a good idea for RJ to develop is to support local groups in his
website. Every local group can then have their own tiny little forum
section, videos and pictures of meetings, etc. Although I usually like
to trust bigger names in the market like google groups, msn groups
etc. Another interesting one is http://rubikscube.meetup.com/

Just some rambling by me.

          <div class="email-content">I always teach edge orient first, then corner orient. Edge orientation
is easier to recognize at a glance, and you can use F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; / F
U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; which are short and easy to do.

In fact, a lot of people who do a 3 look last layer orient edges
first. So give it a try and see if it works for you.

Does anyone think that it would be a good idea to orient edges before orienting corners? I&#x27;ve always done it the other way around, but I realize that recognizing corner orientation is always more difficult than recognizing edge orientation. 

I feel like I sometimes waste time (not much, but some) figuring out which corner orientation to do, and that if I did it the other way around, I could use the time in which I&#x27;m orienting the edges to make sure I know what I&#x27;m doing next. 

Does anyone think this is worth it? I currently average 31-33. 

Just a thought...

Anything is possible of the steps for 3LLL. I can do orient the 
corners, permute the edges, and simultaneously orient the edges while 
permuting the corners. (But I&#x27;d be damned if that was faster :P)

maybe that will help to stop all those who claim &quot;reversed, played backwards&quot; and so...

or maybe not, maybe they&#x27;re just too stupid to do a little search about the cube...

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, <br>
<br>
Just wanted to find out if anyone knows how much does shipping cost <br>
from rubiks.com and cube4you.com (i&#x27;m planning on buying a megaminx).<br>
<br>
Also if anyone knows, does cube4you or rubiks ship overseas like South <br>
Asia.<br>

            Have you considered speeding up solves as well? Or undoing a scramble?

you would have noticed that rubiks.com doesn&#x27;t sell the megaminx - it isn&#x27;t
a Rubik&#x27;s product.

You can spray lube into the button holes.
Then keep moving the buttons and wheels for a while.
After some time the whole puzzle will be smooth again.

Have fun,

You may also have a look at Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s disassembling pages

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Lots of rush ill-fated conclusions in this thread. 

First of all, the retooled Rubiks 5x5x5 are looser than the old ones, 
yes, and may not suit all styles of cubing. But is it bad? No not at 
all. It&#x27;s excellent!!

Secondly, only old Wahn cubes (Krell cubes) and mefferts varieties 
have adjustable screws for the middle centers. If you have any 
Rubiks/Studio version you are in bad luck. Non-adjustable rivets 
inside ... Grrrr ...

My 2+ cents!

Hello everybody. I just got a Rubik&#x27;s Clock off eBay, and it is quite<br>
fun. However, it is very very stiff. The yellow buttons are hard to<br>
push often times and need some &quot;jiggling&quot; to get the moving. Also, the<br>
dials, on occasion, are hard to turn. Should I just break it in or<br>
commence to disassemble and lube it? I hope for the former, because I<br>

            Hi Brian,



You can spray lube into the button holes.

Then keep moving the buttons and wheels for a while.

After some time the whole puzzle will be smooth again.



Have fun,



Ron

simple.  We see what&#x27;s available, and then make a decision based on:

1.  The location.  Los Angeles or San Francisco is better than Modesto or
Bakersfield.
2.  The venue quality.  Is it a classroom, or an auditorium with stage and

Obviously, I would prefer to hold it at Caltech.  It isn&#x27;t possible for
January.

If aceboy222 were really as retarded as Shelley made him out to be, then he&#x27;d perhaps deserve it... however, I&#x27;m pretty sure he was joking in the first place (hence the xD face he placed after his comment)

He didn&#x27;t mean to actually suggest that whether he could go to a location or not should be a factor in judging various locations. . . 

Anyways, despite being from Ohio, I hope to make it to the caltech tournament regardless of whether it is in Southern or Northern California :) I&#x27;m dying to go to a tournament (for the first time).

 always people who won&#x27;t be able to go no matter where we decide to
 hold it.
 
 Also, Caltech Winter has been held in Northern California since 2005.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah.. sorry for being snappish earlier, it&#x27;s just that in the past
we&#x27;ve had people complain about the locations of our tournaments. We
have to make do with what we can get, and I know it probably wasn&#x27;t
aceboy222&#x27;s intention, but when people make comments like that it kind
of gives the impression that they don&#x27;t appreciate the effort required
to set up something like this. You understand how that would make
someone a little defensive.

So... you&#x27;re saying we should mock the real retards and fondle those

          <div class="email-content">No. My point was that he was obviously joking in the first place, and was simply misinterpretted due to the downfalls of internet communication. Thus, as far as I can tell, he is neither a retard, nor did he act like one.
   
  Furthermore, my usage of the word &quot;retard&quot; was meant in a strictly general/pejorative sense; it was not meant literally. If your point is that it&#x27;s inappropriate to use that word pejoratively (a legitimate opinion), that would be a conversation for a different day, and a different forum.
   
  Let&#x27;s talk about cubing now.
   
  Cheers.

write a new cube program around Christmas time as a kind of gift back<br>

This year, it is &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube Chat&quot;:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/chat.html<br>
<br>
It is a chatroom with a live virtual cube that is shared by all online<br>
users. Any moves that you perform will be seen by all others in the<br>
chatroom. Some possible uses for this tool include teaching someone<br>
how to solve the cube over the Internet (e.g. letting them pass the<br>
cube to you when they get stuck and letting you show them how to do<br>
the next step), having in-depth cube discussions about algorithms or<br>
methods that involve shared experimentation on a cube, and also<br>
(although I haven&#x27;t given it much thought) possibly some new kinds of<br>
turn-based games might be possible through this kind of a program.<br>
<br>
So please enjoy my little Christmas gift for 2007 :-)<br>

If you have extra time, can I suggest a &quot;Tyson&quot; version of the chat?  If you
could make the chat open up a text only version (no colorful cube), and had
it look like a putty window (black background and white text), I could
totally have it on my computer at work :P

&gt;<br>
&gt;It is a chatroom with a live virtual cube that is shared by all online<br>
&gt;users. Any moves that you perform will be seen by all others in the<br>
&gt;chatroom. Some possible uses for this tool include teaching someone<br>
&gt;how to solve the cube over the Internet (e.g. letting them pass the<br>
&gt;cube to you when they get stuck and letting you show them how to do<br>
&gt;the next step), having in-depth cube discussions about algorithms or<br>
&gt;methods that involve shared experimentation on a cube, and also<br>
&gt;(although I haven&#x27;t given it much thought) possibly some new kinds of<br>
&gt;turn-based games might be possible through this kind of a program.<br>

1) what method do you use?
2) how long have you been cubing?
3) what type of cube do you use?
3a) do you lubricate your cube?
3b) is your cube a DIY kit or bought from a store?
4) Do you do turns with your fingers instead of your wrists?
5) Can you execute an algorithm while at the same time planning what

&gt; Magic <br>
&gt; so we can actually start solving it in competition?<br>
<br>
I think if solving the Magic for time from unlinked to linked is<br>
considered pointless, then solving it from scrambled to an arbitrarily<br>
defined &quot;solved&quot; state is not much better.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve heard estimates from lots of Magicers that there are perhaps 300<br>
distinct shapes the 2x4 magic can take on that are not flat shapes. <br>
By distinct shapes that are not flat I am envisioning shapes that can<br>
support themselves when set on a table in some rotation, and will not<br>
collapse in on themselves, thus creating a new shape.  Call these self<br>
supporting, non-collapsing shapes &quot;low entropy&quot; shapes.  If there are<br>
indeed roughly 300 or so low entropy shapes then it is possible for a<br>
human to memorize the shortest route to transform each of these shapes<br>
into the flat 2x4 shape.  Then, you can memorize the shortest route to<br>
transform each of the flat shapes to linked, or to unlinked whichever<br>
we arbitrarily decide is the &quot;solved&quot; state.<br>
<br>
I predict, given enough time for people to fully learn this 2 step<br>
algorithm to solve Magic that I&#x27;ve proposed above, that we will see<br>
times roughly as fast as for 2x2x2 for solving the magic.<br>
<br>
Just because some people don&#x27;t like Magic as the event it currently is<br>
I don&#x27;t think means we should change the event.  I would consider<br>
either format, unlinked to linked solving or solving from scrambled,<br>
to be equally as &quot;pointless&quot; as some people currently see the current<br>
format.  I just see solving it from scrambled as taking more work on<br>
the competitor&#x27;s part to reach high levels than unlinked to linked<br>
solving, but both are equally as trivial in my eyes.<br>
<br>
I say if both formats are equally as trivial, let us stick to the one<br>
that is easiest to implement in an official WCA competition for both<br>
scramblers and judges, which would be the current format.  The other<br>
option is to abolish the event entirely.  I personally am very against<br>
the latter option.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, you are making a lot of assumptions and most of them really don&#x27;t make <br>
sense to me.<br>
<br>
First, you say that because solving Magic from linked to unlinked can be <br>
considered pointless so would solving it from scrambled to unscrambled be. <br>
Now please read that sentence again with this analogy: Magic = 3x3x3, linked <br>
= identity, unlinked = superflip. Everyone can be taught how to link/unlink <br>
Magic or superflip/unsuperflip 3x3x3 in a matter of minutes. But I have met <br>
people that couldn&#x27;t solve the Magic (or 3x3x3) if it became scrambled.<br>
<br>
Then you describe a process of learning 300 (many more than Square-1) <br>
distinct shapes and 32 (more than PLL) 2x4 patterns. To me, that sounds like <br>
an extremely advanced method comparable to ZBLL. This would in no way <br>
compare to the current way of solving Magic that doesn&#x27;t encourage exploring <br>
the puzzle at all.<br>
<br>
Finally you say: &quot;Just because some people don&#x27;t like Magic as the event it <br>
currently is I don&#x27;t think means we should change the event&quot;. I consider <br>
people not liking the way an event currently is THE reason to change an <br>
event.<br>
<br>
But for now, we are stuck with the current &quot;do T-perm as fast as possible&quot; <br>
event and I would miss it if it were ever cancelled.<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt; Why doesn&#x27;t Craig (or anyone) come up with a notation for scrambling<br>
&gt; Magic<br>
&gt; so we can actually start solving it in competition?<br>
<br>
I think if solving the Magic for time from unlinked to linked is<br>
considered pointless, then solving it from scrambled to an arbitrarily<br>
defined &quot;solved&quot; state is not much better.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve heard estimates from lots of Magicers that there are perhaps 300<br>
distinct shapes the 2x4 magic can take on that are not flat shapes.<br>
By distinct shapes that are not flat I am envisioning shapes that can<br>
support themselves when set on a table in some rotation, and will not<br>
collapse in on themselves, thus creating a new shape. Call these self<br>
supporting, non-collapsing shapes &quot;low entropy&quot; shapes. If there are<br>
indeed roughly 300 or so low entropy shapes then it is possible for a<br>
human to memorize the shortest route to transform each of these shapes<br>
into the flat 2x4 shape. Then, you can memorize the shortest route to<br>
transform each of the flat shapes to linked, or to unlinked whichever<br>
we arbitrarily decide is the &quot;solved&quot; state.<br>
<br>
I predict, given enough time for people to fully learn this 2 step<br>
algorithm to solve Magic that I&#x27;ve proposed above, that we will see<br>
times roughly as fast as for 2x2x2 for solving the magic.<br>
<br>
Just because some people don&#x27;t like Magic as the event it currently is<br>
I don&#x27;t think means we should change the event. I would consider<br>
either format, unlinked to linked solving or solving from scrambled,<br>
to be equally as &quot;pointless&quot; as some people currently see the current<br>
format. I just see solving it from scrambled as taking more work on<br>
the competitor&#x27;s part to reach high levels than unlinked to linked<br>
solving, but both are equally as trivial in my eyes.<br>
<br>
I say if both formats are equally as trivial, let us stick to the one<br>
that is easiest to implement in an official WCA competition for both<br>
scramblers and judges, which would be the current format. The other<br>
option is to abolish the event entirely. I personally am very against<br>
the latter option.<br>

A DIY cube really really helps decrease one&#x27;s times but based on my experience, it is possible to average much faster than 30 seconds with a store bought cube. Besides, I averaged 18 seconds with one of my store bought cubes and I have a friend who can do much faster than me with a store bought cube. What I am trying to say is that it is mostly about the cuber, not the cube. The cube does have a significant impact on how fast one is in speedsolving it but the way the cuber sovles it i.e. look-ahead and finger tricks, has more of an impact in the speedsolving of a cube.

          <div class="email-content">I also averaged 3 minutes after 2 weeks. I think that&#x27;s pretty normal.

The main way to get faster is to solve a lot. Progress is typically   
in spurts. So you&#x27;ll see no progress for weeks, and then suddenly one  
day wake up 2 seconds faster. No one knows why.

Don&#x27;t forget to try to figure out new things and trying to solve with  
as few moves as possible.

Memorizing sequences is fun and useful, but won&#x27;t really affect your  
times much until you&#x27;re under 40 seconds.

Getting a good cube right away is worth it, since it is now you&#x27;re  
forming your basic technique. DIYs are great, but a regular store  
bought cube with some silicon spray is really no worse until you&#x27;re  
much much faster.

If the majority doesn&#x27;t like it, maybe. As you can see in the WCA 
statistics, the magic in its current format is the fifth most popular 
event:
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/statistics.php#10

And I repeat the two key points against scrambling magic:

1) It&#x27;s subtitle is &quot;link the rings&quot; and what we&#x27;re doing in 
competition is exactly what the original task is.

2) Different states differ vastly in difficulty and time to solve. No 
meaningful records could be achieved with this.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

But Magic being the fifth most popular event doesn&#x27;t mean that people
actually &#x27;like it,&#x27; or see that it is an event that has merit and is worth
maintaining.  3x3x3 BLD cubing is a very well respected event, but it is
simply much more difficult to solve a 3x3x3 cube blindfolded than it is to
solve a Magic.  The ease in the solving of a Magic gets everyone to learn
how to do it minutes before the event and compete.

I&#x27;m not saying that Magic isn&#x27;t worthwhile, but I&#x27;m saying the difficulty of
the event to master and learn to competition grade skills is a major
contributing factor to the number of competitors.
