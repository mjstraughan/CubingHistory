          <div class="email-content">Hi Shelley :-)

I know a few people who would want to try to beat the new record. 
And that fairly soon. But i don&#x27;t wanna give anything away and get 
myself into trouble ;-)

Im sure all u guys feel a bit tired now, but considering Brent 
stopped 90 minutes before the end of time he has potential to 
improve :-) I guess his 12 hr record will stand for a while though. 
Mighty impressive :-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Congratz Brentmorganmaster ;-) :D

The Caltech Crew would appreciate it if people left this record
untouched for at least a few years. We&#x27;re not too eager to do all this
again.

I mostly solve with the cross on bottom, but in 25% of the cases I
solve it on top becaause I can perform it much faster, and I don&#x27;t
loose much time while orienting the cube because I get to see more
cubies while orienting it.

I wanted to ask the french guys to try to beat the record, but after
all, I&#x27;d better not say it too loud :-)

There&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to know from Brent (by the way, no need to
congratulate you on your record, it&#x27;s just incredible).

I&#x27;d like to know if such a marathon helps in improving some skills.
- Consistency.
- Dexterity.
- Etc.

Or, on the opposite, is it a way to develop bad habits, because when
you get tired, you have to rely on robust and easy recognition
techniques that may not be as effective?

You&#x27;ll tell us in a few weeks.

Gilles.

I agree that it&#x27;s inconsiderate for someone to break this record 
next week, but in a few years...? I mean, records are there to be 
broken. Cubers do it all the time.

No, that&#x27;s not true.  The attempt needs to be held under the 
jurisdiction of the WCA so if you&#x27;re in Europe, you might want to start 
being really really nice to Ron and Gilles, because you&#x27;re going to 
need to get them to donate 24 hours of their time.

I think for beginners, the Petrus method is a bit complicated... I 
have a beginners method available on my site, and frequently get e-
mails from ppl who say the explanation is quite good (not want to brag 
about it, but it&#x27;s true). You might want to try it: 
www.solvethecube.co.uk. E-mail me if you get stuck somewhere...

Good luck!

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">I agree. This is like saying that you worked for a couple of years for
the 3x3x3 speed world record, so please don&#x27;t anyone else try and beat
it for a few months/whatever. 

If people can solve more than 3141 in 24 hours, let them, they
shouldn&#x27;t be frowned upon because they put in more effort to do more
cubes.

I&#x27;m not saying you didn&#x27;t put any effort in, I think it&#x27;s a great
acheivment, I just don&#x27;t think people should be banned for a few years
from attempting it just because you already put in a lot of effort
into the old one.

I say banned because it&#x27;d be pretty hard to attempt to beat the record
if Tyson disagrees with it.

I&#x27;m sure Jess wouldn&#x27;t have minded someone beating his record a few
months later, it doesn&#x27;t detract anything from his acheivment.

Great effort brent &amp; caltech.

          <div class="email-content">Seriously, why are people claiming that I say all these things?  If you 
review the posts, you&#x27;ll see that I requested that someone should be 
very serious about breaking this record.  One way of proving to us that 
you&#x27;re actually serious is to break the record yourself unofficially at 
home.  I feel this is a reasonable request given the number of hours it 
requires a team of people to ratify the record.  In the United States, 
there are libel laws which prevent people from making up false 
statements about other people.  I never said this record was &quot;banned&quot; 
nor did I say the record would never be attempted again NOR did I say 
that we wanted to wait a few years.

And it&#x27;s not just a &quot;few hours&quot; of our time, it&#x27;s days.  An event like 
this disrupts our lives.  We take out large portions of our day, rotate 
off, and then we end up having to sleep.  It&#x27;s disruptive, we lose at 
least a day of not being able to do homework, and everyone feels 
miserable afterwards.  Furthermore, you make it sound like we don&#x27;t do 
any acts of selflessness for the cubing community.  It seems to be that 
you&#x27;ve forgotten that we actually run competitions and put a lot of 
effort into those ourselves.  See, I guess I forgot that I&#x27;m obligated 
to do those types of things.  They have it in my contract, because a 
cuber spends years cubing, then I have to take my time to fuel their 
obsession.

My friends and myself put a lot of effort into running competitions.  
We&#x27;ve donated well more than our share of time to the cubing community. 
  What&#x27;s a few hours to you?

          <div class="email-content">These are in no way final, but this is what the Caltech Cube Club will <br>
expect from you if you want to break the record.<br>
<br>
First of all, we don&#x27;t plan on running another event like this again <br>
until the summer.  We simply don&#x27;t have time, and I think I can safely <br>
say, unless you go to a tech school in India, we have more homework <br>
than you.  Our schedule is booked until the summer.  If you are <br>
interested in breaking this event, you&#x27;ll have to wait until June.  We <br>
are currently busy working on a competition for March 11, March 27, and <br>
April 22, as well as US Nationals.<br>
<br>
You must provide 10 cubes.  These cubes must all be approved by the <br>
WCA.  You might want to have more just in case some break.  Yeah, I <br>
personally don&#x27;t have 10 speed cubes.  Find some friends and borrow <br>
some.  We need 10 cubes because it assists in the counting.  Actually <br>
wait... you&#x27;re going to need to provide 12 cubes in case one breaks so <br>
we have 10 cubes in the cycle.  We had about 15 cubes available for <br>
Brent&#x27;s record.<br>
<br>
You will provide some staff.  Our club will provide two staff <br>
positions.  The cube scramble checker, and the counter.  You must find <br>
people that can read notation and scramble a cube relatively quickly, <br>
and furthermore, you&#x27;ve got to get them to agree to scramble for 24 <br>
hours, or you&#x27;re going to need two people to switch off, or three <br>
people, etc.  Basically, you provide the scramblers.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s about it.  If someone is interested in an attempt to break this <br>
record, contact me and we&#x27;ll work it out.  That&#x27;s how Brent and I <br>
coordinated.  We&#x27;ve been talking to each other back and forth for <br>
several months and we were able to work something out.  If you want to <br>
do this, shoot me an e-mail.<br>

That&#x27;s more like &quot;pi&quot; minute. Pi day is just March 14th (or maybe 1st May in the UK ... ).

          <div class="email-content">No, I was only being half serious. You would feel this way too the day
after a 24 hour cube marathon. Besides, Brent did set the bar pretty high.

If you want to try it, do so unofficially first. The record may look
easy until you&#x27;ve personally experienced the fatigue that sets in
after 12 hours of virtually nonstop cubing.

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I never said you said them. Someone else said the few
years thing and you assumed we were talking about you. This isn&#x27;t a
closed conversation. I never said we were banned. I was exagerating
because all of a sudden after brent set his record there was a big,
unprovoked &quot;DON&#x27;T TRY AND BEAT IT PLZ!!&quot; and since you&#x27;d be mad at it
being tryed again soon, there would effectivly be no point in doing it
if all you got was a bad reaction.

I never said anything about doing this myself, either now you&#x27;re
putting words in _my_ mouth.

Apparently we&#x27;re forgotten everything you&#x27;ve done for the community
because I disagreed with people not doing this for  a few years. You
appear to be making assumptions. Of course I havn&#x27;t and I
congratulated you last post because I said you took a great effort to
get it all done.

I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve done everything for us, but please don&#x27;t rant at me
because I disagree with someone having to wait a few years if they
wish to try this again. They should be allowed when they want.

Also, I wasn&#x27;t even talking to you initially, I think you kind of dove
into the conversation after the initial backlash.

Not even close to a geek then.

When I was running up to the last couple of weeks I had a counter running down to my 1 
billionth birth second. : )
I&#x27;d accounted for the leap seconds etc. but I was only able to nail the exact time down to 
+/- 60 seconds. [Time of birth is only recorded to the minute. :  (  ]
I took a lunch break so I could celebrate.

Also last time I was in NY I arranged to see a friend for my 1/3 century. (Although this was 
just 33 years + 4 months rather than exactly 100/3 years. I was in the UK at the erxact 
time, which was the previous day.)

And I&#x27;m not a geek, so not realizing that, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re not either. Unless you are in the 
original sideshow sense!

22nd July (22/7 in the UK) is close enough for me.

Yes, it does make a huge difference. I use to do F2L with cross on
U-face, but switched to D-face after getting sub-35. I got a sub-30
average within a week after making switching to cross on bottom. I
would recommend doing every step of the method with the first layer on
bottom. These are the two advantages of placing the cross on bottom:

Yes, that&#x27;s right. Must have lived in the US for too long. I was thinking of 1st May (&quot;31st&quot; of 
April) instead of 22nd July but it is true that 22nd July is used here.

What&#x27;s the best way to approach cube inspection to formulate the 
cross plan?  I can&#x27;t formulate that many steps ahead yet in my 
head.  Is it best to write it out at first and then execute to see 
if correct?  Thanks again.

I&#x27;d be surprised as well. I looked at the original post - maybe it was set in some more 
restricted context but was it really meant that CalTech has more homework than any other 
educational establishment in the world outside of tech schools in India? From the amount 
of cubing that seems to go on in CalTech I would be amazed if that statement was true.
I think the words &quot;I think I can safely say&quot; are very ill-advised unless of course he has 
experienced full-time education at almost all educational establishments.

Compared to the 1000&#x27;s of hours that speedcubers like us put into 
cubing, I think an event like this is taking just a few hours (for 
each person involved). You didn&#x27;t do this all by yourself did you?

No, Tyson.. How can I forget? You remind me of this all the time.

I don&#x27;t think the time we volunteered for this event is comparable to
the thousands of hours speedcubers put into speedcubing. Most of those
hours are people practicing on their own time for the sake of personal
improvement. We took several hours out of our daily lives and homework
schedules which we would much rather be spending doing something else,
and got little to no compensation in return.

Not at all -  I&#x27;m saying is that if CalTech really has more homework than any educational 
establishment on earth (except in India) then nobody would have time to do so much 
cubing. Are you confirming the statement about CalTech having more homework than all 
those other places?

Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty confident that our undergraduate core curriculum is 
one of the most intense academic workloads in the world.  It&#x27;s 
impossible to rank them numerically, but I&#x27;ll say we&#x27;re definitely in 
the top 1/2%.

In any case, it&#x27;s true.  The hours people spend cubing are for their 
own benefit.  The hours we spend running competitions and assisting in 
everything else gives us no such self-gratification.

          <div class="email-content">Why is this topic even changed?  The comment about &quot;tech schools in 
India&quot; was a small sarcastic remark in the middle of a set of 
guidelines we would request if someone wants to break the record.  Stop 
picking on this little small thing and look at the big picture.

We put in a lot of our time and energy so that other people can have 
the fame and glory.  I think it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for us to ask 
people to put in some effort themselves if they want this 24-hour 
record.  You will do it alone for 24 hours just so that you understand 
the excruciating pain that you will feel, and then you will provide 
some staff to help out.

I&#x27;m not responding anymore about our academic workload at Caltech.  
It&#x27;s not relevant at all.  I have made it clear that I am open to 
running another 24-hour marathon.  I do not see the necessity of 
continuing this discussion unless someone feels that guidelines that I 
have set forth are unfair.  This is not a forum to discuss Caltech&#x27;s 
homework load.  The reason for bringing that up was simply to say that 
we&#x27;re busy students, and if we are expected to take time out of our 
lives, you should be willing to help us out and make things easier for 
us.

And Joel, if you want to seriously attempt this record, I&#x27;d be willing 
to run the event if you would be willing to fly to the United States.  
Otherwise, you&#x27;re better off coordinating something with Ron.  It&#x27;s 
unfortunate that we&#x27;re all separated geographically.  I know Richard 
Patterson was talking about breaking the record.  If he wants to try 
it, I&#x27;m open to it.

Unless the guidelines I posted earlier are unreasonable, there&#x27;s no 
need to argue.

Personally, I&#x27;d love to see one of you guys try to break the record.  
It would be very entertaining for me, to see the human limits pushed as 
far as possible.  Also, the dialogue that results from sleep 
deprivation because very very funny.

<br>
I agree now, but that&#x27;s far different from saying<br>
<br>
&gt; I think I can safely say, unless you go to a tech school in India,<br>
&gt; we have more homework than you.<br>
<br>
Knowing that there are at least 25&#x27;000 universities in the world<br>
(8,407 of them being in India... I was very surprised actually but you<br>
can check at http://www.aneki.com/universities.html), you might say<br>
that Caltech is probably in the 125 *hardest* university. But knowing<br>
that the cubing community is a very specific portion of the overall<br>
studying population, I can imagine that you are making a huge mistake<br>
by saying &quot;we have more homework than you&quot;...<br>
<br>
&gt;From my personal experience, I can definitely say that<br>
homeworks/courses at CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) in computer<br>
science (CMU is ranked between 1st and 3rd rank for its undergrad CS<br>
dept.) do NOT take more time than attending classes at my home university.<br>
<br>
My point is that you shouldn&#x27;t make assumptions not based on any<br>
experienced situations.<br>

Again, I congratulate Brent and the Caltech cubing crew for making
this record possible.

          <div class="email-content">It takes a lot of practice (yes, pretty blank statement..). you can
try writing it out for starters, then move on to memorizing. a few hints:

1. know your cube&#x27;s color scheme
2. explore different ways/shortcuts
3. you should be able to do it without looking
4. position the pieces relative to each other then align them by doing
 D turns (provided that it gives an optimal solution to the cross);
this is related to knowing your color scheme
5. check out some websites that talk about the cross.. i remember
there were a few floating around here

good luck

This is an unreasonable request. There is ONE guy who is gonna solve 
cubes for 24 hrs or up to maximum 24 hrs. If someone feels he/she is 
up to it then why not go directly for official record? U Tyson would 
not be involved. So what does it matter to u ? If the person going for 
it has enough scramblers/helpers why should he have to do it twice 
(unofficially then officially). I can&#x27;t see that u Tyson can request 
this. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me ;-)

After all the cube is just a puzzle. And if the person fails badly to 
beat the current record, so what ??

          <div class="email-content">Cut a piece of paper square so that it is roughly the same size as 
the center (including the thickness of the walls).  Put it over the 
opening.  Then put the cap on, pressing the paper evenly on all four 
sides as you push the cap in.  The tension created by wedging the 
paper holds the cap in place quite nicely.  Be careful if you lube, 
not to get the paper wet.  Silicon-soaked paper doesn&#x27;t work as well!

          <div class="email-content">I would suggest &quot;feeling your way&quot; through a cross solve, if you 
have trouble seeing ahead.  You need to be able to anticipate at 
least 1 or 2 turns ahead.  Try for the first piece, then move on to 
the next, and so on.  Count the number of turns, and try to keep it 
8 or less.

With practice you will be able to anticipate and see the whole thing 
in advance, because you will have seen the patterns before.

          <div class="email-content">It doesn&#x27;t have to involve me, but it needs to involve someone from the 
WCA for the record to be official.  I personally am not a big fan of 
taking out hours out of my day if someone has no chance for the world 
record.  If they can find another WCA official to preside over for 
them, then fine, go for it.  If you want to do it at Caltech, we 
request that you practice once.  I believe people underestimate the 
power of fatigue.

We at the WCA need to design a system for dealing with records like 
these.  With all of the other records, there are competitions scheduled 
so you go to a competition and you do your thing.  For a record like 
this, it&#x27;s obviously done in a different manner.  Obviously, I can&#x27;t 
accommodate every single person who has an inkling of a desire to break 
this record.

One possibility is to have a one-hour competition and the winner of the 
one-hour competition gets a chance to break the 24-hour record.

Yeah, that&#x27;s basically the idea.  I mean... we have to have some type 
of standard right?  We don&#x27;t have enough time to give every single 
cube-solve out there a chance at this record.  We especially don&#x27;t have 
time to let people &quot;try it&quot; just for fun, if they don&#x27;t have a good 
shot at doing this.  A record attempt like this is not a trivial work 
of organization for us and is very disruptive to our lives.

I agree, world records are meant to be broken.  But nobody&#x27;s life 
revolves around cubing, and we need to respect everyone&#x27;s commitments 
to other aspects of their lives.

Point taken. You are solely talking about involving people at 
Caltech for an official attempt. Got it :D

So this was a dispute over nothing basically ...

But i would still claim regarding the fatigue that 1 hr cubing is 
not really related to 24 hr cubing. Someone doing worse than another 
guy for 1 hr cubing may have more stamina for the 24 hr cubing.

I don&#x27;t think that too many ppl are gonna attempt to break the 
record anyway. And most likely next attempt will be in europe ... ??

          <div class="email-content">ok, so like at the end... like theres that one
algorithm thing that messes up everything at the
end... like exept the top, just keep going, and like
at the end of it, it will work out really well.
otherwise look at jessica fridrich&#x27;s solution. or
jasmine&#x27;s. by tthe way, you have to hold the cube
exactly like it is in the solution book.. like yea...
ok.. w/e bye.

          <div class="email-content">For Christmas I got myself a 25th anniversary cube from FAO Shwartz<br>
(with regular colors including a white side), and I have never played<br>
with a cube that rotated as smoothly.<br>
<br>
Today I went to Walmart and bought a 25th anniverary edition with a<br>
silver side instead of white. This was to be my work practice cube. I<br>
excitedly ripped it out of the plastic casing only to try to turn it<br>
and it is so stiff!  I can barely turn each side.<br>
<br>
Being a newbie and only able to compare the two cubes, I am sorely<br>
disappointed with the new cube. Should I return it, or is it worth<br>
taking it apart, sanding the cubies a little and adding some silicon<br>
spray?<br>
<br>
For the price it wasn&#x27;t bad, $9.97, and the store is not far away. I<br>
think there were another 5 or 6 on the shelf... maybe I just got a bad<br>
one?  Or do they all need a little work to get them just right?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the advice.<br>

          <em>From:</em> Brent Morgan &lt;brentmorganmaster@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, caltechrubiks@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Mon, 20 Feb 2006 19:10:43 -0800 (PST)<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
       Firstly I&#x27;d like to thank all of the people who were interested in my attempt.  I laughed at Stefan&#x27;s pictures and some of the guesses were close.  I would also like to thank the Caltech members who participated in my attempt, and who worked _very_ hard to make this possible.  I would like to officially thank the following people: Mark Polinkovsky, Mark Sullivan, Daniel Lo, Shelley Chang, Leyan Lo, Michael White, Michael Inadomi, Eileen Xie, Christopher Kreuger, Matthew Wallisa, Adam Zamora, Tyson Mao, and Chris Hunt.  Chris, thanks for your timer- I think we ended up using a combination of Netcube and the Marathon timer...  Not sure :).  Thanks to my mom who took care of the transportation while I was half asleep.<br>
       People have asked what it&#x27;s like- the fatigue, the results, etc.  Let&#x27;s just say my wrist went out within the first 2 hours- so imagine at the 12 hour mark it hurt pretty badly.  I guess this can be fixed with a set of super loose cubes.  The pain goes away after a very long hour nap though :).  I think my arms are twice as strong now that it&#x27;s over....  I do think I could have done 2001 at 12 hours flat, if I didn&#x27;t take the 15 minutes of break within the first 12 hours.  It&#x27;s tough- nonstop cubing.  The hardest part is keeping the time down with no-preinspection.  A little more practice with no inspection would have helped.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s very good practice for 24 hours straight.  Honestly I do think 4000 is possible, with the motivation and training.<br>
       I agree with the Caltech members that it was tiring for them; some of them were doing homework and were up as long as me (some even more, some less).  I respect the fact that people like this exist in the Cubing community to make things like this happen.  I did enjoy this, because the Caltech people were pretty cool about it.  <br>
       I see a few people have become interested in this category now, and see it possible to beat.  That&#x27;s really awesome- go for it!  If anyone is up for a try at it, I do say that I&#x27;ll be willing to do this again; actually, I&#x27;m up for a dual match.  In other words, I&#x27;d do the next attempt racing head on (one vs. one) with anyone else who wants to do it.  Personally I wouldn&#x27;t ask Tyson and his crew to do this again- they&#x27;re all cool, and I respect their successful effort in helping me, but they probably have more important things to do :).  So if anyone wants to break 3141, I&#x27;m up for a head on one-to-one 24 hour marathon race with someone else setting it up.  If you&#x27;re interested, send me an email.  I&#x27;m game.<br>
       By the way, after the 2001st solve at 12 hours and 8 minutes, I took an hour break.  By the time I finished, I had about an hour left, so I did have some time left.  I do think 3141 is possible to beat, but...  If someone else is willing to break it, I&#x27;m willing to do a 24 hour marathon again to race with them.  Again, if you&#x27;re interested, email me.  I respect that Tyson and his crew are setting up Nationals later this year and that&#x27;s super duper cool enough for me.  <br>
       And thanks to all the people who personally emailed me about it- that&#x27;s pretty cool.  Thanks to Frank Morris for sending me a cube to practice on before nationals, and thanks to everyone else.  If I didn&#x27;t include your name and you were a part of this, I deeply apologize, and you can email me about it.<br>
       Besides, the scramblers seemed to have increased their speed as well ;) [namely Matt Wallisa].  Racing the scramblers was a motivation, too, to keep the pace.  It worked for many hours...<br>
       For the caltech people, I do ask one more thing: can you send me the data of my solves vs. time graph you had?  I would appreciate it.  Thanks a bunch.<br>
   <br>
  Again, if you&#x27;re interested in a 24 hour marathon attempt, maybe we can get all the people interested at one time and race head on, so email me.  I&#x27;m definately game.  I completely understand if Tyson&#x27;s crew can&#x27;t do it for a year or whatever- it&#x27;s all good with me, because they worked hard as well, and they shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;the&quot; people to do this every time.<br>
   <br>
  Peace everybody,<br>

Well i am from an &quot;indian tech school&quot; . The Indian Institute of
Technology , Bombay. Which i am proud to say was ranked third in
teching in the world.

I guess you made this requirement to stop people from having a go at
this record but now you cant stop me! :)

Anyways if this was meant as a scarcastic comment then i guess its
your ignorance.

And since now that i am now eligible, i can start practicing for the
record   :-)

          <div class="email-content">I dunno...might as well try considering how stiff some of those 25th 
ones are.  I mean, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re losing much, considering how 
bad they can be, and considering how easily replaceable (sp? sorry, 
it&#x27;s too late to try to spell) they are.

Oh, and get rid of the damn reflective stickers.  I had a friend who 
was solving one of those with a red shirt on...not cool.  Any 
reflective sticker on the F face looked red.  They&#x27;re so 
distracting.  And, even with a non-speedcuber using it, at least 
three stickers fell off (down to the white thing) within a week.  
Four days, more like.  Really, the stickers are poorly designed.  
Rubiks should get a truckload of cubesmith stickers.

Don&#x27;t you think that 24 hours is too much (competitor + organization)?<br>
Unless you need to ruin your health, I feel that a 1-hour cube marathon<br>
could be a good format.<br>
It would require fewer people / competitor, allowing more competitors to<br>
race at the same time.<br>
It could even be a side event in a competition, media would like it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This discussion is getting quite annoying, and i dont get the problems
here.
 
A few ppl has put a lot of effort into helping someone attempt a cube
record, and that is great. It was a great achievement, and everyone
applaud the record, and the helpers, right ?
 
The record was a lot of hard work, both for Brent and for all the ppl
helping. Can everyone agree on that one also ?
 
If any of you were to attempt to run a marathon, 42 K, they would
probably train a bit and attempt to run atleast 20 K as a preparation
for the marathon, right ?
 
So then why is it so hard to grasp the concept that in order to attempt
a 24 hours cube marathon, one try to cube for quite a few hours,
preferably 12 hours to see if they have the stamina. Of course if would
be nice to have a few scramblers, but as i see it, just solving and
scrambling the cubes yourself for 12 hours should give you a good idea
if you are able to do a genuine record attempt.
 
And I have always regarded the cube community as a lot of open minded
friendly ppl, so I just cant see why this discussion has escalated this
way.

Terje

Sadly, that&#x27;s undeniable: I found a headlouse in my hair only the other 
day.  (True.)

          <div class="email-content">I traced the center cap on notebook paper and cut that out.  The paper
square is slightly larger than the center cap, as tends to happen wh en you
trace something.

Then I cut the corners off the paper square to make an octagon.  This was
very quick and has worked well.  I think a thicker paper would have worked
better, as the caps do sometimes pop off if I drop the cube.  But they stay
on just great otherwise, and I can easily take them off with my fingernails
if I need to adjust the springs.

          <div class="email-content">I think the comparison between standard and cube marathon is not correct. If you run 20 or 42 km, you do it in daytime when you brain is fresh (if it is relevant). If you cube 12 h, your brain is (more or less) fresh (which Is relevent). But what will happen after 16-17 h? You will never get to know, if you so repeat your 12-hour training a 100 times. I think One method to get an answer could be the following: Live and act as usually during daytime. After 15-16 hours you get tired and will go to bed. Don´t! Start cubing and go on for some 8 hours. Now you´ll get an approximate answer on how you would react in the end of a cube marathon.

This discussion is getting quite annoying, and i dont get the problems
here.
 
A few ppl has put a lot of effort into helping someone attempt a cube
record, and that is great. It was a great achievement, and everyone
applaud the record, and the helpers, right ?
 
The record was a lot of hard work, both for Brent and for all the ppl
helping. Can everyone agree on that one also ?
 
If any of you were to attempt to run a marathon, 42 K, they would
probably train a bit and attempt to run atleast 20 K as a preparation
for the marathon, right ?
 
So then why is it so hard to grasp the concept that in order to attempt
a 24 hours cube marathon, one try to cube for quite a few hours,
preferably 12 hours to see if they have the stamina. Of course if would
be nice to have a few scramblers, but as i see it, just solving and
scrambling the cubes yourself for 12 hours should give you a good idea
if you are able to do a genuine record attempt.
 
And I have always regarded the cube community as a lot of open minded
friendly ppl, so I just cant see why this discussion has escalated this
way.

I have a field guide on insects which tells me that headlice are &quot;rare&quot; 
in the UK.  So much for the fieldguide -- the author should visit a 
British primary school!

My mother (now 75) was checked for them regularly (at school and at 
home), but says that she never knew anyone who had them.  Nowadays 
there is less awareness of the problem (no checking at school, AFAIK), 
even though most children get infested at some point: all 3 of mine 
have had them.

So: the headlouse is possibly extinct in Sweden, but thriving in the 
UK.  Does anyone know what the situation is elsewhere in Europe?

<br>
I just uploaded a nice tutorial about commutators to my website... In <br>
my view one of the best updates ever, especially because there are not <br>
somany websites that explain how to use commutators to solve puzzles. <br>
I think my tutorial is quite easy to read, especially for experienced <br>

Tyson suggested this format.
Proposing such a race in all competitions for many competitors is not
possible. Too many people would be required.
But in a big competition, if let&#x27;s say 3 top speed-cubers with about
the same skills want to race each others and break records, that would
be a nice show.

I&#x27;m talking about this because 1 hour rewards consistency, but with a
much narrower time frame, whereas 24 hours is more about stamina, and
that&#x27;s not what I prefer personally (I don&#x27;t read the Guiness book).

Another kind of race would be cool and easier to organize for a larger
number of competitors. 10 (or at least 5) identically scrambled cubes
per competitor. Standard timing, no-inspection protocol, with 1 cover
on the cubes before the timer starts.

Gilles.

PS: We would need a scrambling machine! An army of DeepCube(TM) robots!

Btw, I just started learning OLL and found that your OLL page is very
nice and actually enabled me to learn a lot faster the algorithms! I
would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a 2-look LL.

Nice job at keeping your site updated.

This post got progressively more weird as I read through it, but I 
can confirm that this means you can&#x27;t solve the cube blindfolded in 
general, but only a small subset of cases.
On the other hand, your post seems to indicate you may have a good 
chance of becoming the first lycanthrope to solve the cube 
blindfolded.
I could point you to some sites that would help you with the 
orientation, but you might be too cool for them.

Well, it does exist, though only for the already correctly permuted

But that guy is too cool for me and my method anyway.

You can see he had blue, orange and white on the back face here:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/brent_counter.JPG

So if he used standard BOY then I&#x27;d say cube orientation was not fixed 
at all.

Well.. For the correctly permuted pieces: you can also think of a 
twisted corner as a three-cycle of stickers... If you use the &#x27;pure&#x27; 
version of your method ;).

I&#x27;m sorry, but lycanthropes don&#x27;t purr or miaow: they /howl/ when the 
moon is full, which it isn&#x27;t right now.  

But this might instead be a friend or associate of the puzzling Mr 
Dennis Abner: http://tinyurl.com/9869a

I don&#x27;t know whether Mr Abner can solve BLD.

Hi Joel,

very nice, I like it a lot. But of course I have to write some 
suggestions/comments anyway :-)

- To show the commutator structure and the &quot;little overlapping&quot; rule I 
like to compare &quot;shoe off, sock off, shoe on, sock on&quot; with &quot;shoe off 
glove off, shoe on, glove on&quot;.

- On the cube the &quot;little overlapping&quot; becomes nicely visible if you 
take the T-perm as P, and for Q first use D, then L, then U. Shows how 
larger overlap results in larger effects.

- Example 1: (B L2 B&#x27; R B L2 B&#x27; R&#x27;) has the nice alternative solution 
(R&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; R U L U&#x27;).

- Can you give unique numbers to all examples to make referring to 
them easier?

- What&#x27;s (P = R&#x27;UL&#x27; and Q = U&#x27;) supposed to do?

- For the 4x4 applets, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to turn the algorithm 
display off, but I don&#x27;t remember how right now.

- (P = l r&#x27; u2 l&#x27; r&#x27;) should be (P = l r&#x27; u2 l&#x27; r)

- Why always only outer slice turns for Q, never inner slice turns? 
For example (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M&#x27; (U R U&#x27;) M. Also results in a nice alg with 
setup move R: (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; M&#x27; U R U&#x27; r&#x27;). Inner slice turns for Q is 
also very helpful for 4x4.

- Gosh did I have a sunburn.

Cheers!
Stefan

You can see he had blue, orange and white on the back face here:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/brent_counter.JPG

So if he used standard BOY then I&#x27;d say cube orientation was not fixed 
at all.

Hey Rune- No, the cube had to be random every single time, so each cube was a different color on top each time.

solving a rubik&#x27;s cube.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a finite state machine with a large number of states, a few number <br>
of possible moves, and one solved state. It has considerably fewer than <br>
a rubik&#x27;s cube though, only 3^16.<br>
<br>
Initally I used a depth first search, and I don&#x27;t know how long God&#x27;s <br>
algorithm for this will be, but from empirical tests, it&#x27;s more than I <br>
can solve efficiently.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been looking all over the internet to try to find a clear <br>
explaination of the algorithm used to solve the cube.  All I can find <br>
is that it is a heuristic algorithm, nothing more.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows how to implement this algorithm or can direct me to a <br>
page that can tell me, that would be great.<br>

&gt; I think my tutorial is quite easy to read, especially for experienced <br>

<br>
Regarding the 9 basic corner commutators and their conjugates, they are<br>
also described here, but with a different mental process:<br>

The goal was to develop a thought process (or a way of thinking) that<br>

although I haven&#x27;t really updated the page since first publishing it.<br>
<br>
The site as a whole describes a method for solving the cube<br>
&quot;move-by-move&quot;, i.e. without any fixed or memorised sequences, that also<br>
achieves a low move count and supports fast recognition. It&#x27;s a rather<br>
long term development, but I hope that it will pay off in the end.<br>

Personally i think only timed solving of 42 cubes, consecutively 
without inspection, should be called cubing marathon because the 
number 42 is involved. 42 cubes to be solved ;-)

Those other 2 categories should simply be called 1hr cubing and 24 
hr cubing, so as not to confuse these 3 very different categories of 
cubing.

Then there could also be 5 hr cubing, 12 hr cubing. So easy system :D

Just my 2 NOK :-P

It would also be cool to have a &#x27;thought proces&#x27; that will make this 
usefull in BLD cubing.. 

In Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method, I can often succesfully apply 
commutators, solving 2 edges (orientation and permutation) at once 
in a lot of cases. For corners however, it is much harder...

Unless your task is really ugly or your computer is from stone age,

          <div class="email-content">See my recent posts (and Stefan&#x27;s helpful replies) about the 
Megaminx mech.  I have links to photos.  Once you take it apart, you 
will probably notice that some centers are looser than others.  You 
can remove the center cap and adjust the screw.  That should fix the 
popping.

Then go ahead and lube both puzzles with just a few drops of 
silicone oil (or spray if you prefer).  The Eastsheen 4x4x4 (Meffert 
Mini) mechanism is less forgiving than a Rubik 4x4x4 for alignment, 
but will turn very smoothly when lubed.  I can solve it in about the 
same time (Rubik or Eastsheen) but you do have to adapt your finger 
technique slightly to each version.

I remembered Jess isn&#x27;t dead either, so I emailed him and he said a 
friend scrambled for him. Now I&#x27;ve asked for the reason he was so much 
slower than expected.

          <div class="email-content">possibly bias. well, it looks like hungarian cubes are best, but heck,
whatever. these can&#x27;t be that bad. it seems the regular rubik&#x27;s cubes
are getting progressively cheaper and crappier, but some that I bought
a few months ago work fairly well.. and of course some don&#x27;t..

just my two cents..

Pushing yourself through that type of exhaustion without motivation is 
very difficult.  As any person who runs track or cross-country or any 
type of racing sport, at the end when the body is completely filled 
with lactic acid, you&#x27;re not really going to move any faster unless 
someone is cashing you down or unless you&#x27;re trying to pass someone.  
Without the motivation, it&#x27;s hard to justify in your own mind the pain

A chosen snapshot? The combination here excludes even the possibility of &quot;one of two certain complement colours on top&quot;.

You can see he had blue, orange and white on the back face here:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/brent_counter.JPG

So if he used standard BOY then I&#x27;d say cube orientation was not fixed 
at all.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">True, some of the 2005 cubes were pretty irregular right out of the 
box.  However, the very latest 2006 DIY cubes are probably some of the 
nicest parts ever manufactured.  So I say they&#x27;re finally getting 
better.  Hope those parts soon make their way into Hasbro cubes.

As for the 1980s cubes, they varied in quality also.  Most likely it 
will have flat centers, so depending on your twisting style that will 
have implications for speedcubing.

Tyson, can you share the other angle?  You mentioned before that the

          <div class="email-content">Ignoring the centralmost slices on an odd cube and doing moves as
normal simulates the even order cube one less than your current cube.
 But having those slices there physically makes it less than ideal as
far as doing turns since they can be misaligned and block your other
turns, even though they don&#x27;t technically exist given the way you are
perceiving the cube.

          <div class="email-content">Okay... so how would you split the 5x5x5 to be a 4x4x4?  I don&#x27;t have one in
front of me, but it seems like you can&#x27;t simply pair the center slice with l
or r, because something like L&#x27;l&#x27; F2 Ll would force you to break the pair
apart.  Would you just ignore the center slices altogether?

It makes sense to me that you can always pair the center slices of an
even-order cube to make it odd (e.g. solving centers and edges first on a
4x4x4 and then solving as a 3x3x3), and actually end up with a solved cube
in the end.  But if you simulate a 4x4x4 with a 5x5x5 by ignoring center
slices, at the end of your &quot;solve&quot; your center slices are still probably
going to be screwed up, right?  I guess it gets the job done...

          <div class="email-content">Well I was actually hoping to get a prelubed cube from someone because 
I don&#x27;t have silicone here with me and I don&#x27;t have the time to go 
around researching what works best and all (I don&#x27;t remember what I 
used the first time but it wasn&#x27;t ideal).  

And yeah I can simulate a 4x4x4 by ignoring the centralmost slices on 
the 5x5x5.  However doing a 4x4x4 solve on a 5x5x5 is impractical and 
will just slow you down due to the extra slices getting in the way.

According to that test I am not a geek.
I placed in the &quot;geekish tendencies&quot; category - about 12.28% or so.
I did win geek site of the day once but it&#x27;s not one of the questions. :  )

So I&#x27;ve been hearing about this method of Fridrich where as you put in <br>
an F2L pair, you can easily know where the next one will be or how the <br>
F2L algorithm affects the other pieces around the cube.  Are there any <br>
videos of people using this method?  Isn&#x27;t this how Marcus Stuhr got <br>
his 15.15 average?  Marcus, I know you mentioned that you had a BLD <br>
solve on video on computer ready to be uploaded, but do you have any <br>
speed solves?  It would be interesting to see your cubing style and how <br>
it affects your reaction time in terms of F2L pairs.  I&#x27;m wondering if <br>
your 15.15 average was attained with hand speed, reduction of delays, <br>
or a combination of both?<br>

John Dobson is a great popularizer of astronomy.  While he was a 
Buddhist monk he invented the Dobsonian alt-az mounting, used in many 
amateur &quot;point and shoot&quot; telescopes.  

But his views on the nature of the Universe are 
somewhat &quot;unconventional&quot;.  You can read his thoughts at 

http://www.johndobson.org/jarticles.html

and perhaps draw your own conclusions.

It&#x27;s a good line, which applies to anything fundamental.  
If you answer a long enough chain of &quot;Why?&quot; questions, eventually you 
have to stop at something (currently!) regarded as fundamental and 
say: &quot;That&#x27;s just how it seems to be.&quot;  So in the end, what we are 
left with as an &quot;answer&quot; to our original &quot;Why?&quot;, is a very detailed 
description of /how/.

Ah, yes - that might get us back On Topic!  He has some harmless fun 
with those tornadoes, though.  

/Buddhist/ monk might be wrong, btw.  I&#x27;m very hazy about eastern 
religions, and even hazier about eastern-style religions in California.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

Yeah, I&#x27;ve been told Sebastien Felix uses multislotting... Which 
means that he pairs up an F2L pair as he inserts the first one.

I also heard that Patrick Bellenbaum learned how the F2L algs effect 
all the pieces, so he could use it in BLD speedsolving. I am not too 
sure about this, though...

About seeing how the F2L algs effect the other F2L pieces: I often 
know what the next F2L case is going to be, a lot of times I just 
feel it comming.. I guess most ppl who use F2L have this. And if I 
don&#x27;t exactly know which case the next pair is going to be, I try to 
figure out at least some information like, the orientation of the 
edge (will I have to rotate the cube next?), or the orientation of 
the corner (usually easy if it&#x27;s going to end up with white on top). 
But this isn&#x27;t a method of course... I never spent time making 
tables with different cases.. It&#x27;s only looking ahead :). 

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, there are a few easy cases that after awhile, we all learn to 
notice.  One case that comes to mind is the F2L algorithm where the 
corner is in place and the edge needs to be flipped.  If there are 
three oriented edges in the last layer, it&#x27;s very easy to position the 
last layer so that all edges are oriented for the OLL.

I checked on strangepuzzle and couldn&#x27;t find any videos of Marcus Stuhr 
though... does he have a website where he posts videos and such things?

I&#x27;m not sure where &quot;over here&quot; is meant to be, and whether it is in the 
US or the UK that he believes English has changed more.

There is no &quot;proper&quot; English anyway.  The language has changed a lot in 
both countries since the 17th century: US English and some dialects of 
British English retain a few &quot;archaic&quot; elements in vocabulary, past 
tenses of strong verbs, etc.  But they are only &quot;archaic&quot; from the 
point of view of someone who speaks the dialect of S.E. England.

He says he could make himself understood to people whose accents he 
couldn&#x27;t understand.  That is not surprising: the American accent(s) 
are familiar in the UK from imported films &amp; TV.  The flow is pretty 
much one way.  Also, some British accents /are/ fairly impenetrable at 
times.  :D

I made a few adjustments... Corrected a few mistakes, added some 
things about shoes and socks. Deleted the display bar in the applets.

I didn&#x27;t photoshop your sunburn away, though ;).

I also explained more about how to find the first three moves in a 
basic 8-move 3 cycle, because some people did not really understand 
where I got those from.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Matt!

I think 3 moves per second is a very good rate.. I think I average a 
little more than 3.5 moves/second. 

I think you can improve a lot on the F2L! I think I average about 30 
moves for the F2L and in the lower 50&#x27;s for the whole cube. 

I suspect you are using the standard F2L algorithms too much, and 
don&#x27;t know a lot of shortcuts. You can find some shortcuts here: 
http://www.puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/f2l/. Not all of them are 
usefull in speedcubing, but it gives some inspiration.

Yes, it does seem surprising -- you might have expected *some* 
influence from all those non-English-speaking settlers!

Maybe he has somehow got the notion that we all spoke the same way 
four or five centuries ago.  If he sees bigger regional variations 
within the UK today than within the US, he might imagine that 
American English has stayed closer to that &quot;original&quot; language, and 
that the British accents and dialects have emerged since then.  But 
there were &quot;always&quot; big regional variations here: cf. Chaucer &amp; 
Langland, who wrote in quite different dialects, both in C14.

It&#x27;s hard to guess what he might have been thinking to come up with 
that.

 I don&#x27;t think thats what you were going for, but I thought I&#x27;d give
you a heads up.  The NY/NJ cubers (Ian, Bob, etc.) are probably about
the same distance away, but in the other direction.

(I&#x27;m assuming you use Bob&#x27;s the numbering scheme)

Thanks for asking, you made me think about it again and I just 
realized my right hand is pretty much holding the cube while the left 
hand does all the work, and that despite the case being symmetric. So 
I gotta try mirroring it.

Right now I do it this way:
r&#x27; U&#x27; (x U) R&#x27; U&#x27; x l&#x27; l&#x27; U L U&#x27; R&#x27; U x

So now I&#x27;ll have to try:
l U (x U&#x27;) L U x r r U&#x27; R&#x27; U L U&#x27; x

Btw, here&#x27;s another alg for another OLL case I found recently:
L F&#x27; F&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U l D&#x27; (x U&#x27;) L&#x27;

Cheers!
Stefan

Google doesn´t find anything on &quot;Kinwalds weights&quot;. In Europe (or maybe; in the rest of the world) the viscosity is measured in &quot;stoke&quot;. You can buy silicon on 100, 1000, 10000 etc. stoke. Stoke is the CGS-unit for kinematical viscocity and one stoke= 10^4m^2/s.
But OK, you have your bushels, your inches and your Fahrenheit. So why not buy silicon in Kinwalds?

Here in the US, they are measured in Kinwald weights, where a high 
number like 80 means a heavy weight, and lower numbers like 10 or 25 
mean thinner weight.  I think in Europe there is a different scale 
but the same idea applies.

But this was something we all knew would happen right?  Eventually, 
someone will hit 8 seconds.  Macky had a 10.07 and an unofficial 
competition of ours.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m looking for cubers in the Philadelphia area, and especially cubers <br>
at the University of Pennsylvania.  My cousin goes to the University of <br>
Pennsylvania and knows a bunch of people on the staff of the newspaper, <br>
the Daily Pennsylvanian, who might be interested in writing an article <br>
about blindfold cubers.  They were interested in contacting me because <br>
I did some blindfold cubing on Beauty and the Geek 2 and I was once the <br>
world record holder, but it just wouldn&#x27;t do justice when there&#x27;s <br>
someone at their own school who can solve it in 1 minute 17 seconds for <br>
them not to include him in the article.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so if you go to the University of Pennsylvania, and you can <br>
cube, let me know.  And they definitely want to interview Marcus and <br>
see his skills into action.  Actually, Marcus, if you&#x27;re free, my <br>
cousin is in the dorm across the street and she&#x27;s interesting in <br>
meeting you just to see you solve the cube.  She&#x27;s seen me blindfold <br>
before, but I can&#x27;t memorize the cube in 15 to 25 seconds, so that <br>
would be very interesting to witness.  She&#x27;s also got a camera if <br>
you&#x27;re having trouble with your lithium battery.<br>
<br>
It seems that it&#x27;s possible to build a strong cubing community in <br>
Pennsylvania like we have here in Southern California, and with experts <br>
like Marcus in the area, it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to attract media <br>
attention.  Actually, Marcus, if you&#x27;re interested, I may be able to <br>
get you a spot on one of the morning news shows.  They would also be <br>
interested in other Philadelphia cubers... so just let me know.<br>

I am actually going to be at UPenn tommorow. But considering ive only
successfully bld cubed twice, my avg for reg speedcubing is only 24.5
seconds, and i am only 14 i dont think im the right person for the
article.

Haha, Yeah, about your BLD solve on BATG: I&#x27;ve seen people on the

seconds... They didn&#x27;t see it was edited... :)

I wonder if that was ignored by the scrambler?  Probably not based

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s antislice.  Just before that in the scramble, L R is
written without antislice shorthand.  What kind of program generates LA
sometimes and L R others?  I would think it would have been written as &quot;...
LA U2 LA ...&quot; or &quot;... L R U2 L R ...&quot;, not switching back and forth like
that.

My two cents...

have reconstructed it backwards with the video and I&#x27;m right after the

Again... I admit the possibility that the scrambling was wrong... so if 
it was, I&#x27;d really be interested in knowing.

Btw... you spent so much time watching the webcast... do you really 
have nothing better to do :-P?!?

not the preceding):

1. Hold U=white, F=green

Also, for the cross of course I can only guess the exact execution 
since it&#x27;s not on the video. The rest of the solve is pretty much 
exactly what Leyan did. Btw, F2L with 37 moves in about 8.23 seconds.

Part of the trick is to *make* moments brilliant
with good comments, i.e. interpreting something
into them that wasn&#x27;t really there. Remember the
BATG editing thread?

          <div class="email-content">Thanks to everyone who responded to my initial question.

I think I found out why the tiles come off so easily... the solvent in 
the spray lube dissolves the glue that keeps them on. My tiles were 
sticking quite nicely until I put on some 3M Teflon Silicone spray 
tonight and now they are peeling. Not a problem since I will likely 
order some cubesmith tile sets.

I did do as suggested and put on the silicone spray. Man, the thing is 
still really stiff. Hopefully there is some kind of a break in period 
where it will loosen up. Otherwise I am going to have to give this one 
away to a non-cuber as I can barely turn one of the sides with a finger 
(I have to use my whole hand).

Does it make a difference if you let the spray dry before you reassemble 
the cube?  I didn&#x27;t but read in one post to let it dry but it was 
already reassembled.

Slightly dissapointed that my cheapo cubie solution did not work, at 
least not yet! (more evidence you get what you pay for)

Great video analysis, Stefan.  Great solve, Leyan.  It&#x27;s fascinating 
to study it.

this is just awesome.  thanks for taking the time to sort that out.  
well done.


Lars:

x, y, z correspond to rotations of the whole cube.

y = rotate cube same direction as U
x = rotate cube same direction as R
z = rotate cube same direction as F

          <div class="email-content">i believe it makes a big difference if you let the
silicone dry, i have a set of edges and corners with
silicone dried on it, and if i put it together with a
center, it moves perfectly, while the original corners
and centers dont work as well...you should buy a new
cube and re apply the silicone, but be careful not to
put any on the stickers. the best cubes are the 15th
anniversary, but take off the stickers and get the
cubesmith ones.

the simple solution is actually the hardest. it has
the most moves, but w/e. if its the end your stuck
with, you need to read the text VERY carefully,
because it has the stupid flip the corners algorithm
(which i do not use) the R&#x27;D&#x27;R D one, and you dont
move the rest of the cube, just the very top layer
when ur done with one corner. and it flips the right
bottom top corner by the way...

CMLL is very nice, especially some very fast cases.

You&#x27;re gonna wanna use a fast recognition technique and work out which
corners are swapped over time, opposite way Gilles does it ;) That&#x27;s
what I&#x27;m doing, helps a lot in non-matching blocks.

Yeah, cube rotations... I always use this page to check algs
I post, btw:

And I just found out I can write comments as &quot;[...]&quot; so here&#x27;s the

          <div class="email-content">Well David...

In general, it can be interesting to read my page about commutators. 
(see www.solvethecube.co.uk). The part about cycling 3 corners also 
applies to the megaminx... And in fact, I use it to do the corner 
PLL, which is the last step in my megaminx LL.

One LL method is described here:

http://grant.tregay.net/cube/solutions/megaminx/index.html.

I use a slightly different method (I think fewer algs):

1. Orient edges: With F RUR&#x27;R&#x27; F&#x27; and it&#x27;s inverse.
2. Orient corners: With sunes, and some other 3x3 moves.
3. Posisitoin edges: With a couple of variations of the J 
permutations alg on the 3x3, by &#x27;moving around&#x27; some CE pairs around 
the LL.
4. Position the corners, I do it like Grant Tregay does.

If you want me to write down any of the algs I use, just tell me...

- Joël.

Maybe read pages showing how commutators work on a cube, and apply
them to your megaminx?..

          <div class="email-content">I use a longer &quot;look&quot; for these steps, and now that I&#x27;ve experimented <br>
a little in the last couple of hours, my new method goes as following:<br>
<br>
1. Orient edges, if star point is facing towards you, the one in the <br>
top left will stay the same orientation, and the other four are <br>
oriented using FURU&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27; or its inverse. (Fridrich algorithm)<br>
<br>
2. Permute edges, line one up with its side, do a Sune but reposition <br>
that same edge. Now, keep on doing it until you get three of them <br>
properly in its place, then look at the other two. If they&#x27;re correct, <br>
then move on. Depending on the Sune type you use (I use RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;[U2<br>
]) you&#x27;ll have to perform this differently. For my Sune, go to the <br>
incorrect edge on the right, perform the Sune again, and do another U.<br>
<br>
3. Permute corners, using Phillip Marshall Ultimate Solution&#x27;s Corner <br>
Series. Two of the corners will stay stationary while the other three <br>
cycle.<br>
<br>
4. Orient corners, using commutors.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s the easiest way for me, since it uses four algorithms that I <br>
know already.<br>

I think that CMLL can be the most efficient for cases where all pieces
are permuted already.

CoLLs I use
sune, antisune, doublesune
R&#x27;U2(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U)R

cll 
F(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)F&#x27;
(B&#x27;RB&#x27;)(R2U)(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)(RB2) for my backwards T orientation
I need something for the U orientation.
as with the T, the twisted corners face towards you.


THOM_1_what do you mean when you talk about corner recognition below?
  _2_ Can I steal your CMLL algs?  I&#x27;m about 2/3 done with my table.
Most of it is CLL, small % is COLL, and only 1 CMLL so far.  (I love
it though!)

<br>
Tomorrow at Harvard there will be a math competition for high school students, and one <br>
part of the schedule is mini-events that run in the afternoon. I have been invited to go to <br>
Harvard tomorrow to give a lecture to students about the cube. So I will give a <br>
presentation about some cube history, methods, how to derive the 4.3 x 10^19 <br>
configurations, and show a few pictures from competitions. The competition will provide <br>
30 cubes, but I don&#x27;t know if those are for participants to keep, or what they&#x27;ll do with the <br>
cubes.<br>
<br>
The Harvard-MIT Math Tournament website is here:<br>
http://web.mit.edu/hmmt/<br>

I will have pictures and (hopefully) videos that I can upload to my website after the events <br>
tomorrow.<br>

It&#x27;s easy, you just need to take more care to do things in the proper 
order.

Why? CMLL buggers with permutation.

1) Do the alg backwards, look at the facelets you usually do for COLL,
memorise :).

2) Of course you can steal my CMLL algs, but you&#x27;re going to have to
ask Gilles first, because I use all of his! :) 

The hardest thing in Gilles&#x27; table is that fact that some algs are
missing and you have to work them out yourself by doing algs
backwards, mirrored, in another dimension, etc. I&#x27;d much prefer if
they were treated as 48 seperate algs.

I&#x27;m doing a set right now ...  In which I just got a 27.xx solve a new PB.
I use VH and ZBF2L algs which suit my style.  I&#x27;m slow because I delay
so much.  I&#x27;m getting better and am going to learn empty slot algs
that I got from a post here.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Daniel!

Thank you so much for sharing your method! I can definately use some 
of the algorithms from that file... I have one comment about the 
last step, in case you run into a three cycle. 

For a 3-cycle on the F face, like the ones on page 14 (at the 
bottom), try this:

delta = R&#x27; / DR&#x27; / R
epsilon =  R&#x27; / DR / R

algorithm: D / F / delta /  F / epsilon / F2&#x27; / D&#x27;

This way you need to insert/remove a corner only twice, using a 
setup move ;).

Bye!!

Joël.

You&#x27;re happy with an 11-move alg when there&#x27;s one with 9?

Hey guys, 

I&#x27;m about the same though my fastest single solve so far is 26.42, 
(using Fridrich method or CFOP) I&#x27;ve gotten a few other 26&#x27;s and now 
often get high 20&#x27;s. I can usually manage at least one or two high 
20&#x27;s solves a day.
Best average is 34.14 but it&#x27;s usually around 37/39.

I&#x27;m curious about the empty slot F2L, I&#x27;ve heard about it before but I 
don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen any of the algs.


Keith :)

          <div class="email-content">I think pretty much the only thing you could do wrong is put the 
washer on the wrong side of the spring. It has to protect the plastic, 
not the screw head. Look here for a description of an earlier version:
http://www.nascarjon.us/dyi.htm

Haha, I just noticed even Jon spelled DIY wrong the same way :-)

Oops, was just trying on one this morning. Figured out that you do the 
Sune until the one on the right is correct, turn the thing so that 
you&#x27;re facing the right side, and keep on doing it until you get all 
the edges in the right place.

Ok, not really what you want, but I&#x27;ll tell you how I solve the 
megaminx: I solve the minx until the last layer and a corner edge-
pair remains unsolved. I&#x27;ll then solve the remaining 6 edges w/o any 
algs. Next I solve the corners with URU&#x27;L&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;+some easy setup 
moves. Works for me.

Well.. If you are a speedcuber, and you know what cycles are, the 
easiest method to get reasonable times would be this one:

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/

Of course others might have other opinions about this, but I think 
this method is a method that enables you to memorise and solve 
efficiently, and once you are blindfolded, you don&#x27;t have to think 
about anything at all. You just execute what you planned. 

I might be difficult to understand the method... If you need help, 
meet me on MSN: joel_vn [at] hotmail [dot] com. I like to help you.

Here is another site that describes another method:

http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/blindfoldcubing.html

Good luck!

Joël.

Another entry for the &quot;you know you&#x27;ve been cubing to much if ...&quot; 
list:

... if you realize that the above algorithm does nothing except U&#x27;, 
just by looking at it (i.e. before actually trying it on a real 
Megaminx).

But I understand the idea, and I&#x27;ll try it. I&#x27;ve been interested in 
something very similar already, and I should finally find out how to 
solve those last 6 edges (5 for 3x3) directly...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey

http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/ also describes a good system for 
the corners... I use that one for the 2x2... Not a lot of 
algorithms, but very efficient. You can combine it with other 
methods/ or change the order of the steps in special cases, to be 
even faster. And, being color neutral is very easy with this method: 
the patterns are very easy to recognise if you start with other 
colors, so you can always choose the easiest cases during 
preinspection.

Yeah, it *is* good. I&#x27;m gonna try your way for 3-cycles. Very easy yet 
fast.

The 9 move alg works the same way the corner-3-cycle PLL works in 9 
moves, so if you understand that one then you should be able to 
translate it to Megaminx :-)

Cheers!

It also works nicely for a double-swap... so in 35 out of 60 cases it 
saves 5 moves for permuting corners (not for the 24 five-cycles and 
the solved case).

Can you tell how many moves you need on average for the edges and how 
many for corners? I just tried one solve and corners were I think 
lucky, 18 moves (two 3-cycles). But edges took me way too long I think 
(I didn&#x27;t count...).

Judging from your times, I&#x27;d say you need more practice before you 
move on to COLL.  Make sure everything is solid and that you&#x27;re 
doing it all in under a minute before you learn 40 new algorithms.

Good luck!

thanks! i really appreciate it, ill check this sites out. i am

single solves using the 3x3, i like to explore other categories like 
the one-handed, blindfolded, but i don&#x27;t know about solving with 
feet. i&#x27;ll ask some questions if there are some parts that needs 
questions. and again, thanks! your currently no.10 on the world

I also do not see why one should need such a timer! JNetCube works

          <div class="email-content">right now im trying to put some more stuff in it like having it make seesion averages and stuff. If you want to make a timer easily I would reccommend learning Visual Basic. In linux i used a program called &quot;Gambas&quot; and it is basically Visual Basic but for Linux. I wrote a timer for linux because the timer that is given on www.rubiks.dk only works in internet exlporer (well it works with Mozilla, but the sounds don&#x27;t really work) and Linux doenst use Internet Explorer. And the other files on the yahoo speedcubing groups were made for windows and won&#x27;t owrk on linux so i just decided to make my own. I&#x27;m gonna try to ask permission to use the sound files from the rubiks.dk timer so i can put it into the linux timer so it can have sound. here is what my newest version of it looks like. I just need to fix a small problem with the scrmabling algorithms:

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Ron already mentioned it in a mail to the people we know/suspect to <br>
come to the upcoming German Cube Day, now I&#x27;d like to give a little <br>
more detail...<br>
<br>
The German Cube Day will be on a Saturday. Only seldomly do I have the <br>
chance to meet other cubers in real life. So when I do, I&#x27;d like to <br>
get the most out of it. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve decided to stay on Sunday as <br>
well, and I&#x27;ll be very happy if others do the same so we can spend <br>
some more time together. I have booked my trains already.<br>
<br>
I will arrive Friday April 21 at 15:03.<br>
I will leave Sunday April 23 at 19:09.<br>
<br>
I have also reserved five two-bed-rooms in the youth hostel for the <br>
night from Saturday to Sunday. It costs 18 Euros per person (*) not <br>
including dinner/breakfast which cost about 3.50 Euros extra each if <br>
you want it. Please let me know as soon as you know whether you&#x27;d like <br>
to stay until Sunday as well. I can still cancel or add rooms, but the <br>
earlier I know the better.<br>
<br>
If you want to make it depend on others, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;d like to stay if at <br>
least N others stay&quot; that&#x27;s ok, just let me know so I can collect and <br>
combine this data. I understand that reasoning, that&#x27;s why I took the <br>
first step so you know at least one cuber (me) *will* be there.<br>
<br>
You can reach me at &quot;pochmann at gmx dot de&quot;, please use &quot;GCD&quot; as <br>
email subject.<br>
<br>
(*) The 15 Euros is our overall average I was told for our main night <br>
Friday to Saturday. Normally beds in the large rooms cost a little <br>
less and in small rooms a little more. Sorry if that caused confusion.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Does &quot;linux&quot; really come with a standard graphical interface? What I 
really meant was that I&#x27;m curious how you would create a timer for 
linux that can *not* be used on let&#x27;s say Windows. Cause I believe 
most (or even all?) GUI&#x27;s for linux are also available for Windows, 
no? And I think most programming languages are available for both of 
these OSs, too, so I&#x27;d expect a simple program like this to work on 
both (at least the source code)... But I don&#x27;t know Gambas...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well I&#x27;m pretty sure that the program you made will not be compatible
with Windows since Gambas (and its libraries) seems to be only
available under Linux (but I might be mistaken).

Stefan, you are right you can use GTK+ or/and QT programmed GUI under
Windows as long as you have the associed libraries and you recompile
the program for Windows (as windows executable are different from
Linux ones). It&#x27;s probably also compatible with cygwin (without
recompiling it).

Before I got my stackmat, I used JNetCube, no problems...

And a little advice... don&#x27;t use kubuntu, go slackware or something,
it treats you like a kid....

 Stefan, you are right you can use GTK+ or/and QT programmed GUI under
 Windows as long as you have the associed libraries and you recompile
 the program for Windows (as windows executable are different from
 Linux ones). It&#x27;s probably also compatible with cygwin (without
 recompiling it).

doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t write one. i mean, if nothing else, it would be

the harm in writing your own timer?

Maybe everyone will like yours better and you will replace it! With
programming, reinventing the wheel is usually a lot of fun because it trains
you for the days when you decide to build something truly unique.

Besides that, it&#x27;s always fun to use your own stuff rather than programs
written by other people :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan!

Me and Kåre will be there from Thursday to Sunday. Our flight arrives
to Düsseldorf April 20, 1:55pm, so I guess we will be in Gütersloh 2-3
hours after that. Our flight back home leaves Düsseldorf at 4:10pm so
I guess we&#x27;re leaving around 12am on april 23. Are you saying that you
are arranging the bookings of the rooms, or should I do that myself??

I&#x27;m really looking forward to thiscompetition, and to meet a lot of
non-swedish cubers. I haven&#x27;t been able to cube lately because my
right thumb and lower arm is aching, but it&#x27;s getting better so I&#x27;m
ready to turn a few faces. :-)

Fridrich says on her page that it takes her about 35 moves for the 
f2l (7 moves per cross and corner-edge pair up). 28 moves is really 
great, if you can do it fast. I can normally do the f2l quicker if I 
can plan a 2x2x2 during the inspection time.

I did 10 solves with the edges, and I got these results (in moves):
12, 20, 19, 11, 12, 19, 12, 13, 16, 11
Avarage: 14.5 moves (I think)
Try to position edges in the top layer while bringing bad edges down 
in the slot. My megaminx kills my wrists.

Thanks! I also did 10 solves now and this is what I got:
12 12 13 12 14 9 8 9 20 23

I&#x27;m so annoyed by the costly mistakes at the end that I refuse to 
compute the average :-)

But I was terribly slow, I think mainly getting used to the relative 
order of the edges is hard for me now. I&#x27;ll practice this further, it 
does look very good. Hey Per, any hints how I can solve some corners 
along the last edges on the fly?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Macky&#x27;s page is very nice for nice.. I also used it. Important is: 
even if just a few pieces came out, its not a good idea to assamble 
the cube by sqeezing the parts in (like on some other puzzles). You 
have to use a screwdriver to take at least one screw of one of the 
centres out, then fit in the other pieces.

Good luck!

Joël.

Yes! I know what you are saying... That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get much 
sleep in Florida... Not because I love being tired and having jet 
lags :).

But in this case, I think I&#x27;ll just have to do whatever the Dutch 
guys do... That&#x27;s probably easier for me.

I am looking forward to seeing you again!

Hi Gunnar,

well... Ron asked me to reserve rooms at the youth hostel, so I&#x27;m 
doing that part, but Ron keeps track of who wants beds/rooms of those 
that we have reserved. That&#x27;s because not everybody wants to stay at 
the youth hostel or doesn&#x27;t know yet or whatever.

So far I have reserved 41 beds for the main night from Friday to 
Saturday. Earlier today Ron sent an email to the people already 
registered. I can see Kare but I don&#x27;t see you, so maybe you didn&#x27;t 
get that email? Kare is also listed with &quot;NO BED&quot;, so if you want that 
changed, let Ron know.

I have also reserved 10 beds (5 double rooms) for the night from 
Saturday to Sunday, since I was hoping some others might stay with me. 
I haven&#x27;t reserved beds for the night Thursday to Friday yet, though I 
probably will soon. Ron has asked me about it because 6-10 Hungarians 
will arrive Thursday night (and leave Sunday morning).

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">hi,<br>
i joined this group today and just wanted to introduce<br>
myself. <br>
my name is kyle simmons, im from Toronto Canada.<br>
i began solving the rubik&#x27;s cube about nine months<br>
ago. im not a really serious speedcuber, in that i<br>
dont go to competitions, but im not that fast anyway.<br>
thats is one reason i joined this group. the other is<br>
that there is only one other kid that can solve the<br>
cube in my area. he godsolves anyway. my current<br>
records are as follows:<br>
2x2x2 - 19 sec.<br>
2x2x2 - 53 sec.(one hand)<br>
3x3x3 - 49 sec.<br>
3x3x3 - aprox 5 mins(one hand)<br>
4x4x4 - only solved once<br>
5x5x5 - only solved 4 times.(about 40 mins)<br>
<br>
so im not really very good yet but my goal is to get<br>
to about 30 sec. for 3x3x3. i dont really practice<br>
much for anything else.<br>

&quot;Good strong BLD solve: D2 F2 U&#x27; F&#x27; D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; L F&#x27; D2 L F&#x27; L2 B2 F D&#x27;
F&#x27; U2 D2 B D2 L B2 U2 D&#x27;

Interesting you try reading the following, and then attempting the solve.

Edge Orientation: spot the hex-flip
Corner Orientation: The 5-corner twist is setup so you don&#x27;t need to
do setup moves, but you will have to rotate the cube slightly. Then,
there are three more corners to deal with.
Corner Permutation: The first group of 6 should be quick, but try to
fix the corner parity only using 14 moves. (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;)x3
Edge Orientation: Just go!&quot;

Good job. =)

Memorization was very easy on this one but there were a lot of 
steps; the corner orientations were such that all U/D colors were on 
the L face, and there were two pairs of corresponding 2-1-corner 
twist orientations across the U and D faces on the R face.  The 
corners took me the longest but in general there wasn&#x27;t anything 
gross.  The edges were very agreeable and didn&#x27;t have any real 
issues at all -- no pausing needed, especially the last step which 
usually requires a bit of finaggling to get it to work (since the 
edge permutation cycles were in two large cycles, usually I simplify 
until the end and then figure out how to arrange them, but in this 
case it was a quick setup to a PLL alg).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,

I wanted to let everyone know that my solve was fake.  I did not solve 
the Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded in 1:13.37 seconds.  (Though, when I hit 
the timer, I did indeed read 1:13.37.  Funny isn&#x27;t it?)  I saw the 
solve and decided to practice a few times just to see what type of 
execution I could do.  You&#x27;ll see that with a 23 second memorization 
time (which of course was fake...) the execution time was 50 seconds, 
which actually is quite doable.  Anyway, this fake solve brought up a 
few interesting points.

I think 23 second memorization is near impossible.  You&#x27;ll notice my 
tapping of the cube.  Did I actually look at each piece when i tapped 
it?  The tapping, as one may assume, is me going through each piece in 
the cycle.  Well, to go from one piece to the next in the cycle, you 
have to look at one position, process the piece, and then look to the 
next position.  You&#x27;ll see that I don&#x27;t really turn the cube so I&#x27;m not 
really &quot;looking&quot; at the next position because I memorized it 
previously, I already knew where it was.  This is, of course, unless my 
tapping was fake as well, but that would have been such a nasty 
distraction.

So I guess I&#x27;m very interested in what type of memory techniques are 
used to memorize the cube in under 25 seconds.  Even if I could look 
around the three-dimensional cube that fast, how can one process 
information in the mind so quickly?  If you could process information 
in a one-pass memorization format at 1 second per piece of information, 
memorization of the cube could take place in about 30 seconds every 
time.  That, my friend, would be absolutely beautiful.

Also, solving with absolutely no delays is very difficult at that 
speed.  If I&#x27;m moving a cube that fast, I&#x27;m focusing on the physical 
moving of the cubes.  If I slow down a little bit, which might increase 
the overall physical execution time of the cube by as little as five 
seconds, the execution would be mindless enough for me to think ahead.

Anyway, I have some interesting question regarding the way Marcus did 
the solve because 1:22 is 7 seconds faster than my fastest real solve.  
Again, sorry for lying to everyone.

The algorithm R U2 R2 F2 R&#x27; U2 F2 R U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 D R2 D&#x27; you used 
to orient four corners... where did you find that?  Did you find that 
in A-cube or something?  I&#x27;m wondering why you use this algorithm.  Is 
it because of hand pain or some reason?  Because for five moves more, 
you could execute that using a two generator (only R and U) and 
furthermore, the 22-move algorithm for the four corner twist way easier 
to execute than that 17 move pain in the butt you&#x27;re using.  Try a 
&quot;Double Sune (TM by Lars Petrus Grand Copywriter of All Cubing)&quot; + a 
U-permutation.  An example of this algorithm is:  (R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R 
U2 R&#x27;)(R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R).  I know the R&#x27; connected to the R2 
is redundant, but it illustrates the connectedness of the two 
algorithms and the speed at which it could be done with.  I would 
definitely suggest using this algorithm as opposed to the 17-move 
algorithm you have there.  I could easily shave off a few seconds.

Just to let you know, F D2 (L&#x27; B&#x27; L U&#x27;)x5 D2 F solves all six-edges 
much more quickly.

Your general solve technique is very similar to what I used to do.  
When I started BLD cubing in New Mexico, especially with the 
orientations, I favored simplicity over efficiency.  Unfortunately, the 
sheer number of moves with me moving at maximum hand speed still 
produced execution times of around 70 seconds.  I&#x27;m much better now 
that I&#x27;m able to find more artful solutions to corner orientations and 
edge orientations (see hex-flip).  For the corner orientation in this 
case, I did y&#x27; [(U2 R U2 R&#x27;)(U R U&#x27; R&#x27;)]x2 y and then solved the 
remaining three (which is probably faster unless your pair-corner 
orientation of Sunes is absolutely insane).

Anyway, you said you memorized this one relatively fast but didn&#x27;t give 
an actual time.  I typically don&#x27;t know the times of my memorization if 
I don&#x27;t look up at the clock.  Anyway, if you had 15 second 
memorization, that would leave under 70 seconds for the solve.  Your 
execution must be at the same hand speed as mine to accomplish this, 
and you must be lacking delays in totality.  How do you cube through 
this hand pain?

Also, is the reason that you remember these obscure BLD algorithms, 
such as odd 4-twists and corner diagonal permutations, but not OLL and 
PLL because you practice BLD more?  Why are you using algorithms such 
as (R2 U F2 U&#x27; F2 U&#x27; R2 U F2 U F2 U&#x27;) in favor of more rudimentary 
algorithms such as (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3, especially if algorithm retention is 
difficult for you?

By the way, my actual time for this solve was a big fat fail.

Don&#x27;t download the video.  It&#x27;s fake.  I was just curious what other 
people would do with the solve, and what better motivation to get 
everyone to try it when they think I did a 1:13?  Sorry for abusing all 
of your trust.  I&#x27;ll never do it again—I promise!

          <div class="email-content">Dear Mr.(Mike) Tyson of cube,
                  Sorry for hitting the same message 3 times(fighting with my key board).
                  Ha! Ha! At last you bit not only our ears but also our eyes. Do not take it seriously. It is just fun!!! I recently watched the video of Mike Tyson biting the ears of his oppenent. 
                  Hmmm. If you learn phonetic sound and its value system, memorising the cube in sub-20 sec is possible. You need to remember only 10 nouns for EP + CP. I will try my best to prove it. I am motivated and inspired.

  Hey J. Bernett Orlando,

Don&#x27;t download the video. It&#x27;s fake. I was just curious what other 
people would do with the solve, and what better motivation to get 
everyone to try it when they think I did a 1:13? Sorry for abusing all 
of your trust. I&#x27;ll never do it againI promise!

                 We learnt a lot from Ron uncle. I love him.
               You can visit my site www.freewebs.com/bernett. There you can find my techniques in memory techniques page. I am learning by attending memory workshops conducted by my dad at various places. I am lucky to attend many times.it helped me to master it.   Now it has started boring to learn the same techniques again and again. But when I apply the techniques in my learning school subjects, blindfold cubing, memorising numbers, cards etc are very interesting. 
  Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Gah I feel like I am always under interrogation by you Tyson, but 
here goes:

With regards to the corner orienting alg: I suppose you can do it 
that way, yes.  I just have a set of algs I use for certain corner 
cases.  This also allows for easier memorization.  For instance, 
when you see a Sune, you don&#x27;t think &quot;this corner has a twist of 1, 
this one of 2, etc&quot;.  You see the pattern and know what to execute. 
This move doesn&#x27;t hurt so much because it is nice and smooth for me; 
I found the move by using Cube Explorer.

&quot;Just to let you know, F D2 (L&#x27; B&#x27; L U&#x27;)x5 D2 F solves all six-edges 
much more quickly.&quot;

I have seen this alg somewhere before and it was interesting, but I 
tend to avoid moves that involve lots of L&#x27;s (I am not very good 
with my left hand in terms of triggering).  I tend to stick with 
algs that involve U, R, and F.


Also if you wonder about processing information quickly, I was 
hoping my DDR videos would help hint at this.  As you build certain 
reflexes to things you can glance at them or even do them without 
much thought.  Even if there&#x27;s a heavy arrow-load coming up the 
screen at 600+ beats per minute my fingers will just go 
automatically.  It&#x27;s strange when sometimes I will see a huge gross 
pattern and my hands are hitting them just fine, but my eyes are 
going &quot;how am I reading this? I can&#x27;t read this crap!&quot; For example, 
PSMO is something I can barely see consciously with my eyes at that 
speed, but my brain/hands are faster and can read them more 
quickly.  Consider when someone scares you -- you react before you 
consciously know what happened.  


I never said algorithm retention was hard, I just didn&#x27;t care to 
practice speedcubing much anymore.  I do it once in a while but not 
for speed.  If I want to practice visual+speed simultaneously I play 
DDR, lol.  

As for memorization time, I didn&#x27;t take note but I can estimate it 
was around this:

1.5 seconds for corner orientation, seeing all the U/D colors on the 
L face plus the easy pairs on the R face was too blatant to forget 
easily (the patterns on the R face I associate with a mental hook 
called a devil skull, similar to the cowskull OLL arrangement only 
the horns point &quot;up&quot; and not &quot;out&quot;).

4 seconds for the corners maybe.  If you start at corner 1 you find 
that it&#x27;s a very smooth curve as you turn the cube around, by this I 
mean you don&#x27;t have to flip the cube around crazily each time you 
see a new corner.  It starts on the left side and generally flows 
around to the right. I spent an extra second or so looking for that 
last corner pair.

A quick glance at the D face shows that everything&#x27;s fine down there 
in terms of edge orientation.  There&#x27;s an glaring orientation error 
on the F face on the right side, as well as the back (even more 
obvious since it&#x27;s correctly permuted).  The top layer has three 
wrong but the UF piece has a D color, so it&#x27;s fine).  This 
observation took maybe 3.5 seconds.

Edge permutations, I see an arrow shape in terms of vector 
placements for the first four edges in the cycle.  I keep my fingers 
on the edges as I observe.  This also helps you keep track and lets 
you know where not to look.  The second &quot;cycle&quot; curves down to a 
three-cycle vector-arrangement of edges going back with yet another 
curve starting from UF to DL identical to the one that begins this 
very cycle (UR to DF). If you understand vectors much, they can be 
picked up and thrown about.  The beginning &quot;vector&quot; here is the same 
as the &quot;end&quot; vector of the cycle.  In all, memorizing this took 7 
seconds I am guessing.  So a total of 16 seconds for memorization or 
so. Mind you that time is unusual and by no means average, but this 
solve is just loaded with streams and easy-to-recall patterns.

As for handspeed, it might differ from yours.  When I solve I don&#x27;t 
stop to think much unless there&#x27;s a really disgusting arrangement or 
parity error.  This solve did not have a parity error, at that.  
Also in terms of handspeed, the edges were very fast for me.  No 
awkward setups and very easy cycles.  Try the moves I listed above, 
they are quick to fly through.

Strangely enough I did not know of (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3! I will have to try 
this out.

With regard to fast memory techniques, all I can say is move things 
into the realm of reflex.  Stories and memory hooks and binary 
conversions are very effective for relays and larger cubes, but for 
the 3x3x3 at least, looking for recognizable corner patterns and 
thinking of cycles as visual vectors (Chris Hardwick can attest for 
the speedup in memory with this approach) will help tons.  It is 
also useful to practice learning where a piece should go relative to 
the cube.  If you see, say a red-and-yellow edge somewhere, you 
should instantly know where it should go relative to where you&#x27;re 
looking.  This will allow you to make a quicker vector arrangement.  

I am a little disappointed though! I thought that was a real solve.  
Why would you create a fake video?

Anyways hope that answers your questions.

Keep in mind that the cases I did was with 4 or 6 bad edges (since I 
didn&#x27;t want any lucky cases). I recently did a solve with the edges 
were solved in 7 moves, the corners take way to many moves, I think. 
Keeping a 2x2 block in the last layer is very easy, and could speed 
up the solving of the corners somewhat.

          <div class="email-content">Well,<br>
<br>
Lately I&#x27;ve been solving the bigger cubes (biggest so far is 10x10) I<br>
started on thursday I think with 7x7, then friday 8x8, saturday 9x9,<br>
and sunday 10x10 (I did a 6x6 too)  And I am trying to find the most<br>
efficient way of doing these, and I think it can apply to 5x5 as well.<br>
<br>
Ok, here goes...<br>
1: Solve all Centers<br>
2: using the (Ll) F&#x27; L F (Ll)&#x27; Solve the white edges and put them in place<br>
3: Put in first layer (white) corners<br>
4: Solve the &quot;middle&quot; edges (like the cage) so it solves them<br>
directly, and you won&#x27;t have to solve as 3x3 at the end.<br>
5: Solve LL corners<br>
6: Solve LL edges (using 3 cycles, or commutators or whatever you want)<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I woke up this morning and this was the<br>
first thing that came to my mind.  It solves all the pieces directly,<br>
so you don&#x27;t have to do anything extra at the end.  I&#x27;ll try it today<br>
sometime hopefully.<br>

Memorization was very easy on this one but there were a lot of 
steps; the corner orientations were such that all U/D colors were on 
the L face, and there were two pairs of corresponding 2-1-corner 
twist orientations across the U and D faces on the R face.  The 
corners took me the longest but in general there wasn&#x27;t anything 
gross.  The edges were very agreeable and didn&#x27;t have any real 
issues at all -- no pausing needed, especially the last step which 
usually requires a bit of finaggling to get it to work (since the 
edge permutation cycles were in two large cycles, usually I simplify 
until the end and then figure out how to arrange them, but in this 
case it was a quick setup to a PLL alg).

  Well,

Lately I&#x27;ve been solving the bigger cubes (biggest so far is 10x10) I

efficient way of doing these, and I think it can apply to 5x5 as well.

Ok, here goes...
1: Solve all Centers
2: using the (Ll) F&#x27; L F (Ll)&#x27; Solve the white edges and put them in place
3: Put in first layer (white) corners
4: Solve the &quot;middle&quot; edges (like the cage) so it solves them
directly, and you won&#x27;t have to solve as 3x3 at the end.
5: Solve LL corners
6: Solve LL edges (using 3 cycles, or commutators or whatever you want)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bernett,

That method is similar to the method I was talking about, but not the 
same.  Right now I use a modification of Per&#x27;s cage method, and 
average between 5 and 6 minutes with it.  I tried to learn the 
convert to 3x3x3 way back when, but didn&#x27;t want to memorise all the 
algorithms for the last 2 edges, I&#x27;d be able to do it now because of 
my knowledge of 3 cycles and the like.  But I think that solving 
everything directly like this is a lot like Per&#x27;s cage method, except 
you get more freedom for the centers.  THat is pretty much the only 
advantage of this over the cage method.  I&#x27;ll try it during my spare 
which is next period.  I&#x27;ll let you know what I think about it.

Ah, ok... yeah, I didn&#x27;t look for that. I think my first 9-mover had 
all edge oriented already. The 8-mover had two badly oriented I think, 
but overall the situation was easy to solve (obviously :-).

What are your times for the whole Megaminx, and what for those last 6 
edges and 6 corners?

Yes, welcome to the group. However, if you are from Toronto, Canada, 
you are mistaken in stating there is only one other kid in your area 
that can solve the cube.  There are a few cubers in the GTA.  Some 
are quite fast, too.  

What does it mean this other kid of which you speak &quot;godsolves&quot;?  
Does that have something to do with God&#x27;s Algorithm?

(F E2) (R&#x27; F R U)*5 (E2 F&#x27;)
or
(R&#x27; D&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; F)*5 (U D R)

A while ago, you said you have a 9 move threecycle for the LL 
corners (with corners already oriented)... I asked for the alg, but 
you didn&#x27;t give it :s... Can you give me the alg you use for that?

A &quot;while&quot; ago? Wasn&#x27;t that just the day before yesterday? :-)

I did answer that it&#x27;s basically the same as for 3x3, but I didn&#x27;t 
explicitly write it down cause I thought you&#x27;d find out yourself, and 
more importantly because of the lack of common notation for Megaminx :
-)

Ok, I&#x27;ll try...
(R2 DR&#x27; R) L2 (R&#x27; DR R) L2&#x27; R2

Is that understandable/correct? It&#x27;s not at all like I&#x27;d execute it, 
but I tried to use the same faces you and Daniel used.

Cheers!
Stefan

Uh, to make it more obvious, let me write it down as a conjugated 
commutator:
R2&#x27; [R&#x27; DR&#x27; R, L2] R2

For 3x3, it would be 
(R B&#x27; R) F2 (R&#x27; B R) F2 R2
or
R2 [R&#x27; B&#x27; R, F2] R2

In Daniel Hayes notations, L and DR commute, so do L and R... So 
your moves don&#x27;t really do anything at all... I&#x27;ll try to figure it 
out though..

I also had a hard time with the notation, btw.. :)

Yeah ok... comes from his sick way of holding the Megaminx :-). 
Looking at his notation diagram I must replace my R with D, then we 
have:

(D2 DR&#x27; D) L2 (D&#x27; DR D) L2&#x27; D2

Perhaps I&#x27;ve misunderstood your proposal:

Surely you /will/ still end up with 2 swapped edges (5x5x5 &quot;wings&quot;) in 
50% of cases.  If so, 3-cycles won&#x27;t be enough.

  Oddly enough...I used to be really in to computer cubes and then
took about a two year break.  Just last week I got involved again, and
my upcoming goal is to solve the 20x20x20 in sub-2hrs.  But anyway, I
use David Barr&#x27;s applet on www.puzzlingaddiction.com (follow the
links), and the neat thing about it is it will record the times you
get for solving each different cube, and record them in a database. 
Then if you visit the best times list, you will find everyone else&#x27;s
solve, and by clicking on them, you will be able to see how they were
solved.

  So if you are looking for methods that some people use, I would
suggest checking out that site.  By the way, where do go to find those
larger order cubes?

 Yes, welcome to the group. However, if you are from
Toronto, Canada, 
 you are mistaken in stating there is only one other
kid in your area 
 that can solve the cube.  There are a few cubers in
the GTA.  Some 
 are quite fast, too.  
 
 What does it mean this other kid of which you speak
&quot;godsolves&quot;?  
 Does that have something to do with God&#x27;s Algorithm?
 
 -Dave Campbell

i only mean in my school or in the etobicoke area that
i know. and yes, he solves for the least moves posible
with no time limit, i have heard of this being called
&quot;godsolving&quot;. actually, i found out today that he has
joined this group (i think) but has not yet posted.

That&#x27;s generally referred to as fewest moves solving in the cubing
community.

 Can you tell how many moves he usually needs (and how
he counts)?
 
 Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">i JUST bought the 4x4 eastsheen minicube. when I opened it up to lube it, I hadn&#x27;t planned on taking out any pieces... but, when I did so, it ended up knocking a few pieces out. I had to take an hour or so to re-assemble the cube. When I was done, i was extremely happy.. it turned great.<br>
   <br>
  Today the cube was dropped from approximately 3 ft up onto carpet (NOT by me), and afterwards, it stopped working. U turns work, D works, L, R, F, B, etc all work. However, I could not turn horizontally at the middle. IE, I could not do any u or u&#x27; moves.<br>
  <br>
I took off all the center caps. i tried to figure out what was wrong. I noticed that when all the center caps are off, you can see through between adjacent sides. However, between the L and F faces, it seemed there was a piece jiggling around in there, and I could not see through as I could on every other edge.<br>
   <br>
  I tried to fix it. I couldn&#x27;t.., all that I was able to do was end up knocking out tons of pieces, and evnetually I decided to start ALL over. I disassembled the cube completely.<br>
   <br>
  I reassembled it. It took THREE HOURS. When I was done, after a little bit of tightening and adjustment, the cube worked great.I was then playing with it a little bit (using it to simulate a 2x2 cube, so I was doing only r, l, u, d, moves, etc), when all of a sudden, I noticed that the same problem was happening again!!!!!!!!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well it&#x27;s 2:25AM and I have school at 8.00, but I did manage to get the cube working again. However, I realized once i put it together that I switched 2 edges. So, I switched 2 center pieces b.c i figured that might make it solveable. Is this right?
   
  (btw, where is a GOOD applet/program for solving this cube, beacuse i am TIRED of reading &quot;left down&quot; &quot;inner right up&quot;...)
   
  More importantly: What do people think about eastsheen 4x4s? Are they as horrible as my experience with them has been thus far? What can I do to make the best of my 4x4 experience?
   
  Thanks!!!

Maybe it helps when you use Macky&#x27;s page to assable your cube 
again...

Did you try to assamble it by sqeezing the last few pieces in? 
Because that&#x27;s awkward to do, and it will result in a not-working-
4x4.

Marcus, any particular reason you didn&#x27;t do this as (D&#x27; S D2 S&#x27; D&#x27;)? 
Did you purposely restrict yourself to only PLL algs? If I remember 
correctly, in a recent post in the blindsolving forum you made 
extensive use of that nice 4/5 move 3-cycle using the S-slice.

Cheers!
Stefan

  How do you like the Eastsheen cube? I have used hte Rubik.com 5x5 cubes and it (admittedly) doesn&#x27;t get as smooth as the Eastsheen one, but it seemed to never really lock up. I am aware that the 4x4 and 5x5 are different, but I assume the rubik&#x27;s.com 4x4 is similar to the 5x5. 
   
  Bottom line: Eastsheen has made a very bad first impression on me, and I just want some reassurance that I have a quality cube which isn&#x27;t going to break quickly or slow me down -.-

          <div class="email-content">Maybe I can help.

What I found happens is that, on the eastsheen 4x4, the inner edge 
simulators get dislodged.  First, let me clarify.  Eastsheen 4x4s 
are the same exact things as 5x5&#x27;s, except the M, E, and S slices 
are internal and invisible.  Basically, you have to pinpoint 
the &quot;problem edges&quot; by seeing which slices can split (ie the M 
slice, E slice, S slice), and which edge pairs change a slice 
from &quot;bad&quot; to &quot;good&quot;.  For each edge pair identified as a &quot;problem&quot;, 
take out the two visible edges along with the inner edge simulator 
(IES) that&#x27;s between them.  Then put the IES back in (easier than a 
3x3 edge), slide it to one side and put the edge in that belongs on 
the other side.  Then, slide the IES dead center, and push the other 
edge in.  If you get used to it (like I did from the many, many 
times mine popped inside), its not bad.  I made a little video of it 
at http://tinyurl.com/msaaa

Now for the other questions

Personally...4x4, I vastly prefer the rubik.com one.  It doesn&#x27;t 
have that stupid internal popping that I described above (although 
it does pop fairly often).  Also, it gets caught on itself less 
often.  5x5...well, my rubiks 5x5 is semicrappy...well, I can&#x27;t 
break it in or I won&#x27;t be able to write for a week, it&#x27;s so stiff 
right now...but my eastsheen one aint too bad.

Rubiks 4x4 is very different from 5x5.  5x5 is basically a two-
layered spherical core, the pieces that come from the 3x3 go all the 
way to the center while the others just kinda fit in around them on 
the top layer.  4x4 is a ball on the inside with the centers in 
little ridges in the ball, with the other pieces fitting in around 
them.  It might sound similar, but its not really.

Hope everything made sense, it&#x27;s 11 PM and I&#x27;ve been at play 
rehearsal since 3 so I might be talking jibberish and not notice.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m reminded of how chess masters can be shown a complex chess  <br>
position for a fraction of a second, and remember it exactly. Not  <br>
because they have fantastic memorization techniques, but because they  <br>
UNDERSTAND chess so well. Or how most of us can spot complex emotions  <br>
on a face immediately. That one&#x27;s mostly instinctual, but it shows  <br>
the visual/cognitive processing power we have and can tap into.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t see any reason why people couldn&#x27;t, with a lot of talent and  <br>
years of dedicated practice, do the same thing with a 3x3x3. It  <br>
doesn&#x27;t hold more information than a face or a chess position.<br>
<br>
People have only begun to scratch the surface of what&#x27;s possible to  <br>
do in blindfold cubing.<br>

&gt; around the three-dimensional cube that fast, how can one process<br>
&gt; information in the mind so quickly?  If you could process information<br>
&gt; in a one-pass memorization format at 1 second per piece of  <br>
&gt; information,<br>
&gt; memorization of the cube could take place in about 30 seconds every<br>
&gt; time.  That, my friend, would be absolutely beautiful.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars,<br>
<br>
Sure... people have only begun to scratch the surface of what&#x27;s <br>
possible to do in blindfold cubing, which is why I do not believe <br>
people can memorize in 10 seconds at this point.  Maybe later, but <br>
right now, I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone dedicated enough to the sport.<br>
<br>
Someone who could come close to memorizing in 10 seconds, 15, or even <br>
20 seconds, would have to have practiced the cube very much... just <br>
like the chess masters you&#x27;re talking about.  They would be able to <br>
give us novel insight to the sport.  I have yet to see anyone produce <br>
this kind of knowledge regarding blindfold cubing... except for maybe <br>
Stefan.  Stefan&#x27;s just holding back because he doesn&#x27;t want to make me <br>
feel bad.<br>

&gt; UNDERSTAND chess so well. Or how most of us can spot complex emotions<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t see any reason why people couldn&#x27;t, with a lot of talent and<br>

You can rotate the whole cube, but you can&#x27;t hold onto
individual layers like at

Ok, thanks. I guess I should&#x27;ve been more clear what I meant about how 
he&#x27;s counting. I meant for example whether he counts R2 as one or two 
moves. But with 68, it doesn&#x27;t matter much, sorry to say this but it&#x27;s 
very long :-).

Um... I disagree. What you mentioned, that chess players can memorize 
a chess situation very quickly, that&#x27;s only for *real* chess 
situations coming from a *real* game that makes sense. If you give 
them *random* boards they&#x27;re not any better than other people (oh 
well, probably better than the dumbo on the street who doesn&#x27;t even 
know what chess is). But in blindsolving we&#x27;re dealing with *random* 
cubes, so that&#x27;s not comparable to chess masters memorizing a 
meaningful chess situation.

Cheers!

To answer this, we must know some more:

- You mean pure flip (like in BLD) or maybe OLL cases?
- What algs do you know? With 2048 algs you never need setup moves.

Yes, you can tell my scrambler to turn each of the four things (you

With two setup moves:
(f M) (R2 F2 R2 U2 M&#x27; U M U2 R2 F2 R2 U) (M&#x27; f&#x27;)

However, &quot;my alg&quot; fits better into your set moves:
D2 F2 R2 (R2 F2 R2 U2 M&#x27; U M U2 R2 F2 R2 U) R2 F2 D2
= D2 (R2 U2 M&#x27; U M U2 R2 F2 R2 U) R2 F2 D2

Umh, better write it like this:
D2 (R2 U2 M&#x27; U M U2 R2 F2 R2 U R2 F2) D2

Hey, nice &quot;new&quot; 4-flipper in there. Too bad it&#x27;s quite slow :-)

I don&#x27;t know where I read this first, but now Google quickly found 
this:
http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/learn/html/e.8.1.html

Quote:
&quot;[...] human chess masters are far more accurate than non-chess 
players at remembering chess board positions taken from real games, 
where the placement of pieces arose in strategic play and represented 
meaningful tactical positions. However, these masters were no better 
than non-chess players at memorizing random arrangements of pieces.&quot;

Do you remember a place where I could read about these results? The 
research I&#x27;ve found so far allowed 3-5 seconds to look at the board, 
then they looked how much the players remembered. And not even the 
grand masters remembered the whole board exactly. So that&#x27;s quite a 
different result.

Here&#x27;s two pages I&#x27;ve found describing results of studies of Chase and 
Simon as well as of de Groot (search for &quot;random&quot; inside the pages):

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
I just got my mefferts megaminx, since there are so few on ebay, I<br>
bought there one. The problem is, that when I turn left, the center<br>
piece acts like a screw drive and the screw is coming out! I could of<br>
course try to solve it by only turning right (clockwise), but that is<br>
not good of course. Stefan, you&#x27;re an expert, maybe you can help? I<br>
registered for megaminx at GCD, but now I can&#x27;t even learn it :(<br>
If the crew would be glued to the core, I think it could turn good,<br>
but maybe I glue the center too...<br>
Help!<br>

well when you talk about a random cube,
you don&#x27;t include cubes with 20 blue
and 13 yellow stickers either...
so why include chessboards with 3 kings?
it just seemed logical :-)

but i&#x27;ll go read the articles stefan linked
now. maybe they specify it in there...

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I play blindfold chess and am now working on blindfold cubing.  I&#x27;ve 
made my own connection with it;  For EP, I memorize edges as a 
combination of numbers and letters.  I now have it split A-F and 1-6.

If I run into a position that has:  D4F3 in sequence, I&#x27;m able to 
visualize a chess position.  Obviously this doesn&#x27;t work with every 
combination of letters/numbers, but my comfort with bld chess helps 
in certain situations.  I know this probably wasn&#x27;t the direction the 
thread was going, but it works for me because it has personal appeal.

I also used to be a huge basketball fan, so certain combinations of 
numbers become useful.  (i.e. 23=Jordan, 45=Jordan&#x27;s return, 
21=Duncan, etc, etc.)  

As previously mentioned, I&#x27;m new to bld cubing, but the above 
mentioned strategies has helped with getting my EP under control.

Thanks to Tyson for encouraging me to divvy up the solution.  A bit 
more work with EP and CP and I&#x27;ll get a successful solve in. 
(hopefully)

Happy cubing and stay friendly

-Richard

You&#x27;re of course right that it&#x27;s only for meaningful positions. I&#x27;m  
not sure it invalidates my claim, but maybe it does.

I would argue that to a cuber, all cube positions are meaningful.  
Just the fact that they&#x27;re random doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re hard to  
memorize/recognize. But maybe it is somehow fundamentally a much  
bigger harder problem in some way.

It would be interesting to know how the number of possible  
&quot;meaningful&quot; chess positions compares to the number of possible cube  
positions. Not that that conclusively proves anything, but it&#x27;s an  
indicator.

I got the &quot;fraction of a second&quot; from memory, and as you found that  
memory was a exaggerated by a factor of 10. Make your own &#x27;irony&#x27; joke.

Are there any other comparable cases of instant recognition that  
people do? I haven&#x27;t had my coffee, so I can&#x27;t think of any. I&#x27;m  
thinking less of conscious memorizing of symbols and more about  
things that plugs into our instinctive abilities. That&#x27;s often  
thousand of times faster.

Don´t you think a chess master would catch this position in less than, 
say 20 seconds?

I think it is a fundamentally different thing. Of course you can take 
a scrambled cube and interpret some meaning into it (e.g. the four 
corner orientations in the L layer look like &quot;the wheel&quot;) but so can 
the chess masters for random chess boards (e.g. those three pieces are 
lined up as &quot;pin&quot;).

A chess game always starts with the same state (unless we&#x27;re talking 
about Fischer&#x27;s random chess) and goes on from that in meaningful 
ways. A cube on the other hand starts scrambled, i.e. is meaningless 
right from the start, and only becomes &quot;more meaningful&quot; the closer 
you get to the solved state.

Ok... um... damn... I&#x27;m not good at joking when I&#x27;m expected to. I 
also can&#x27;t tell jokes.

An important aspect is that we&#x27;re looking for *exact* memorization. 
You can&#x27;t make a single mistake or else you&#x27;ll get DNF. Also, the 
memorized object should be &quot;random&quot; and have many different possible 
states.

I can&#x27;t think of any right now, either. Anyone?

Here&#x27;s one thing that just came to my mind, e.g. memorizing 40 bits in 
1 second:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html

Though, it&#x27;s more technique and practice than the &quot;instinctive&quot; you 
asked for.

The only thing required for a 4x4 to be solvable is for the corner

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

yeah that would certainly minimize the number of two digit numbers, 
but I would still have to worry about 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 if 
I used hex.

I mean maybe this isn&#x27;t a problem trying to keep 18 seperate from 1 
followed by 8, but I&#x27;m new to this and wanted to ask if there was a 
good technique in terms of using those pneumonic word systems.

But yeah, maybe doing this in hex would make things easier, since it 
gives me 6 fewer pieces to know.

Actually maybe I could include consonant clusters too.

So 0-9 could be the normal stuff, and maybe 10=ch 11=sh 11=st 12=str 
13=gl 14=cl 15=sp 16=spl 17=tr 18=fr 19=bl 20=fl 21=shr 22=lm 23=rd 
24=th

so (1 7 24 19 17 6 20 10 15 9 14 11 3 12 18 21 23 11 8 5 4 22) which 
is the scramble on my 4x4 right now could be translated to the 
sounds:

(t ck th bl tr g fl sh sp b cl st m str fr shr rd st f l r lm)

and that could become the phrases

TaCK THe BLue TRue Goo FLaSH.  SPee BaCkLe ST (Mouth STReet) FRies 
SHRei RD STaFF Lo ReaLM.

Ok so that is a pretty nonsensical phrase, but I break it down like 
this.  &quot;TaCK THe BLue TRue Goo FLaSH&quot; is not hard to remember 
because of the alliteration, though it is meaningless.  Just focus 
on the sounds.  &quot;SPee BaCkLe ST (Mouth STReet)&quot; I picture as a 
street hotdog vendor on Speebackle St. and they Fry hotdogs so much 
better than the staff of the hotdog stand on Shrei RD that they put 
them to shame (low realm).

Again it sounds weird, but I think this would be much faster than 
memorizing visually.

My question is that I highly doubt my number/sound correspondence is 
proven to work well.  Is there one where I can utilize 24 distinct 
sound/consonants/consonant clusters that is proven by memory masters 
to work well?

    hi,
 i know this is the slow way of solving the cube but...
 does anyone know how to solve the problem in the
 attachment? (sorry for the bad drawing)
 i realize that the wireframe or &quot;outside in&quot; method is
 easier than top down or middles then top down, but its
 what i have to work with at the moment. the rest of
 the cube is solved.

Try encoding not 0-99 but 00-99, so you don&#x27;t encode 1 and 8 but 01 
and 08.

You&#x27;ll find the exact same translation from digits to sounds in books 
of different high-profile memory masters. I think it&#x27;s the standard, 
haven&#x27;t seen something with more sounds yet. They probably don&#x27;t need 
more, for memorizing numbers 10 sounds is all they need and the next 
higher I think would be playing cards, and I doubt you have 52 enough 
different sounds :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Btw, it&#x27;s phonetic, not pneumonic :-)

          <div class="email-content">Here is something I&#x27;ve been tweaking around with but let me know
what you think.  The following is mainly something I&#x27;ve been
thinking about with respect to centers, but it could certainly apply
to edges and the like as long as you define edges in consistent
groups of four:

blue = 1 white = 2 red = 3 yellow = 4 orange = 5 green = 6

Now, say we have the following colors for a group of four elements:

blue green
white red

Which translates to

16
23

Now, I tried making the following table with increasing numbers down
one side with the first six most-prevalent consonants in the English
language for the main row.  Consider the top number of the previous
set, 16, and the bottom, 23.  If the first digit is greater than the
second of a given number, subtract them.  If it is smaller, add.
Doing so for all possible combinations will yield the following
table (arbitrarily defining a case where if the two numbers are
equal, they become 12):

    t    n    s    h    r     d
12 (66) (55) (44) (33) (22) (11)
1  (65) (54) (43) (32) (21)
2  (64) (53) (42) (31)
3  (63) (52) (41)      (12)
4  (62) (51)      (13)
5  (61)      (14) (23)
6       (15) (24)
7  (16) (25) (34)
8  (26) (35)
9  (36) (45)
10 (46)
11 (56)

To remember the consonants, think &quot;tin shard&quot; without the vowels.

Notice the general pattern of how the numbers are arranged.  This
can be reconstructed from memory if need be.

(The general rule: Given your number, after determining whether or
not to add or subtract, the sum/difference will equal the number on
the left.  If you subtracted, the left digit will denote its
relative position in the table from the right side, and if you
added, it will be the right digit instead denoting that same
relative position.)

Using the above table on the numbers (16) and (23) from the colors
above, we have

t7
h5

Changing the righthand numbers to letters:

tghe
Forming a wordphrase:
tag hoe

For this I would imagine someone playing tag with... a stripper, or
maybe a gardener.  Your choice.  The idea here is that you can make
whatever words (length, number of words, etc) you want as long as
you can extract the letters in an every-other-letter fashion
beginning with the letter of that given word.  For
example, &quot;bullseye&quot; would be blsy but &quot;big tip&quot; would be bgtp due to
it being two words.

Now, say you&#x27;re in the middle of a solve and your memory hook for a
side was &quot;Road Hole&quot; or something (imagining a pothole or something
for the hook itself).  Taking every-other letter within a given word
we have:

ra
hl

or

r1
h12

or

(21)
(33)

or

white blue
red red

The idea here is to simplify 24 objects into 6 visual phrases that
can be easily broken back down.

I&#x27;d like to announce that I&#x27;ll be awarding a small prize to anyone <br>
that breaks an &quot;Official WCA World Record&quot; as recognized by the WCA <br>
and www.speedcubing.com <br>
<br>
If you happen to set one of these records in an official arena then <br>
I&#x27;ll award you one free custom logo set (Option A)!<br>
<br>
There is a last man standing rule, meaning that if you set a record <br>
you must retain it for at least 24 hrs before I&#x27;ll award a prize.  <br>
This allows for the same record to be broken at the same tournament or <br>
at another tournament the same day.  This wouldn&#x27;t be  necessary but <br>
I&#x27;ve seen it happen before (Tyson/Leyan).<br>

     hi,
  i know this is the slow way of solving the cube but...
  does anyone know how to solve the problem in the
  attachment? (sorry for the bad drawing)
  i realize that the wireframe or &quot;outside in&quot; method is
  easier than top down or middles then top down, but its
  what i have to work with at the moment. the rest of
  the cube is solved.

they last as long as you don&#x27;t chip them off with your nails etc.

I personally grew to dislike the textured tiles. go for the smooth
ones. the textured ones tend to get slippery... yes, paradoxical..

          <div class="email-content">I  guess you are all trying to devise a system to memorise the 24 edges using phonetic sound and its value system. 
   
  There are only 10 phonetic sounds, even for memorising 52 playing cards. Let me give you some ideas for naming all the 24 edges in 4*4*4 using the phonetic sound and its value( using only 8 sounds).
   
  1). First of all, classify the 24 edges into 3 categoris based on their positions, say TOP LAYER EDGES(8 EDGES), MIDDLE LAYER EDGES(8 EDGES) and BOTTOM LAYER EDGES(8 EDGES). 
  2). Number them(each laer) from 1 to 8 seperately in any order you like.
  3). Coining/creating word(noun) for each piece.
         a). Top layer edges name should start with T, Middle layer edges name should start with M and Bottom layer edges name should strat with B.
         b). All layer edges name should end with the phonetic sound of the number of the edge.
         c). Introduce the no value letters( a,e i, o, u, w, h, y or any silent letter) in between the first letter (T, M or B) and the phonetic sound lettersto create a noun word which can be easily vizualised as a picture.
         d). That is the word for particular piece.
  Example :- TyRe is top layer 4th edge
                  MoweR is middle layer 4th edge
                  BeaR is bottom layer 4th edge
   
                     If you want to memorise 2 pieces in one word, then we should apply some advanced system using the same 10 phonetic sound and its value.     
                     Hope it makes sense and may be helpful to you all. If not plz ignore it.

Try encoding not 0-99 but 00-99, so you don&#x27;t encode 1 and 8 but 01 
and 08.

You&#x27;ll find the exact same translation from digits to sounds in books 
of different high-profile memory masters. I think it&#x27;s the standard, 
haven&#x27;t seen something with more sounds yet. They probably don&#x27;t need 
more, for memorizing numbers 10 sounds is all they need and the next 
higher I think would be playing cards, and I doubt you have 52 enough 
different sounds :-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

As far as I know there are two main, popular, methods for solving the
edges and centers.  One is Stefan&#x27;s method (what doesn&#x27;t Stefan do
right?) and the other is called freestyle cycling.  Also look out for
a new one potentially coming soon, but I&#x27;ll keep it at least somewhat
quiet until the inventor comes posts about it.

Stefan&#x27;s approach works exactly like his BLD method does for permuting
pieces on the 3x3, you solve pieces one at a time using a buffer piece
and a location that you always setup an edge/center to.  I know the
basics of this method, but I&#x27;m not that good at it.  However this
method rocks, it&#x27;s very fast paced and you will be able to solve the
pieces quickly.

Freestyle cycling is what I do, basically you get to know and love
commutators and that&#x27;s all you use.  Just setup two edges (or centers)
onto the same slice and one edge/center off that slice.  Then use a
commutator to move them.  This approach requires a lot more thought
than Stefan&#x27;s method for each piece you solve, but it requires many
fewer moves.

Stefan and I have raced eachother with both approaches a number of
times and they are pretty much tied.  Both of our times were and are
very similar, so it really just depends on which approach you like
better.  Stefan&#x27;s method is all about faster recall and easier mental
visualization, where freestyle cycling as about pure efficiency, but
you expend a lot of thought power per piece trying to figure out how
to cycle it.

If you want more specifics then you can check out the BLD group.  Also
feel free to e-mail me or Stefan, I&#x27;m sure both of us could give you
tips for either method, though my knowledge of his method is fairly basic.

Which method are you interested in first?  Then you can decide how to
go from there.

Interesting -- analogous to memorizing orientations &quot;at a glance&quot;?

You said at some point that a random position is not &quot;meaningful&quot; 
information (or something similar) and that &quot;meaning&quot; increases as the 
cube is solved.
But you can easily imagine someone breaking up the pattern of 
orientations into blocks that they could solve independently of the 
rest, so that the &quot;random&quot; pattern of orientations would 
become &quot;meaningful&quot; in the context of their solution method.

The permutation is harder, though the cycles could be thought of as the 
meaningful content for anyone who solves along cycles.  You might 
imagine someone being able to memorize a cycle as soon as they had 
perceived it (maybe some can do this already?), but the rate limiting 
step would be &quot;seeing the cycle&quot; in the first place.

Sorry if someone has already said the same thing in this thread...

If someone could research which colors are the best, recognition would

It would depend on the method.  For most CFOP solvers, I would imagine they
would want the most distinct possible colors for each face separately, with
a possible exception for a pair of opposite faces  (to make opposite color
solving easier).

For Roux solving, it would probably work best to try for the maximum amount
of color distinction while still retaining some similarity between opposite
faces, because opposite colors are so important for the method.

It&#x27;s all down to method preference, really.

Yes, we do need an expert to help.

But, disregarding that, we could make a start by selecting colours that 
are entirely unlike all other colours.  For example, you would rule out 
purple, because we perceive it as both &quot;bluish&quot; and &quot;reddish&quot;.  Those 
fundamental colours that are unlike all others are usually called the 
psychological primaries (PPs).

For centuries, artists have agreed that the PPs are red, yellow, blue, 
and green.  Lay those 4 out on a circle with R opp G and Y opp B and 
you can fit all other colours into the gaps -- as you probably did in 
art classes at school.

[There is supposed to be a good physiological basis for the 4 PPs, too: 
it is /not/ based in the retina -- where there are only 3 kinds of 
colour receptor -- but in the way that colour information is 
transmitted from eye to brain.  My limited understanding of this is 
that there is a red/green channel (which transmits EITHER R OR G 
information, but not both) and a blue/yellow channel (similarly).]   

So that gives 4 colours that it should be hard to confuse in good 
light.  Perhaps the non-colours black/white could be used for the other 
2 faces, but (personally) I have found that black makes me feel vaguely 
uncomfortable -- it looks too &quot;empty&quot; on a cube.

          <div class="email-content">The black stickers work great on a white cube, though (in place of 
white stickers).  Speaking of which, anyone try the 2006 white cubes 
(with arched centers) yet?  Mine are due to arrive today.  I&#x27;ll have a 
full report later tonight.

For corners-first, I preferred the Japanese color scheme (blue 
opposite white) and I also liked flourescent orange.  Opposite color 
recognition did come into play more with that method.  For the last 
four edges it was easier to see orientation with those colors.  I&#x27;m 
not sure if this was just my preference or a real physiological 
factor.  With CFOP I use the standard color scheme and regular orange.

          <div class="email-content">I might also add here that you can figure out the cycles needed by 
examining the interplay of the letters of the first word in each 
visual set.  It would then just be a matter of how quickly you can 
translate two letters into two colors using the table.

Yes, of course you can interpret some meaning into a random cube. But 
like I said before, so can the chess masters with a random board. 
Still, for random boards they&#x27;re no better than weak players. Their 
memorization &quot;at a glance&quot; only works for really meaningful boards, i.
e. where they see patterns they know and understand.

You want to take a sequence of four colors and translate it to one 
word with four key consonants, right? Why not simply assign one 
consonant to each color (e.g. blue=B, green=G, white=W, red=R, 
orange=?, yellow=?) and then translate directly? Gets rid of the 
computation and the indirection through numbers...

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">That can work, but the problem is the limited number of letters 
used.  I was trying to find a way to introduce more letters of the 
alphabet. Like I recall reading about a memory hook somewhere where 
people might say &quot;Zazu zizo&quot; but of course it could be very easily 
confused with &quot;Zazi zuzo&quot; for instance.  Although the table 
seems &quot;complex&quot; at first, if you memorized it it would make 
conversions very fast.    

Read this:

http://www.slate.com/id/2114925/?GT1=6208

http://c1blog.blogspot.com/2005/03/memory-olympiads.html

A lot of extensive memory methods have seemingly complex bases, and 
by this I mean a memory set with multiple associations (one person 
in the above article has something associated with all numbers 0-
99).  The more you use the same memory hooks, the easier it is.  An 
extensive base allows for more unique and easily distuingishable 
associations.

          <div class="email-content">Some notes:

I used stefan&#x27;s method to solve the 4x4x4 blindfolded (am I the first?
:) ) and it&#x27;s very, very nice and easy to understand. You need to
visit some of the old posts in the BLD group to understand it, but
it&#x27;s really simple after that. Basically you have a buffer that swaps
between two places. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll get it :)

Oh, and Chris is going to Big-Up(tm) his way of moving blocks of
pieces at a time (which i&#x27;m trying at the moment), don&#x27;t delve in
until you understand the basics :)

The algs I use:

Parity: R&#x27; F&#x27; (l&#x27; U2) (l&#x27; U2) x (U2 l&#x27;) (U2 r) x&#x27; (U2 r&#x27;) (U2 l2) F R

Edges:

R U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;
(Rr) U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; R U R U&#x27; R&#x27;

Centres:

U r&#x27; u&#x27; r U&#x27; r&#x27; u r
r&#x27; u&#x27; r U r&#x27; u r U&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">I like to keep yellow and white (bright) on the L or R sides for my
two blocks, because since most of the time is in the first two blocks,
you want them standing out. Plus, they&#x27;re easily distinguished.

For my top layer/bottom layer, I have blue/green. This is because
these colours are the ones most similar to each other on the cube.
This is handy for:

Inverted blocks
Orientation of the LSE
Seeing multiple blocks as the same block

Thinking about the last one, I try and see green/blue as the same
colour, so that when I solve, I can start on a white or yellow block,
with either blue or green at the bottom, and it will not feel strange.
This allows me to start on any one of four blocks, then expand to a
further two different ones.

Of course, you need NMCMLL :)

Ever tryed solving on colours you&#x27;re not used to? baffling. Didn&#x27;t
used to be when i used petrus, but It felt &#x27;wrong&#x27;. Also, solving on
my cube with the weird colour scheme is odd, (orange is opposite white).

  Nowadays, finding out mate in 3 or 4 or even 5 is a childs play even when all the pieces are on the board. They know exactly what to look for and where to look  etc ? 
  If you know all the basic end games in chess, it is a cat&#x27;s walk!!

Oh my god.....<br>
<br>
Memorizing a deck of cards in 45 seconds is effectively memorizing <br>
two 4x4x4 edge permutations (with 4 pieces solved already, very <br>
likely) in 45 seconds.<br>
<br>
I take about 3:00 for one 4x4x4 edge permutation.<br>
<br>
Even with my centers, where I average about 17 pieces unsolved, I <br>
still take 1:30-2:00.<br>

Oh my god.........<br>

Blindfolded cubing is nowhere near it&#x27;s limits...  not even close by <br>

memorizing now....  Man, that is at once inspiring, and also kinda <br>

<br>
If I could memorize a 4x4x4 in 2:30 and solve in my usual 5:30-6:30 <br>
that would be amazing.  Wow..... so much to learn....<br>

This is about a digit per second.  Now, digits are all of the same 
nature.  The cube is a little kinder in the sense that it is already 
divided up into four elements which we solve (EO, EP, CP, CO).  
Taking the total number of pieces to memorize at the maximum (8 
corners to orient, 8 to permute, 12 edges to orient, 12 to permute), 
this is 40 pieces of data, a far cry from something as large as 
300.  Not only this, but 40 is assuming everything needs solving 
during execution (even then it would be easy to know that a 
Superflip would be needed to solve 12 bad edges, but let us assume 
that more pieces = harder to solve), AND these 40 pieces of data are 
already chunked into 4 different elements -- these advantages far 
outweigh the delays of turning the cube around to actually inspect 
the data.

Sorry for the typo, I meant BLD solve.

That&#x27;s cool...!  Yeah converting the cube into pieces of information 
in my head and backwards isn&#x27;t going very fast... I hope I can also 
do that instantaneously once :).

I found a yahoo group with people that like to memorise stuff :).

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/memorysports/messages

Maybe they can help us out a little.. :)

Maybe I&#x27;ll try to post a serious message there tomorrow morning.

<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m new to this group, I just joined today.  My name is Chris <br>
Hardwick and I&#x27;m posting here about a memory sport that has only <br>
been around since the invention of the Rubik&#x27;s cube, but in recent <br>
years has gained a lot of popularity.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m a competitive speedcuber, and a number of us speedcubers have <br>
also picked up the event of solving a Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded.  The <br>
procedure in an official competition works like this, you start the <br>
timer and begin memorizing your scrambled cube.  You then put on the <br>
blindfold and solve and at the end of the solve stop a timer.  The <br>
overall time is considered the time for your attempt and we rank <br>
each other for the fastest times.  The current world record for <br>
doing this is 1 minute 46.47 seconds.<br>
<br>
The top blindfolded solvers can memorize a 3x3x3 Rubik&#x27;s cube in <br>
around 40 seconds or less on a good run, and probably average 40-50 <br>
seconds given distractions or a sub-optimal solving environment.  <br>
Our unofficial record for fastest time to memorize a cube on a <br>
successful solve is 27 seconds.  We do not have an official record <br>
for this.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of discussion going on about how to improve <br>
blindfolded cubing.  We have alread developed a number of very <br>
efficient and sophisticated solving techniques, but memorization for <br>
most of us is not our strong point.<br>
<br>
After hearing that some people can memorize a deck of cards in <br>
around 45 seconds or less, I personally think that us speedcubers <br>
are not memorizing very well, and that much time can be dropped by <br>
using a good technique.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in reading about speedcubing, our main <br>
resource site is www.speedcubing.com and if you are interested in <br>
blindfolded cubing please check out our yahoo group at <br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/<br>
<br>
I personally have a theory that if either a blindfold cuber learned <br>
to truly train their memory, or if someone who had already mastered <br>
their memory learned one of our very efficient methods for solving a <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded, that greats things could be done in this <br>
developing competitive memory arena.<br>
<br>
Again blindfolded cubing has had most of its popularity in the last <br>
5 years or so, but already 30 people have officially solved a <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded in competition at least once in 2005 <br>
alone.  This is up from 9 in 2004.  So go easy on us!  We are an up <br>
and coming memory sport, and I would personally like to wish a warm <br>
welcome from the blindfolded cubing community to the memory sports <br>
community.  I have lots of questions to ask about memory training <br>
technqiues, and if anyone here is interested in this new area for <br>
showing off your memory I would be personally willing to show you a <br>
very efficient way to solve a cube blindfolded via e-mail <br>
coorespondence, or I can point you to a number of good online <br>
resources that show this too.<br>
<br>
I hope we can help each other out in some way, and if nothing else I <br>
feel I have so much to learn as far as my memory goes, and I would <br>
love this opportunity for a memory expert to help our blindfolded <br>
cubing community.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Chris<br>

I&#x27;ve noticed my Ultimate Skewb sitting on my shelf for a while.  I
tried using the mefferts solution a while ago, and it took me a while
to get the hang of it.  When I get back from my trip this weekend,
maybe I&#x27;ll look into it more for speedsolving.  Let us know (or email
me personally if no one else wants to hear about it,
cparlett@...) if you develop some algorithms and methods.

The answer is just awesome. Moreover he says that some people have
already tried to memorize cubes :-)

This is going to be very interesting.

   In my opinion, with a good memory technique and a good cube sighting , 3*3*3 can be memorised in 20 sec and 4*4*4 in 112 sec and 5*5*5 in 184 sec.
  A piece can be memorised in a sec in 3*3*3 but in 2 sec in 4*4*4 and 5*5*5 respectively. And of course the cuber should be as enthusiastic as you and as young(old)as you. 
  I am 46. I can not memorise as fast as you, although I know some memory techniques.(Carl Lewis can not run 100 mt race in sub 10 sec anymore although he knows all the tricks and trade of running 100 mt). As you are getting older speed cuts down but not recalling.
  How to use the phonetic sound and its value system to memorise 3*3*3 plz visit www.freewebs.com/bernett.

Aren&#x27;t you gonna try megaminx blindfolded again?? I can see that, if
it will take you some 5 hours, you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the effort,
but it would be cool if you could lower the record with a few hours :-)

How hard was it to do compared with, say 5*5*5?? Did you go slow
during the solve to be sure you didn&#x27;t mess up anything?

<br>
Alright, well, this is my primary solving method for 5x5 now, and I <br>
got a time that was 1 second off my PB this morning.  My times have <br>
been dropping steadily as I get more used to the method, and I think <br>
I will break my PB during my spare...This is looking to be a good <br>
method in the end...<br>
<br>
Craig<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lately I&#x27;ve been solving the bigger cubes (biggest so far is <br>
10x10) I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started on thursday I think with 7x7, then friday 8x8, saturday <br>
9x9,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and sunday 10x10 (I did a 6x6 too)  And I am trying to find the <br>
most<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; efficient way of doing these, and I think it can apply to 5x5 <br>
as well.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, here goes...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1: Solve all Centers<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2: using the (Ll) F&#x27; L F (Ll)&#x27; Solve the white edges and put <br>
them in<br>
&gt; &gt; place<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3: Put in first layer (white) corners<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4: Solve the &quot;middle&quot; edges (like the cage) so it solves them<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; directly, and you won&#x27;t have to solve as 3x3 at the end.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5: Solve LL corners<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6: Solve LL edges (using 3 cycles, or commutators or whatever <br>
you<br>
&gt; want)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I woke up this morning and this was <br>
the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first thing that came to my mind.  It solves all the pieces <br>
directly,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so you don&#x27;t have to do anything extra at the end.  I&#x27;ll try it <br>
today<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometime hopefully.<br>

Yes, one day I want to solve megaminx blindfolded again, and much 
faster. I have better ideas for execution now, but I&#x27;m too lazy to 
practice memorization techniques. I want to become better at that 
before I try some larger blindsolving things again.

I stepped right from 3x3 to megaminx, no 4x4 or 5x5 in between. The 
megaminx was my first real heavy usage of a memorization technique. 
That&#x27;s why it took so long. Also, it&#x27;s harder to setup pieces. I can&#x27;t 
say what&#x27;s harder, 5x5 or megaminx, one is easier this way, the other 
is easier that way.

Hey Chris, you&#x27;re funny :-). Did you really not know about these 
techniques and records until now? I somewhat thought it&#x27;s common 
knowledge at least among the blindcubers now. Btw, why did you ask 
that memorizer about memorizing the cube through numbers again? It&#x27;s 
so obvious he&#x27;ll tell you to *not* use numbers.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I got the answer from an expert :-)
You&#x27;ll find below the email I wrote to Rochester&#x27;s Laboratory 
dedicated to color science, they have a webpage where one can ask 
color scientists about color perception among many other subjects:
http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/outreach/categories.php

So here is a scientific optimal color scheme, let start peeling our 
orange stickers ;-)

&quot;Thanks for your inquiry.

Generally research on color contrast involves only two colors (such
as text on a background), so this is definitely an interesting
question.  You have already identified black and white and they
should certainly be included in your set of six.  The next step would
be to include 4 chromatic colors that are of intermediate lightness
(i.e., not very dark or very light so that they are not easily
confused with the white or black).  While it is difficult to say what
the optimum choices would be, there is probably very little to gain
in performance once the colors are separated into distinct hue
categories that would not be confused.  For example, choosing yellow,
green, blue, and red would be about as good as you can do.  You just
want to make sure that the blue and green are clearly distinguishable
which might be accomplished best by making the blue slightly purplish.

I hope this helps.

-Mark&quot;


... and here was the question I sent to them:

Hi,
I am a member of an internet forum dedicated to the Rubik&#x27;s cube (I am 
quite sure you remember this puzzle !), and more precisely to 
speedsolving this puzzle. As you may remember, there are 6 different 
colors (white, yellow, dark red, orange, dark blue, and dark green), 
one for each cube face in the solved state. Each face is divided into 
9 squares. Some people are able to solve the cube under 20 secondes on 
average, using a 7-step method. Steps 2-7 involve &quot;instant&quot; 
recognition of a case (1 out of ~50 for step 6, one out of ~20 for 
step 7 for example) and the execution of the memorized corresponding 
moves sequence.
The question is, do you have an idea about the &quot;ideal&quot; color scheme 
that one should use for optimizing the color discrimination ability, 
hence decreasing the decision time ? This can be reworded as &quot;what is 
the set of 6 colors (including black/white) that human eye is the best 
(=faster?) to be able to discriminate ?&quot;. I would be very happy if you 
have any idea or references about this topic !
Thank you very much for your answer

Cyril

          <div class="email-content">Wow, so use the standard scheme, but replace orange with black?  
What if you use flourescent orange?  I would think that provides 
enough of a different contrast from dark red.

He talks about making blue and green clearly distinguishable. He&#x27;s
right. Sometimes, when both are a bit dark, it&#x27;s not easy. That&#x27;s why
I have bright (fluo) green and dark blue.
My other dark color is red. Even if blue and red are very dark, you
can make the difference because of the hue. And it makes orange very
distinct from red.

Brightness is a decisive component, and it depends on the color. I
used to cube with 2 blue sides, one very bright, one very dark. It was
not bad at all!

Ask your expert for the best set of 6 HSV vectors!

I&#x27;ve been speed solving the cube for several years now.  I&#x27;ve been 
sub 60 for over a year now, since the start of my Junior year (2004-
2005)

Back then I used a LBL method and picked up on PLL.  F2L was the way 
to go though.

January 16, 2006 I started Fridrich F2L from Hardwick&#x27;s site
It took me two weeks to get all the f2l cases memorized.  I was 
struggling still at first.  It is now March 3  So I&#x27;ve been using F2L 
for about 5 weeks.  My PB is 27.42 seconds w/ Fridrich
I&#x27;m learning COLL and redoing my Edge PLLs

What is so bad about it?  Presumably the authors wanted to present a 
simple solution method that could be learnt relatively easily.  Their 
leaflet does that job.

Would it be appropriate for Rubik&#x27;s Cube to be boxed with a hefty 
manual describing the Fridrich method -- and nothing simpler?

          <div class="email-content">Take a video of yourself and look for any hesitations.  Work on that 
area.  It&#x27;s likely the F2L.  I took a video of a dozen or so of my own 
solves and watched it, and the hesitation was between each F2L pair.  
So that&#x27;s my current focus.

You can also just time each step (C, F, O, P) separately and see if 
one needs work.

Finally, counting moves (while solving slowly) is useful to ensure you 
are using an efficient set of algorithms.

          <div class="email-content">ok since credits is apparently becoming an important thing, i will
mention it outloud since i don&#x27;t have the time to complete the page
for it now.  this site is pretty much frank morris.com.  he gave me
all the instructions, and methods, and proofread did just about
everything but the coding.  however some of the last 2 edge algorithms
for the professor were found independently by many other people i&#x27;m
sure.  thanks and appreciation goes to all the great bigcubers who&#x27;s
work made the page possible like ron, chris h who also helped with the
proofreading of the 4x4 part, frederick badie, and i&#x27;m sure many
others who&#x27;s work contributed.  if you use the page a lot and think is
great, please let frank know because he really let it all out for the
site, and appreciation is always great. :)  hopefully i will made some
great additions and upgrades soon, if i ever have the time, and thanks
to all 3,392 unique users who have used the site so far.

That&#x27;s what I do. I haven&#x27;t completed a full solve yet so who cares.  <br>

The orientations lend themselves quite nicely to immediate  <br>
visualization. Permutations no doubt require more work and  <br>
experience, since you can&#x27;t just look at one piece in isolation and  <br>
know what to do with it, you&#x27;re memorizing relations between pieces.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Ryan,

That is very good important question! I while ago, I have been 
trying to memorise the corners of the cube visually, and that seemed 
to work fine... I always thought that making up big stories and 
images in your head was something for people that can&#x27;t memorise 
very well. :). But now I found out that people that memorise a deck 
of cards in under a minute also use techniques like this, and it 
doesn&#x27;t have to mean you are wasting time at all...

So how can that work? Why is it interesting to transform the 
information into a story with things that don&#x27;t have anything to do 
with cubing?

Well, as for the method I am trying to learn now, (person, action 
and object method): when you are memorising, you are memorising 
things that the human brain is used to. All your life, you have been 
storing memories with people that you know well, that are doing 
things. That&#x27;s just what your brain can automatically do. Storing 
images of people doing things in you head is more &#x27;natural&#x27; ;) for 
the brain to deal with than a bunch of positions on a cube. That&#x27;s 
why I think it will be feasable to use this system. (John Louis, am 
I right?).

          <div class="email-content">You are perfectly correct Joel, in my opinion. I like to clarify one more point here. 
  First of all, it is only a beginning. To focus your attention in the initial period of learning to memorise a cube you are transforming the information. With more practice, slowly you will be able to focus your attention when you are memorising without transforming the information. Only experience will tell you that. 
  I think some of you like Leyan, Tyson, Macky, David Orser, Jean Pons and Chris Hardwick are all able to focus their attention and able to memorise without transforming and more importantly able to retain those ABSTRACT, INTANGIBLE information until they complete solving the cube. If you have already reached that stage, that is good. Still I strongly believe, once you master the P/A/O technique, it will be faster than the rote memorising.
   
  Secondly, By applying P/A/O method combined with a journey, you can memorise any number of cubes and solve them blindfolded. I don&#x27;t think it is possible by rote memory or atleast P/A/O method will be faster than rote memory. 
  Has anyone using rote memory to memorise the cube, tried multi-cubes blindfolded except David Orser ? I don&#x27;t know which memorisation technique David used for his 10 cubes BLD.

You are perfectly correct Joel, in my opinion. I like to clarify one more point here. 
  First of all, it is only a beginning. To focus your attention in the initial period of learning to memorise a cube you are transforming the information. With more practice, slowly you will be able to focus your attention when you are memorising without transforming the information. Only experience will tell you that. 
  I think some of you like Leyan, Tyson, Macky, David Orser, Jean Pons and Chris Hardwick are all able to focus their attention and able to memorise without transforming and more importantly able to retain those ABSTRACT, INTANGIBLE information until they complete solving the cube. If you have already reached that stage, that is good. Still I strongly believe, once you master the P/A/O technique, it will be faster than the rote memorising.
   
  Secondly, By applying P/A/O method combined with a journey, you can memorise any number of cubes and solve them blindfolded. I don&#x27;t think it is possible by rote memory or atleast P/A/O method will be faster than rote memory. 
  Has anyone using rote memory to memorise the cube, tried multi-cubes blindfolded except David Orser ? I don&#x27;t know which memorisation technique David used for his 10 cubes BLD.

  Hello Ryan,

That is very good important question! I while ago, I have been 
trying to memorise the corners of the cube visually, and that seemed 
to work fine... I always thought that making up big stories and 
images in your head was something for people that can&#x27;t memorise 
very well. :). But now I found out that people that memorise a deck 
of cards in under a minute also use techniques like this, and it 
doesn&#x27;t have to mean you are wasting time at all...

So how can that work? Why is it interesting to transform the 
information into a story with things that don&#x27;t have anything to do 
with cubing?

Well, as for the method I am trying to learn now, (person, action 
and object method): when you are memorising, you are memorising 
things that the human brain is used to. All your life, you have been 
storing memories with people that you know well, that are doing 
things. That&#x27;s just what your brain can automatically do. Storing 
images of people doing things in you head is more &#x27;natural&#x27; ;) for 
the brain to deal with than a bunch of positions on a cube. That&#x27;s 
why I think it will be feasable to use this system. (John Louis, am 
I right?).

You are perfectly correct Joel, in my opinion. I like to clarify one more point here. 
  First of all, it is only a beginning. To focus your attention in the initial period of learning to memorise a cube you are transforming the information. With more practice, slowly you will be able to focus your attention when you are memorising without transforming the information. Only experience will tell you that. 
  I think some of you like Leyan, Tyson, Macky, David Orser, Jean Pons and Chris Hardwick are all able to focus their attention and able to memorise without transforming and more importantly able to retain those ABSTRACT, INTANGIBLE information until they complete solving the cube. If you have already reached that stage, that is good. Still I strongly believe, once you master the P/A/O technique, it will be faster than the rote memorising.
   
  Secondly, By applying P/A/O method combined with a journey, you can memorise any number of cubes and solve them blindfolded. I don&#x27;t think it is possible by rote memory or atleast P/A/O method will be faster than rote memory. 
  Has anyone using rote memory to memorise the cube, tried multi-cubes blindfolded except David Orser ? I don&#x27;t know which memorisation technique David used for his 10 cubes BLD.

  Hello Ryan,

That is very good important question! I while ago, I have been 
trying to memorise the corners of the cube visually, and that seemed 
to work fine... I always thought that making up big stories and 
images in your head was something for people that can&#x27;t memorise 
very well. :). But now I found out that people that memorise a deck 
of cards in under a minute also use techniques like this, and it 
doesn&#x27;t have to mean you are wasting time at all...

So how can that work? Why is it interesting to transform the 
information into a story with things that don&#x27;t have anything to do 
with cubing?

Well, as for the method I am trying to learn now, (person, action 
and object method): when you are memorising, you are memorising 
things that the human brain is used to. All your life, you have been 
storing memories with people that you know well, that are doing 
things. That&#x27;s just what your brain can automatically do. Storing 
images of people doing things in you head is more &#x27;natural&#x27; ;) for 
the brain to deal with than a bunch of positions on a cube. That&#x27;s 
why I think it will be feasable to use this system. (John Louis, am 
I right?).

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ryan,

I think doing something like this is alright for the 3x3x3, you can 
still get some really fast times, but I would hate the idea of also 
using it for the 5x5x5.  Storing all that information by rote for 
the 5x5x5 would take me twice as long as using the stories I use, 
and the stories I use aren&#x27;t even as good as P/A/O so it could be 
even faster with a better method than what I use.

Also, after learning more about the journey method and 
person/action/object, I think it would be considerably faster to use 
this method for a 3x3x3 rather than the current rote memorization 
techniques.  I&#x27;ve already laid out my journey with 24 positions (I 
want to use it for 4x4 and 5x5 centers) and I&#x27;m working on the 
framework for the actual persons/actions/and objects right now.

I plan on switching my memorization for all cubes to the P/A/O 
method, especially after seeing how fast the masters of this method 
can memorize things.

Also, John Louis is a 4 level method P/A/O/O or person action object 
object?  The reason I ask, one of the memorisers at the US 
competition describe one of his images as &quot;Frank Sinatra 
Croons &quot;Baby one more Time&quot; to an Obelisk&quot; and this appears to me to 
be P/A/O/O.  Since the cube orbits only have 24 pieces it seems that 
a 4 level system or even a 5 level system 
(person/adverb/action/adjective/object, for example Bob Artistically 
Destroys the Red Car)

Since the cube orbits are only 24 pieces instead of 52, why don&#x27;t we 
make a more complicated system that fits our needs?  With a 5 level 
system you could memorize the edge permutation of a 4x4 or 5x5 in at 
best 3 images.  That would be awesome!

Nice that you are also trying to create words and images for a P/A/O 
method...

I now finished a list with 22 * 3 words (22 names, 22 actions and 22 
objects)!!! I am so happy with this.. I really spend a lot of time 
on it, because I wanted to have actions and objects that I can 
really make a visual image about.. And the list I have now works for 
that! I am going to train myself converting the cube into the images 
and backwards the next few days... I will let you know how I am 
doing.

          <div class="email-content">Yes Rune. I have not forgotten Stefan Poachmann. He is one of the greats.He is the pioneer of P/A/O method. I did not mention his name just because he is already using the system and very often explaining it to others. He is not using rote memory. That is why he(only one) solved Megaminx blindfolded, FOUR  3*3*3 cubes BLD. I don&#x27;t think it is possible with rote memory.
  I am sorry, if it hurts you.

Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] Re: Natural memorisation


You are perfectly correct Joel, in my opinion. I like to clarify one more point here. 
  First of all, it is only a beginning. To focus your attention in the initial period of learning to memorise a cube you are transforming the information. With more practice, slowly you will be able to focus your attention when you are memorising without transforming the information. Only experience will tell you that. 
  I think some of you like Leyan, Tyson, Macky, David Orser, Jean Pons and Chris Hardwick are all able to focus their attention and able to memorise without transforming and more importantly able to retain those ABSTRACT, INTANGIBLE information until they complete solving the cube. If you have already reached that stage, that is good. Still I strongly believe, once you master the P/A/O technique, it will be faster than the rote memorising.
   
  Secondly, By applying P/A/O method combined with a journey, you can memorise any number of cubes and solve them blindfolded. I don&#x27;t think it is possible by rote memory or atleast P/A/O method will be faster than rote memory. 
  Has anyone using rote memory to memorise the cube, tried multi-cubes blindfolded except David Orser ? I don&#x27;t know which memorisation technique David used for his 10 cubes BLD.

  Hello Ryan,

That is very good important question! I while ago, I have been 
trying to memorise the corners of the cube visually, and that seemed 
to work fine... I always thought that making up big stories and 
images in your head was something for people that can&#x27;t memorise 
very well. :). But now I found out that people that memorise a deck 
of cards in under a minute also use techniques like this, and it 
doesn&#x27;t have to mean you are wasting time at all...

So how can that work? Why is it interesting to transform the 
information into a story with things that don&#x27;t have anything to do 
with cubing?

Well, as for the method I am trying to learn now, (person, action 
and object method): when you are memorising, you are memorising 
things that the human brain is used to. All your life, you have been 
storing memories with people that you know well, that are doing 
things. That&#x27;s just what your brain can automatically do. Storing 
images of people doing things in you head is more &#x27;natural&#x27; ;) for 
the brain to deal with than a bunch of positions on a cube. That&#x27;s 
why I think it will be feasable to use this system. (John Louis, am 
I right?).

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joël,

I hope your words are going well!  I have been thinking about mine for
a while and finally finished today.  I just used A-X because I want to
be able to know which number I am at when I stop (I plan to use this
for the 4x4 and 5x5 edges).  Also I think I will use only the A-L for
the 3x3 edges and M-T for the 3x3 corners.  Or at least I&#x27;ll try it
and see how it works.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll use for the bigger cubes
for the corners, probably the same I am using now I guess.  Still
unsure how to add all these together for a new approach to memorizing
the 5x5x5 BLD.

I haven&#x27;t memorized my words yet, I just finished creating them.  Now
it&#x27;s off to memorizing them and placing them onto my 4x4 edges in a
way that I like.

Hope your solving with your system goes well, keep us updated!  I will
try to do them same.

Happy cubing!
Chris

Oh I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible. It would just be much harder (at least for

&gt; Hey Ryan,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think doing something like this is alright for the 3x3x3, you can <br>
&gt; still get some really fast times, but I would hate the idea of also <br>
&gt; using it for the 5x5x5.  Storing all that information by rote for <br>
&gt; the 5x5x5 would take me twice as long as using the stories I use, <br>
<br>
To be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating &quot;rote memorisation&quot; either. That means<br>
memorising something using a process of repetition, without necessarily<br>
comprehending what is being memorised. This is also unappealing to me.<br>
<br>
What I am talking about is memorisation by analysis of the material in<br>
its native domain.<br>
<br>
With the amount of brain mass that is dedicated to visual processing, it<br>
is hard to believe that there isn&#x27;t enough of it to break down the<br>
structure of a cube visually.<br>
<br>
Much less of our brain is dedicated to auditory processing, yet in one<br>
second, a human brain can identify and memorise the equivalent of more<br>
than half the information content of 1 cube, within an audio signal.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey <br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t jump so quickly to an internet site! The beauty of these puzzles <br>
is in working them out yourself! I assume you can do the 3x3 right... <br>
so, see how many of those principles apply for the 5x5. If you can do <br>
the 4x4, even better, since the 5x5 is actually easier (if one regards <br>
the fixed centers as making the puzzle easier).<br>
<br>
Rather than jumping into a complete solution with &#x27;pretty java cube <br>
applets&#x27;, here are some hints:<br>
<br>
1) Find out the most &#x27;difficult&#x27; part of the solution, and do it first:<br>
if you think about this, you should see that the centers are most <br>
easily done first, and, lucky for you :) this is VERY intuitive.<br>
<br>
After solving the centers, you naturally ask yourself, &#x27;what is the <br>
next most taxing/difficult&#x27; step. Surely it isn&#x27;t the corners (which <br>
behave as those on the 3x3), so you are left with the &#x27;edge cubies&#x27;. <br>
<br>
-What would be the most LOGICAL next step? IF you&#x27;ve thought about it, <br>
you&#x27;ll see that if you can associate every three edge cubies into a <br>
single &#x27;edge triplet&#x27;, your cube will do something intriguing... It <br>
will behave as a 3x3! You have reduced the problem of solving the 5x5 <br>
to that of solving the 3x3! This is the method I&#x27;d recommend, as it <br>
works for all cubes n&gt;3. In fact, for odd cubes there is only ONE <br>
important algorithm you need to workout (in addition to those on the <br>
3x3), namely one which &#x27;flips&#x27; (swaps) two edge cubies. I&#x27;d suggest <br>
you work this one out, since doing so will SHOW you why the position <br>
occurs, which is quite fascinating!<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck!<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

So far, I am doing well.. I didn&#x27;t memorise a cube with my system 
yet, but I am getting used to the persons and other words... I do 
that with a cube in my hands, so I can think of a person (as an 
image in my head) immediately when I see a piece. 

I really try to push my imagination to work here... I really feel 
that using your imagination to create the images in my head will 
help here... To illustrate this, after I woke up, and was freshing 
up in front of the mirror, and I told myself three little &#x27;stories&#x27; 
in my system (also using the &#x27;journey&#x27; around the house I am 
planning to use), just to think of a few examples of scenes that 
could occur with my system... I wasn&#x27;t planning on recalling it, but 
5 minutes later, on the dinner table, I was perfectly able to recall 
the 3 scenes (would be 9 pieces of information) without a problem. I 
really had the feeling I was recalling stuff... And it worked.

Today, I will try to get used to the system more, and also try to 
use it to solve a few cubes blindfolded...

One thing I am realising now, is that if anyone wants to learn to 
solve a cube blindfolded fast, he&#x27;s also getting into a new hobby: 
memorising. It&#x27;s like a new sport! I got interested by people who 
use the phonetic system to read numbers as if they are sounds to 
remember numbers easily... I am also interested in learning that 
too :).

Well g2g now.. Good luck Chris!!

- Joël.

It&#x27;s a shocked, surprised &quot;WHAT?!?&quot; that I said to myself when I saw 
my result (I only write down my times during the average and let my 
computer do the stats *afterwards*). Btw, I&#x27;m actually more shocked 
about the 17.61 avg100 than the 15.77 avg10...

Cheers!

I&#x27;ve also wondered... sent him an email a week or two ago when I 
noticed he hadn&#x27;t posted for a month. But no reply yet. If anyone is 
in contact with him, please just make him say &#x27;hi&#x27; or whatever... he&#x27;s 
making me worried a bit...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Anssi,

Those competitions were both unofficial. The Stackmat timer was first used 
during WC2003.

Here are some parts of a report on the French championship 2003:

&quot;
The organizers were &quot;Winning moves&quot;, they are the only ones to sell Rubik&#x27;s
cubes in France. Their goal was not to organize an OFFICIAL championship, 
but it was to
reveal come talented cubists, and send the best of them to Toronto.
&quot;

&quot;
The first five cubists in this championships were from the french group
(!!!!) (Nicolas/ J-B / Thomas Templier / Frederic Badie (and me)).
J-B was the last of us with an average time of 58 seconds, all the other
cubists (about 15) were above the minute, and AMAZED when they saw the first
30-40 seconds time.
&quot;

See attachment for a picture of the group.
Adam Géhin won with a best time of 15 seconds.
The times were measured with a stopwatch.

I posted a short item on the Korean championship 2003, including the results 
and a video.
Check out http://www.speedcubing.com/events/unofficial

Have fun,

Ron

Is it so that you don&#x27;t get nervous if you have a great rolling
average coming? I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not even close to as nervous
when I write down the times, as when I put them into JNetCube after
each solve and am able to see my session average.

No, that&#x27;s not the intention. I just prefer to store all times in text 
files and then run a program that I wrote to do the stats. This lets 
me keep all data and if I improve the program I just delete the stats 
files and run it again and it will compute the improved stats for all 
data again. I also like to include some comments sometimes and now I 
always include the scramble as well. For example I take the Sunday 
Contest scrambles and copy them into an editor:

R U D&#x27; ... L F&#x27; L2
D U&#x27; F ... B R2 F
R2 F R&#x27; ... L F2 U&#x27;

Then I solve and add the times and comments if I want to, e.g.:

=16.97 R U D&#x27; ... L F&#x27; L2
=12.34 D U&#x27; F ... B R2 F (PLL=U&#x27;)
=23.45 R2 F R&#x27; ... L F2 U&#x27; (I suck)

Cheers!

5b5)	If after the solve a non functional part of the puzzle is 
still defect (like a center cap of a cube) or not fully rotated (like 
a 5x5x5 center piece twisted in its spot), but the puzzle is otherwise 
unambiguously solved, the puzzle is considered solved, under 
discretion of the main judge.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Okay so I&#x27;m going to answer my own question:

WCA Article 5b5: &quot;If after the solve a non functional part of the

So I guess it&#x27;s not a big deal, and I don&#x27;t have to glue the caps.

I think we see some of the same in the cubing community. Those who 
like the magic are also keen on cupstacking. Both are about 
dexterity :-)

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">With arched centers, the track in which each face rotates is perfectly 
circular.  With flat centers, the track is more octagonal.

The octagonal tracks have less friction but the tension is somewhat 
uneven, and the edge pieces can &quot;pop&quot; out of the cube during 
speedsolving.

The arched centers tend to hold the pieces in better, but will also 
catch more often if adjacent faces are not well-aligned.

It totally depends on your cubing style.  I never used to pop with 
flat centers, so I preferred them.  Now I&#x27;ve changed my style and I 
pop them all the time, so I switched to arched centers and I never 
pop.  Once you improve your turning accuracy, the arched centers are 
generally the preferred cube to use.

One other note is that the arched centers are somewhat quieter.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, well...

I averaged about low 30s with the following method:

Cross, insert FL corners, not caring about orientation, and either
learn the 11 or w/e algs for F2L with corner inserted...then:

17 basic LL algs for 4LLL(everytime) (some on the next page too)
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/24999

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/25002

With practice this can become fast, and then you can just get
intuitive for the last of F2L and eliminate a few of the steps.  I now
average around 24 seconds and I know all except 4 PLLs and a handful
of OLLs, and full F2L...its all what you want to take the time to learn...

P.S. - I started doing BLD yesterday, and I&#x27;ve come SOOOOO close SOOOO
many times...Stefan: YOU ROCK!!! Ur method is soooo easy :)

P.S.  I will help scramble as necessary, even for big cubes.
P.P.S.  If you would be willing to house me, I would be much more inclined
to make it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi
1. learn the language. It&#x27;s not that hard.
2. if you insist: use my favelet, that&#x27;s even easier
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/favelet/index.htm
Then you won&#x27;t be bothered with algorithm junk
3. Or, use my applet page if you&#x27;r handier with urls
http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp
e.g. http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=(ME)4

good luck

This is exactly the method I currently use... Do you have problems 
with permuting the corners, or just permuting the edges without 
destroying other things (like corner orientation)?

Well.. I guess we should meet on MSN.

          <div class="email-content">Not if the lessons were separated by a day or two.  I learned very 
quickly with only a crude set of notes as my only hints, and could 
solve in 3 minutes in almost no time.  Granted, I had plenty of time 
as a schoolkid on summer vacation.

Plus, he had Tyson as a teacher... that&#x27;s kinda like having a top 
trainer, isn&#x27;t it?

          <div class="email-content">I recall some interviews where he said he was indeed accepted 
(offered a scholarship), but turned it down to pursue acting.  He&#x27;s 
always liked math/science-related things.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 
unrealistic to learn how to solve the cube in a day&#x27;s tutoring.

you think that&#x27;s a fair comparsion? a geek and a
rapper.
If Will taught you how to rap or dance, do you think
you learn it as fast as another rapper/dancer like
Usher?

A) Toby taught Will, not Tyson

B) Will got accepted to MIT, so hes not stupid...

C) Why are you calling Chris a geek??? do you know him??? Not many
cubers are full on geeks, except of course Tyson (at least thats what
the officials say) But i don&#x27;t think he is...

Read posts, before posting, and don&#x27;t call ppl names...

          <div class="email-content">Say whatever you want, but I know that Will Smith could solve the cube 
in 2 minutes flat while talking trash about you.  He certainly did that 
while beating down the arrogant extras who thought they were hot stuff.

Some people are just naturally talented at things.  Some people pick up 
things better than others.  Some people struggle very hard at certain 
things.  It&#x27;s how the world works.

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s how I remember it.<br>
<br>
Toby and I taught him on day 1. On the second day, Toby couldn&#x27;t make  <br>
it, so it was only me. Both days for an hour or so. At the end he  <br>
could solve the whole cube, with help of some notes.<br>
<br>
I never made it back after that, but I think I heard that a while  <br>
later he needed a little final refresher on the last layer. And after  <br>
that he was rock solid. I presume because he practiced by himself.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve taught a lot of people to cube, and very few learn faster than  <br>
Will. And if you think about it, the job of an actor is in large part  <br>
to memorize a lot of dialog and other skills, so it&#x27;s not all that  <br>
unexpected that he&#x27;d be good at it..<br>

cubes from Restoration Hardware.  (I had never taken it apart because <br>
it turned so smoothly out of the box).  As I suspected, they use the <br>
same parts that are included in the new 2006 DIY kits (but presumably <br>
with rivets, not screws).  Basically this means they have the new <br>
corner caps (with gap) which results in even turning on all three <br>
internal faces of each corner.  I&#x27;ve seen at least one M1005B cube in <br>
Hasbro packaging as well, so the new parts are beginning to make their <br>
way into retail.  I applaud Seven Towns for their continuous <br>
improvement of the cube mechanism these past couple years.<br>

Just out of curiosity - wouldn&#x27;t Erno Rubik be the most influential cuber? After all if he 
hadn&#x27;t cubed arguably nobody else on this group would have.

made out of wood.

only reason i know it is because i did a research project on it two years ago.

but... he never was a speedcuber...:-/

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

If the question is the most influential cuber i would vote Stefan 
Pochmann. Because he is into so many different puzzles and he is so 
good at them. And he has contributed lots with new methods and so 
on. If it&#x27;s more a matter of the most influential person in the 
cubing community i would vote for Ron. All his dedicated work. If it 
weren&#x27;t for him we would never hav gotten this far. Lots of 
competitions and so on :-)

About Macky. What is his contributions apart from being able to 
solve fast? Not much that i know ... But of course he is an amazing 
cuber. Im not gonna take that away ... :-)

Have fun guys!

the first to organize a competition after 2003, and I would say that
Caltech Winter 2004 set the standard for all local competitions as we
know today. Without someone like him, we may have had to wait till
2009 for the next competition!

I can say with confidence that I would have been _nothing_ without his
tremendous efforts in organizing the Caltech competitions.

  Hi Erik,

  This is exactly the method I currently use... Do you have problems 
  with permuting the corners, or just permuting the edges without 
  destroying other things (like corner orientation)?

  Well.. I guess we should meet on MSN.

actually built a 2x2x2 prototype first.  So apparently that one was

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The record would be pretty much the same. People would use another 
fast method. Im in no doubt that other methods can be just as fast :D

The good thing about the Fridrich method is that it can be learnt in 
steps. Increasing complexity. Increasing number of algorithms. And 
from Fridrich u can extend it to even more complex methods. So 
there&#x27;s no wonder it&#x27;s such a popular method ;-)

Have fun!

&gt;<br>
<br>
firstly let me state i am not a cuber unfortunately due to my <br>
physical disability i was never able to get on with the standard cube<br>
<br>
i am however completing a degree in software engineering and thought <br>
that this would be an interesting problem to look at for my final <br>
project.<br>
<br>
the main problem i have with many of the simulations i&#x27;ve found for <br>
comparison centres around the middle row and orientation issues<br>
<br>
many of the simulations found including some examples in the files <br>
section of the croup allow the middle rows of the 3x3x3 cube to move <br>
independently like the outer rows. These moves would seem to be <br>
physically impssible on an actual cube. the only way you could <br>
simulate a move on the middle rows is to rotate the two outer faces <br>
and alter the orientation of the cube. implying that each middle row <br>
move would actually have to be counted as two moves rather than one. <br>
and would only be correct at all if the cube was viewed from one <br>
fixed position.<br>
<br>
the fact that in many cases in these simulations you can perform a <br>
move on the centre lines and aulter the orientation view of the cube <br>
would seem from a new user perspective to be incorrect<br>
<br>
am i thinking along the right lines, can tou think of some other <br>
reason for implementing this functionality<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I merely counted the votes to decide the top 5 finalists for the 
poll.  This poll is more for fun than anything else.  I will 
eventually release the comments that were included in all nominations 
and honorable mentions.  These comments will of course be on an 
anoymous basis.

There are a few ways to look at this phrase: &quot;most influential 
cuber&quot;. Indeed there are those who have contributed great things to 
the community!  On the other hand, a relatively unknown cuber can be 
an influence on a more direct and personal basis.  

This is an amazing idea, that we do not need to be the world&#x27;s best 
to touch the life of another cuber and inspire excellence within him 
or her. We all have this grand ability within us to influence 
others;  just remember that and smile :)  

Jindagi acchi hai!

I did not receive an email from you voting for someone, but you care 
enough to post challenging a relatively harmless poll?  Perhaps the 
most influential cuber in your eyes -- is you :P  

Surely this effort can be used for more productive things.

i can see that... but as the cube has a fixed centre you are still 
effectivly rotating the two sides and orienting the cube.

the method you discribed may be fast but you are still effectivly 
performing two moves at once... two face rotations and an orientation

the fact that you are holding the two side faces. fixes the orientation 
angle to one location

im sorry if im babbling but this is a interesting point.

The most influential cuber? Long ago I taught a girl to assamble the cube. In Her eyes *I* am the most influential cuber in the world.

If &quot;the most influential cuber&quot; is chosen after such argumentations, the poll is not only &quot;harmless&quot; but even funny and as such, has the right to be laughed at).

You have just conceded that this poll is indeed harmless.  Very 
good!  Then why the fixation on it?  As far as the laughter goes; 
your antics alone provide comic relief you sly dog!

Richard had asked here about 2 months ago to send him emails voting 
for your top 1-2 cubers, *that* poll was meant, not the current one 
which is a result from the first.

Maybe that&#x27;s what *you* are effectively doing, but certainly Mike and 
I (and many others) are really doing the middle slice turn, nothing 
else.

Btw, if you don&#x27;t like that in the simulations, maybe don&#x27;t use it?

<br>
Right, Rubik&#x27;s cube allows for simultaneous movements along parallel<br>
planes. On a 20x20x20 cube, we could theoretically perform 19 movements<br>
simultaneously (if we had enough hands/fingers) since there are 19<br>
parallel &quot;cut planes&quot; along any axis. 19 simultaneous movements could<br>
be performed in the same time as 1 simple move, but would also require<br>
exerting 19 times more force.<br>
<br>
We do not normally think of a cube rotation (orientation as you call it)<br>
as a move. One explanation is that it involves zero cut planes. The move<br>
you describe can be described as two simultaneous movements without any<br>
need for a cube rotation, i.e. r&#x27; for the first cut plane, and R for the<br>
second cut plane, performed simultaneously.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#x27;t say that methods involving such movements are &quot;incorrectly<br>
modelled&quot;, however. It is very practical in the description of those<br>
methods to describe such movements as single moves rather than two<br>
simultaneous moves. Edges last methods tend to keep corners fixed, and<br>
move the edges around independently through the middle slices (using<br>
&quot;slice&quot; moves). The other kinds of simultaneous movements that are<br>
possible on a Rubik&#x27;s cube (e.g. &quot;anti-slice&quot; moves) are not so common,<br>
and I don&#x27;t know of any standard metric that counts them as one move<br>
(even though they are often just as easy to perform as other kinds of<br>
simultaneous movement, e.g. r2&#x27;R as a simultaneous movement).<br>

4 center pieces, or 12 stickers.  Rotating a single face on a cube rotates
at least 4 edges and 4 corner pieces (and a center in position), or 20
stickers, and a center.

Following your logic, a double layer turn would count as two moves.  That
hardly seems correct.

Does that include time for memorization? Even with only 7 edges that 
would be very impressive for that short amount of practice...

I&#x27;d say with this method a piece is only lucky if it&#x27;s solved, i.e. at 
the correct place with the correct orientation. How many are allowed 
to be solved to still call it non-lucky? I don&#x27;t know :-). To be 
honest, I don&#x27;t (yet) care much about this because I&#x27;m not (yet) fast 
enough for it to matter. If I&#x27;m under 1:30 and I&#x27;d claim one of the 
top spots, then I&#x27;ll think about what&#x27;s lucky :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Wow, how much have you practiced? And how do you memorize?

I don&#x27;t know the reasoning behind the numbers you can see in the SCC 
rules. You might try to directly apply those rules to my method. Just 
be aware that (in)correct orientation doesn&#x27;t exist for pieces at the 
wrong &quot;position&quot; and that a piece is only correctly positioned if it&#x27;s 
both at the correct position and with the correct orientation. So you 
get:

For blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by:
1) more than 5 corners are solved, or
2) more than 8 edges are solved, or
3) more than 3 corners are solved, or
4) more than 4 edges are solved.

Which then collapses into:

For blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by:
a) more than 3 corners are solved, or
b) more than 4 edges are solved.

Note this is just a quick suggestion and by no means do I claim this 
is the way it should be done.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Ummm, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve practice quite a fair bit.  And I memorize a story
for the corners, and then store it in &quot;long term&quot; memory.  Then for
edges, I kind of say a story that I sub-conciously memorize, but I
make a mental image of the cube in my head, and the order that they
will go.  Neither is a hardfast memorisation, and I couldn&#x27;t tell you
the story more than 2 minutes after the solve.  I do memorisation
quickly, and then think and twist at the same time, cept for
corners...For corners I go through the story once, just to see where
everything is.  Then I go through, trying to remember, and counting
for parity, and then I usually do it once more just to make sure its
in my head.  If its a difficult solve, say maybe 3 or 4 cycles (which
may I add are evil) I&#x27;ll take a little longer to make sure its in my
head.  Then edges its basic memo.  Just long enough to put the
blindfold on and do the edges, then I forget it.

For 2x2 BLD the most you can have unsolved is 7.  So I just memorize a
set of colours, a lot like I do edges for 3x3.  its at most a string
of 6 colours.  One solve I did (had 3 corners solved) was Green Green
Red Red.

So you agree that the more than 4 corrected is
lucky...hmmm...intriguing...

Your method rocks Stefan, and if you can can you jump on yahoo???

Hmm... only a string of colors? I memorize a string of color pairs. Do 
you only memorize the color of the &quot;main&quot; sticker, i.e. the first 
color in each of my pairs? And then I guess you also store the 
additional information somewhat intuitively visually? That would be an 
interesting new approach...

Thanks, and no, I need to learn quite a bit for an exam in 10 days, so 
no chatting for me now (in addition to the general no-chatting-for-me

please understand it is not my intention to offend but the brief of 
my project is to design and build a 2D model with all its physical 
properties and limitations and to build a solution algorithm into it.

to demo my thinking i have just uploaded the design specs of my sim 
into the files section under Rubik 2D directory in a hope that you 
can better understand my problem. i am not looking at this in a speed 
cubing prospective just a research project into a problem i could 
never solve.

your input and responces over the last few days have been of immense 
value to me.. if anyone is willing i would like to be able to post my 
simulator which is working as a basic sim only for some of you to 
respond to.. i would greatly welcome any comments on in consistancies 
that you find in my work.

many thanks again

Kelvin

Maybe Mr Rubik had a part-time job in a restaurant when he was a young
architecture student?? Or maybe the person who wrote that doesn&#x27;t have a
clue and doesn&#x27;t know how to use Google?? ;)

          <div class="email-content">Posted that I had one of these a while ago.  Very tricky.  Clearly the 
intent is that each face is solved as a sudoku puizzle so they do respect 
the rules.  As for how many solutions - I&#x27;m still not sure - it may depend 
on whether you allow a solution with the numbers wrongly oriented with 
respect to each other on a given face.

I take some stuff from http://geocities.com/cubiks_ruber/ and

Use pure CMLL, learning NMCMLL (http://tinyurl.com/mjn9v)

I think I&#x27;m the only sub-20 roux cuber who uses non-matching blocks :D

I also use opposite blocks and inverted blocks, I don&#x27;t think there
are pages for any of these, because half of roux is finding out stuff
yourself.

          <div class="email-content">Chris did try for 4x4x4 after all the other events were over.  I 
think it ended in DNF, either that or they ran out of time.

I got Leyan&#x27;s 3x3x3 bld record on video, as well as Tyson&#x27;s almost-
tie.  I also got some of Chris doing his 5x5x5 memorizing, but he 
completed the solve only moments after Leyan&#x27;s record, so I only got 
the aftermath (lots of cheering!) on tape.  I&#x27;ll post clips when I 
get back home.

As for me, I got my first sub-30 solve in an official competition, 
so I was happy :)  It was a small but very well-organized event.  
Leyan also won the 3x3x3 competition.

Pulled out all the stops for this one :D (the 26.18 was a pop)

Thanks; Gilles, Dan, Paul, #rubik, etc. 

Roux is definatly my favourite method now.

Finally I can join the (not-so)-elite.

I&#x27;m 18 tomorrow, so this is the best present I could have had :)

Next I&#x27;m after sub-3 for BLD. I got a 3:13 today but meh...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m working on my intuitive F2L right now and can usually solve the F2L in between 35-60 seconds (i know, a broad range). I have a list of the algs, and I have deconstructed them and learned new techniques from them.. however, since they are optimized, there are some cases which are simply not intuitive. <br>
   <br>
  Has someone made a site which shows exactly how a good cubist would solve difficult cases intuitively?<br>
   <br>
  I don&#x27;t want to memorize these algs, so how should I deal with these cases? I can certainly solve them, but it&#x27;s slow. In some of these cases, I think it might be faster/easier to use the newbie method, solving the corner first and using an 8-move alg to insert the edge. Is that a good way of dealing with these cases?<br>
   <br>
  In general, after understanding the basics of intuitive F2L, how do I improve? (besides practice, practice, practice). Are there more advanced techniques?<br>
   <br>
  David <br>
   <br>
  ps--how many moves (90 degree) does it take you guys to solve the F2L (not including cross)?<br>

<br>
I was just thinking about this, and don&#x27;t know where the idea came<br>
from, but who on here would be interested if I restarted the Sunday<br>
Blindfold Contest that Chris Hardwick used to host?<br>
<br>
I would run it sort of like Chris did, with some minor differences. <br>
Right now I am just asking to see if you are interested.  So far the<br>
people that said they might enter are:<br>
<br>
Joël Van Noort<br>
Thom Barlow<br>
Leyan Lo(maybe)<br>
Craig Bouchard<br>
Casey Pernsteiner<br>
Chris Brownlee<br>
<br>
Either e-mail me at logitewty@... or repsond here.  I&#x27;m sure<br>
there are many others that would be interested.  I would run this like<br>
Jon Morris runs his Sunday Contest.  I&#x27;ll put up the scrambles.  You<br>
do them, and send in your times.  There will be different divisions,<br>
depending on what you want to do.  Like I said, this is just a<br>
preliminary count to see if there would be enough interest to consider<br>
hosting this.<br>

oh well. that&#x27;ll change next year, so i&#x27;m not too worried.

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s a few ideas:
For cases that have both pieces already in F2L, try just taking the 
pieces out (e.g. R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) and solving regularly
For instance, R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; for C2 (on Macky&#x27;s page: 
http://tinyurl.com/jbt67)
M2 can be solved by doing R U2 R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F U2 F&#x27; U F
Also, the case where the edge is flipped and the corner is solved 
can be solved by doing R U R&#x27; U2 R U2 R&#x27; U F&#x27; U&#x27; F

These are slightly longer than algs but I prefer many of them 
(except the one for M2: I like the F2L alg yU2L2U2LUL&#x27;UL2 listed on 
Macky&#x27;s page)

Hope this helps!
Tim

  Hey Everyone,

I was just thinking about this, and don&#x27;t know where the idea came
from, but who on here would be interested if I restarted the Sunday
Blindfold Contest that Chris Hardwick used to host?

I would run it sort of like Chris did, with some minor differences. 
Right now I am just asking to see if you are interested.  So far the
people that said they might enter are:

Joël Van Noort
Thom Barlow
Leyan Lo(maybe)
Craig Bouchard
Casey Pernsteiner
Chris Brownlee

Either e-mail me at logitewty@... or repsond here.  I&#x27;m sure
there are many others that would be interested.  I would run this like
Jon Morris runs his Sunday Contest.  I&#x27;ll put up the scrambles.  You
do them, and send in your times.  There will be different divisions,
depending on what you want to do.  Like I said, this is just a
preliminary count to see if there would be enough interest to consider
hosting this.

Thanks for reading my nonsense,
Craig Bouchard

I was looking at the multislotting images in the file section of 
this group and was having a hard time deciphering them.  It doesn&#x27;t 
seem that all the cases are shown.

Is this method basically pairing up a second pair as you insert the 
first pair?  Any tips to decipher?

Thanks.

          <div class="email-content">This weekend we&#x27;re doing a Rubik&#x27;s cube workshop for anyone interested<br>
on Aruba (I know most of you are not living on Aruba LOL).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wanted to ask people who have done such a thing before for<br>
some pointers. We are having a maximum of 14 people, and I have no<br>
idea who is going to show up. It&#x27;s going to be part of a day of<br>
events, and there might be kids and grown ups together. Since I don&#x27;t<br>
have that many cubes we also asked anyone to bring a cube if they have<br>
one.<br>
<br>
The workshop is only half an hour, so I guess I should really stick to<br>
people solving their cube once, and not really &quot;teaching it&quot;, or<br>
expect them to be able to solve it on their own. I will hand out a<br>
version of Jasmine&#x27;s or my own simple solotion.<br>
<br>
This afternoon there will be a local TV interview about the workshop.<br>
Any tips about what to do/say in the interview is also appreciated.<br>
It&#x27;s probably going to be quite brief.<br>

Rubik&#x27;s Cubes are like STDs, once you have them, you can&#x27;t get a
girlfriend...

And then I said, you know, there are actually 2 types of girls...The
ones explained above, and the ones that think its amazing are
like...MARRY ME!!!

Then I was like, just imagine, the perfect person, she is a GIRL and
she can solve Cube...and if she can do it sub-30 sweet...sub-20...not
fair shes faster than me...sub-15...i don&#x27;t want to go near
her...she&#x27;s more obsessed than me...sub-12, no comment...

Hehehe...I&#x27;m so bored...march break can do that to you...

          <div class="email-content">i learned intuitive f2l too, and like i think the best way to get faster is<br>
to just practic (tho im not anywhere near fast). and also, sometimes just<br>
sit down with the cube, and look at it. try to find a new way to solve that<br>
position. try out new things, different ways to solve the same positions.<br>
this will often improve your current method of solving a certain case or<br>
even spur a new idea, that helps later.<br>
<br>
i dunno how many moves i avg, but i average like somewhere around 18 seconds<br>
or so for f2l.<br>

good luck<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ryan, and everyone else,<br>
<br>
I posted a few days ago about this.<br>
<br>
I am looking into starting the Weekly (Sunday) Blindfold Contest<br>
again.  Chris Hardwick used to run this, and I am looking to take it<br>
off his hands, and reopen it.<br>
<br>
I have 2 options, and I am just wondering which you would prefer.  I<br>
am going to use an automated system to create the results tables.<br>
This is for the 3x3 &quot;competition.&quot;<br>
<br>
Option 1:<br>
Like in an Official Competition.<br>
<br>
Do 3 solves (or just one and say the others are DNS)and your Best of<br>
the 3 is what determines your rank, and therefore the winner, for the<br>
week.<br>
<br>
Option 2:<br>
Each scramble is its own &quot;competition.&quot;  Whoever comes in first place<br>
in Scramble 1 will be awarded n points, second place, x points, third<br>
place y points, and so on...<br>
Scramble 2 will be awarded points the same way.<br>
Scramble 3 the same as well.<br>
<br>
The Winner for the week would be the one with the highest total number<br>
of points.<br>
<br>
I am just asking because I want to know which of the two people would<br>
prefer.<br>
<br>
Also, I am thinking of having an Open Division where you can do any<br>
puzzle that you want (cube size or other puzzle) and input the time.<br>
You would only do 1 scramble per week for the Open Division per<br>
puzzle.  Does this sound reasonable for everyone???  And which of the<br>
2 options would you like more??? I was leaning towards Option 2, but<br>
I&#x27;ve heard from others to go for Option 1, and so I am asking you, the<br>
Blindfold community, which you would prefer.<br>
<br>
Also, I could set it up to determine the winner for the year, and have<br>
some kind of prize (of course thats long term...), and I need to get<br>
the contest up and running first.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading my nonsense,<br>
<br>
Craig Bouchard<br>
May the cube be with you...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m no expert.. probably not better than you. But, it sounds like you are solving the first two layers seperately. If this is the case, and your last layer is fast, you should prolly learn to solve the first two layers simultaneously using corner-edge pairs. The site that worked for me was:
   
  http://www.snkenjoi.com/wikicube/mediawiki-1.5.3/index.php?title=Intuitive_F2L
   
  I&#x27;m still learning this, and a good F2L time for me is 30 seconds... but, it is the method that most of the sweet cubists here use, and it&#x27;s possible to solve the F2L in 10 seconds w/ this method.

  Use a list of F2L algorithms to help you learn how to do them intuitively.

No, the results would be in the same table, but grouped together for
that specific puzzle.  There wouldn&#x27;t be a first place, second place,
and such.  Well, technically there would, but for the Open Division
there is no &quot;winner,&quot; it is more friendly competition to see who beats
who.  Of course if one of the puzzles in the Open Division becomes
popular enough I can make a new Division just for that puzzle.

<br>
I dont know if this is new, but I&#x27;ve been playing with a new OLL <br>
algorithm... Actually, it&#x27;s a commutator that was shown to me by Per, <br>
but I optimized it for my hands, and found out that it can be done <br>
quite fast.<br>
<br>
z&#x27; (U&#x27; R U2 r&#x27; U) L2 (U&#x27; r U2 R&#x27; U) L2 z<br>
<br>
The last L2 is just to make it a commutator... I speedcubing it&#x27;s not <br>
needed. One of the nice things about using this as an OLL is that for <br>
people that recognise the PLL with blocks, is that you can see where <br>
parts of a block will occur even before starting OLL, and also during <br>
OLL. You can also use the alg to create some funny patters with <br>
stripes btw :D.<br>

Well, I hope someone like this...<br>

Hahaha, of course it can also be done like this:

          <div class="email-content">The Rubik&#x27;s lube is good, and it even smells good.  And I thought it 
was silicone, just a very liquidy suspension of it.  It&#x27;s so liquidy 
that you almost have to let it dry out for a while after lubing it.  

Personally I prefer heavy weight silicone oil, like Shock Oil in 
hobby stores.  It&#x27;s odorless and the cube can be used right away.  

But if you already have the Rubik&#x27;s lube in hand, give it a shot.  
It&#x27;s good stuff, and you can always try the silicone oil later.

          <div class="email-content">the rubik&#x27;s cube lube, how do i apply it? could i just
assemble the cube and seep the lube through the cracks
or do i have to apply it to each one one by one?

i use silicone lubricant spray but lately it seems
like my cube is deteriorating from it even tho it says
its safe on plastic

          <div class="email-content">I figured it was the lube that felt different.  I guess it must be 
the white plastic...

But they describe their lube as a wax, which (I&#x27;m not up on my 
organic chem, however) I didn&#x27;t think silicone was?

a time.

Greetings.

I&#x27;ve been starting to count the number of moves I utilize in solving 
the F2L.  Counting 180 degree turns as 1 move, I&#x27;m averaging around 25-
29 moves for the F2L.  Is this reasonable, or should I be at a lower 
amount and am missing some shortcuts?

Thanks.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, the spectators had the run of the place to some degree.  It was 
an informal atmosphere, which was fun.  Sort of the opposite extreme 
from WC05, where the cameras prevented the front row spectators from 
seeing ANYTHING during the finals.  (There&#x27;s some killer footage out 
there somewhere; hopefully these documentaries will come to 
fruition!)

If I ever organize a competition (and I&#x27;ve thought about it), I 
would like to have multiple cameras set up and rolling, like one per 
timer.  Maybe an arrangement of tables in a square would prevent 
people from blocking the view.  Then everyone would have a nice high 
quality closeup video of each solve, and any records would be well-
documented.  Chris Hunt did a great job of documenting the Dallas 
event last summer.  I&#x27;m envisioning something at least that good.

serious).

          <div class="email-content">Hmm.. Yeah.. Well, for some cases, I can solve them with LL on the R 
face.. Some sunes for example..

Maybe you like this one (OLL):

F&#x27;U&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27;U) R b

(F&#x27; with right thumb, U&#x27; with left index please).

Or maybe you already knew that... Also, I start one of the PLL&#x27;s 
with LL on the right:

RUR&#x27;U&#x27; R U2 Z&#x27; Y&#x27; RUR&#x27;U&#x27; Y X L&#x27;U&#x27;LU L2 (try to make the cube 
rotations together with the moves here...)

Well, I hope you didn&#x27;t know these yet :).

my OLL with the F2L still on the left then put the LL

Thanks! This is the first 5x5 parity alg I learned that I can use 
for the last edges. :)

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s new.. but it&#x27;s cool! And pretty easy too!

If you got it apart without breaking anything, that&#x27;s amazing! Maybe
you can just slide it back together without taking the screw out.

<br>
I know this question has been asked before, but when searching the<br>
group  I couldn&#x27;t find the message, so I&#x27;m asking again. I had a copy<br>
of a Rubik&#x27;s Cube song, but now can&#x27;t find it or remember where I got<br>
it, or find it in the quick Google search I just did.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the lyrics include something like this:<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#x27;ve never peeled off the stickers<br>
or taken apart the pieces<br>
or looked at any books with a solution.<br>
But I&#x27;m gonna get that bottom line<br>
if it takes all my time. <br>
Don&#x27;t wanna add to next year&#x27;s resolutions.&quot;<br>

Hey, man 
thanks for the suggestion.  I&#x27;m only 14 and that would take days with 
my method.

I&#x27;ve been counting my number of moves to make the cross on the bottom <br>
layer and I think they suck.  Generally, I&#x27;ve been averaging 7-9 moves <br>
and it seems most can be constructed in 5-6 (at least from what I&#x27;ve <br>

<br>
Could one of the experienced cubers mentor me by giving me some <br>
scrambles and then get back on how they would assemble that cross on <br>
the given scramble?  I think I&#x27;m missing something.<br>

A couple of weeks ago I found these two algs for the 4x4x4:<br>
<br>
1. B&#x27; R&#x27; [(Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)&#x27; B2<br>

2. B&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; [(Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)&#x27; B2<br>
(Rr)2] F R B<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t use these algs for speedcubing (unless I see that I would have<br>
a OLL skip after using one the algs), but maybe it is useful for the<br>
people who still use a 3look-LL (EO, CO, PLL) or a 4look-LL for the 3x3x3.<br>

I just got a 5x5 (east sheen). I&#x27;m able to solve it now, but I need to<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve tried out most of the methods out there...including a hybrid one
I made myself.  

http://www.bigcubes.com  has a good solution.

http://idahocubers.com/video/55512036.wmv

Watch that video.  It is probably the top 5x5 solver in the world
doing a full 5x5 Average.  Just by watching you can learn a lot...(PS,
the bigcubes website is on his method)

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s from the album &quot;Virgin White Lies&quot;, which was released way back 
in 1997. 

You can purchase the album from both Amazon.com (used) and 
cdconnection.com (new). Samples from the album are available at both 
sites - sounds like a fun pop album.

I&#x27;ll put the MP3 in the &quot;Files&quot; section of this group, then post 
here with the link.

Very nice alg :). Do you also have a good alg for this (non-parity)

Now I do this in two quick steps:

I was interesting in finding out more about other Australia speedcubers.<br>
I&#x27;ve set up a database over in the Australian speedcubers yahoo group<br>
(http://au.groups.yahoo.com/group/australianspeedcubers/) and was<br>
wondering if there are any Australian speedcubers here, if they wouldn&#x27;t<br>
popping over and filling it out! :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">i to am looking for an alg for this dreaded 10th case.  i am doing it in 2 parts also, (well at least the 2 times its come up)  its pretty rare but i would like to find a good way to take care of it, maybe if frederick is nice enough to explain the process on the applets he uses we can all experiment a little bit.

 and ignored pieces, and/or more algs i will post them for all.  sorry to all about the dirty laundry being aired on the forum.

 I understand your position.
 You don&#x27;t have to mention anybody if you don&#x27;t want to do it.
 No problem.
 
 Just learn how to say hello, and to get a clue within the sites that already exist.
 
 Macky and Stephan had the courtesy to mention the origins of the algs they had published....
 
 An other point, what do you mean with &quot;get a clue&quot; ?
 
 And it&#x27;s another problem than ego to say I&#x27;m a liar.
 All algs on your page came from my post on the international forum, I publish them for the first time on the french forum, the others on your page are the trivial case without the parity problem.
 
 I will forward a mail I had with Stephan.....
Why don&#x27;t you publish the alg to correct the double parity error for the 444 ? It&#x27;s the same than one of the 555.
 
 Anybody can use a cube solver applet ? Nope for the big cubes. 
 A cube solver gave many solutions for a configuration. Why chose one or an others ? It&#x27;s just a personnal choice.
 So why it&#x27;s my algs you decided to publish ?
 
 Have fun,
 Frederick.

 Hi Clancy, 
 
 all parity algs on your website come from me (message 12920 on this
 forum), except Chris Hardwick&#x27;s one which is longer than mine. 
 
 Few months ago, I asked you a friendly question about the credit page
 of bigcubes.com 
 
 According to your answers ( with no polite words, like &quot;hello&quot; by
 example), you doubted I found them by myself, and you said anybody
 could find algs because it&#x27;s easy with computers. 
 
 So, if it&#x27;s so easy, do it by yourself, publish your own algs or
 respect the others. 
 
 I can refresh your memory if you don&#x27;t remember what your answers were. 
 
 You said :
 
 &quot;&quot;well i have never even seen the page you posted, i got all of those
 algorithms from frank morris, he said some of them came may have come
 from ron, stefan, chris and others, including you, although you are
 the only one that feels the need to claim any credit for these.  feel
 free to ask frank about his involvement in this project.  if some algs
 trickled down to him from you great, but i really doubt you found
 every single one of those on your own, since lots of people could and
 can solve the professor long before you....and furthermore i don&#x27;t
 think anyone &quot;owns&quot; algorithms....the reason i mentioned his name is
 because he actually helped me, and didn&#x27;t just want credit for
 something anyone could have found, lots of people know how to run cube
 solver applets.  I haven&#x27;t really given anyone credit for anything
 yet, i was more concerned with bettering the cubing community and
 getting more people into solving larger cubes than an ego trip.&quot;&quot;
 &quot;&quot;again i NEVER saw the post u showed me, ask frank morris he sent me
 all of those algs. and i will be happy to give credit to anyone that
 has contributed to the big cube community, but as i said the site isn&#x27;t
 done, i wanted to give people that information since i had seen
 repeated frequent posts regarding those last 2 sets of edges.  i plan
 on expanding the site site to 4x4 also, but since there is already a
 decent method method on this on chris&#x27; site the 5x5 was my first
 focus. again i don&#x27;t claim to have made these up, honestly i don&#x27;t
 care who did, i&#x27;m interested in providing the information to everyone.
  and yes
 everyone can use a solver for larger cubes, you&#x27;re not the only one
 capable of writing or using solving programs. for the fourth time, i
 didn&#x27;t choose any of these algorithms, as i said they were given to me
 by frank.  i said get a clue because these are not YOUR algs.  they
 are everyone&#x27;s.  i thought all cubers were less selfish than that and
 more concerned about helping everyone to get as good as they can be.  but
 be rest assured when i get to the credits page which is my LAST
 priorty, your name will surely be mentioned as i am fully aware of
 your contributions to the big cube community.  it seems a litte
 ridiculous that within no time of that being posted all that you are
 concerned about credit for algs that many people have and use. Feel
 free to message me if u want to continue this conversation, also i&#x27;m
 sure frank can vouch for the fact that EVERY SINGLE last 2 edge
 algorithm on that page, was given to me by him. now i&#x27;m kind of busy
 trying to make the best site for larger cubes on the net, so kindly
 excuse me if i don&#x27;t have time to give credit to everyone who thinks
 they discovered something that was around long before they had picked
 a cube up.&quot;&quot;
 
 
 For your &quot;dreaded 10th case&quot;, I posted :
 (F2) (Rr) D2 (Rr)&#x27; F2 U2 F2 (Ll) B2 (Ll)&#x27; F2
 It&#x27;s in the message 12920.
 
 Have fun,
 Frédérick.

Let me know what you guys think of it. I try to keep things really <br>

the 2D images with arrows).<br>

          <div class="email-content">If only a single piece comes out, or even an edge and a corner, couldn&#x27;t it
still count as solved?  The orientation and permutation of the last edge and
last corner are forced, so even if they aren&#x27;t in the cube, it is possible
to tell whether or not the cube is solved.  Doesn&#x27;t it say in the WCA rules
that a cube still counts as solved if a defect such as a center cap falling
off or a center twisting in a 5x5x5 occurs?  So wouldn&#x27;t this be the same
idea?  The puzzle _is_ unambiguously solved.

Just my thoughts

<br>
First day of the swedish cube contest in Norrköping is over. Anssi set<br>
a new WR for foot solving with an amazing time of 1:18.??. (Don&#x27;t<br>
remember the hundreds).<br>
<br>
Anssi also set new european records for one-handed  solving with a<br>
best time of 25.17 and an average of 30.99.<br>
<br>
All of the results will be posted on speedcubing.com tomorrow or on<br>
monday.<br>

The cube popped during my final move, and before I realized it I had  
stopped the timer.

And that&#x27;s a DNF, of course Technically, the solve isn&#x27;t over until  
you&#x27;ve stopped the timer.

What I am describing is when you have finished the cube, you go to let
go of it to stop the timer, and you accidentally pull a piece out. 
Its not in any way a result of the solve...

          <div class="email-content">But you stopped the timer.  Stopping the timer is the recognition that 
you are happy with the resting state of the cube.  If you were more 
careful, you could put the cube down, take a couple seconds to examine 
everything, and then stop the timer.  Instead, because you choose to 
stop the timer quickly, you risk suffering those consequences.

          <div class="email-content">During the Rubik&#x27;s Clock event I actually do something a bit like this.
It&#x27;s easy to accidentally leave one clock on the back side unsolved and
not realise it, so I always give each side a quick check at the end,
before I hit the timer. It does mean I waste 1-2 seconds, but since I&#x27;m
not going to be breaking any world records anyway, I&#x27;d rather accept the
extra 1-2 seconds than have a DNF! :)

Peter Greenwood insisted that I do a video where he sees the scramble,

Today at the swedish cube contest Anssi Vanhala from Finland, broke<br>
the world record for &quot;3*3*3 - average of 5&quot; two times. Fiurst with<br>
14.40 in the semifinals and later with a fantastic time of 13.22<br>

WOW, that&#x27;s simply stunning! Congratulations Anssi! I saw him cubing
at Finnish Cube Meeting a couple months ago and he is incredibly fast,
so this World Record was just a matter of time ;) although I must
admit that I didn&#x27;t expect this to happen so soon. Seems like Anssi
has very good nerves when it comes to solving in competitions. If I
remember correctly, this wasn&#x27;t his first time when he beat his
personal record in a competition. But I still can&#x27;t understand how he
can solve so quickly with so bad stickers :).

Gunnar finished in second place with an average of 17.95. In the semis
he set a new national record with  an average of 17.55. When I see
them solve live I think it looks like Gunnar turns faster. Anssi&#x27;s
turning just looks so relaxed, like he is not going at full speed. But
put them next to each other and its obvious that Anssi&#x27;s way is far
more efficient.

doing it for nearly a year or so, I guess.  I mainly just forgot a

         Wow! may 23, 2003 ? That was my 7th birth day. I had never seen a cube then. But, now I am one among you in the top-100. Thanks Gunner for your ststistics. I am inspired by you all.
         I may be the youngest. Who is the oldest? How old is he/she? How many are under 15 , under 12 and under 10. Just a curiosity to know.

With the given times : 14.08 12.81 12.77 12.47 14.09 and anssi&#x27;s 
claim of losing out 1 sec on the last solve due to a bad OLL this 
avg could have been:

(14.08) 12.81 (12.77) 12.47 13.09 => 12.79

OMG! A sub 13 competition average!! Even if not a full 12/10 average 
that would have been absolutely crazy ;-)

Congratz Anssi :D 13.22 aint so bad either :-P

          <div class="email-content">I can&#x27;t believe the Rubik&#x27;s site actually links to Ton&#x27;s site for assembling
a DIY cube.  First of all, unless Ton is property of Rubiks.com, they have
no guarantee that he&#x27;s going to continue hosting his content.  And second,
none of his advice has anything to do with assembling a new DIY cube.

The washer goes in first, then the spring, then the screw.  No glue is
needed to assemble the internals of the cube.

    Hi !
 
 With the given times : 14.08 12.81 12.77 12.47 14.09 and anssi&#x27;s 
 claim of losing out 1 sec on the last solve due to a bad OLL this 
 avg could have been:
 
 (14.08) 12.81 (12.77) 12.47 13.09 => 12.79
 
 OMG! A sub 13 competition average!! Even if not a full 12/10 average 
 that would have been absolutely crazy ;-)
 
 Congratz Anssi :D 13.22 aint so bad either :-P

          <div class="email-content">I know I&#x27;m not quite in the category you&#x27;re asking about, but I can tell
you that around the time of Worlds last year (Nov) I was practising
quite regularly and I was averaging ~28.xx-29.xx. I haven&#x27;t cubed much
in the months since Worlds and did my first big cube session last
weekend. I did ~160 solves and the average was ~30.7x. :( Also, I&#x27;d
forgotten about 5-6 of the OLLs I&#x27;d learnt around the time of Worlds. :(
Basically, any algs that hadn&#x27;t moved into my long term memory by the
time of Worlds have since been forgotten! So, I know I need to practice
regular to maintain my average!

On the plus side though, I&#x27;m confident that it will be pretty easy to
re-learn the algs that I have forgotten. Also, I don&#x27;t think it will
take too long to get my average back down to 28.xx. For me, the thing
that most excites and inspires me is cubing events and meeting up with
other cubers. Late last year was great - Dutch Open in October, Worlds
and Hungary in Nov, UK speedcubers meeting in Dec - plenty of
speedcubing events to keep me going! Since I&#x27;m not going to the German
Open (I&#x27;d *really* love to be there, but it&#x27;s the same day as my
brother&#x27;s wedding!) it means I haven&#x27;t practiced as much in recent
months. I&#x27;m worried that my next big cubing event might not be till
Dutch Open 2006!! That&#x27;s so far away. I don&#x27;t know if I can wait that
long!! :D

Hey,

Well.. I don&#x27;t need daily 3x3 practice to stay sub-20... But that&#x27;s 
because I am much faster than 20 seconds.. Usually, after not 
practicing for a week or two, I usually feel I lost 2 or 3 seconds 
or so when I pick up the cube again.. But after a nice amount of 
solves, it all gets back to me quickly. But during the first few 
cubes, I always feel like I lost my &#x27;touch&#x27;. 

I think I&#x27;ve done all my CFOP algorithms somany times that I can&#x27;t 
ever forget them... 

- Joël.

Hi,

I think that when your old, busted, wrinkled, delusional, losing your
memory and have hands like stiff twigs; you get a cube in your hands,
you can still remember almost any algorithm from back when you were
speedcubing :P

          <div class="email-content">Hey Michiel,

Great game!  I&#x27;m up to 2.894 so far.  My routine has an ok beginning, 
a great middle, and a horrible end though.  I can see how this can be 
made much faster.

Need to work on a better way to begin and end, but I like my middle 
third a lot!

Gonna keep working at this.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s no way to keep this fair.  Obviously the people in the high score
list didn&#x27;t play on an &quot;honest&quot; keyboard.  If you re-map your keyboard from
QWERTY to ABCDEF, there&#x27;s no challenge.

But it is a great game.  If it would be possible to enforce one of a few
keyboard configurations, I&#x27;d keep at it.  But already the records are
corrupt, so there&#x27;s really no way to gauge what a competitive time would
be.  That&#x27;s why I like the cube so much.  It&#x27;s impossible to cheat! :-)

me and quinn played this a while ago, I got down to 1.8 and he got
down to 1.5, I think.

the video high score list is the only decent one, you can see no
cheating then.

Oh, and there&#x27;s a better way to cheat, write a program to send
keypresses :)

Did you lube the cube to get it to fly nicely?  Do you think that these <br>
DIY cubes are all amazing, or that you got lucky with a good one?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I like to assemble as follows:

1. Put the springs on the screws, followed by the washer.  Make the 
flat side of the washer face the spring.  Insert the 
screw/spring/washer into the center.  Do that for all six.

2. Using a screwdriver, push the screw all the way into one of the 
centers (compressing the spring all the way), then screw it into the 
burr.  Make sure you screw it in as straight as possible.  Stop when 
you get about 0.5 mm from the burr.  Do that for all six.

3. Assemble the edges and corners to complete the cube.

4. Cut six square pieces of paper the same size as the center (use 
the center caps to trace the outline onto paper before cutting).  
Lay each square so it covers the center.  It should rest neatly 
between the surrounding four edge pieces.  Mash the cap onto the 
center, deforming the paper as you press it in.  The tension will 
keep the cap in place nicely.  Do that for all six.

5. Break the cube in before lubing, to remove any stray plastic 
shavings.  Don&#x27;t worry if it feels too tight.

6. Turn two adjacent faces a tiny bit, to create an opening near a 
center.  Drop a few drops of silicone oil into the opening, then 
scramble the cube thoroughly.  Careful not to get the paper pieces 
wet (replace them if they do).

7. Adjust the tension by temporarily removing the center caps and 
loosening each screw the same amount.

8. Sticker and enjoy!

Chris

Dvorak is fun, I had a serious go at trying to convert to it a while

Hey Joel,<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t try to type it correctly, try to view it as a finger trick on <br>
the cube.<br>
<br>
I use QWERTY and I did this,<br>
<br>
Start with left hand ring finger on &quot;A&quot;, left hand index finger on &quot;D&quot; <br>
right hand index finger on &quot;C&quot; and right hand middle finger on &quot;B&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now press the keys in order and then press &quot;E&quot; with you left index <br>
then drag your right index finger over &quot;F&quot; &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; hitting all <br>
three, then hit &quot;I&quot; with your left index while pausing your right <br>
index finger.  Once you&#x27;ve hit &quot;I&quot; continue dragging your right index <br>
finger over &quot;J&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;L&quot; hitting all three.<br>
<br>
Then I drag for &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; then also for &quot;O&quot; and &quot;P&quot; then for Q-Z I <br>
just hit the keys alternating left and right hand fingers.  That&#x27;s the <br>
part I don&#x27;t have a routine for, and the end is much slower than my <br>
beginning.<br>
<br>
I can see how doing it with dragging for hitting groups of nearby keys <br>
can help.  For example if you have to hit &quot;Q&quot; then &quot;R&quot; then &quot;S&quot; just <br>
drag your left index from &quot;Q&quot; to &quot;R&quot; hitting all keys in between then <br>
drag back over &quot;E&quot; then diagonal to &quot;S&quot;.<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t worry that you hit more keys, the program has no penalty for <br>
this and also you can hit them faster this way than by conventional <br>
typing.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, no idea how to get this under 2 seconds.  I imagine <br>
you have to use a better routine than what I do.<br>
<br>
Also I like the idea of mapping the keyboard to ABCDEFGH and just <br>
dragging a finger across each row, hitting all keys in 0.1 seconds or <br>
something :-)  But of course that would be cheating.<br>
<br>
I wonder if QWERTY or DVORAK would be faster, which has keys grouped <br>
together well for dragging your finger across them?<br>
<br>
Either way this is fun, it&#x27;s like trying to find a fast way to do a <br>
cube PL alg, we have the moves, now how do we do them quickly?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Did you use the washers?  There may be a tiny rattle when you shake 
the cube, but not much.  It&#x27;s probably due to the lack of that 
annoying tab that the old ones had.  That made the corners not 
rattle, but it also made for very uneven tightness, depending on the 
orientation of adjacent corners.

I test a cube by doing the following:  Grab the BUL and BUR corners 
and pry the L and R faces apart from each other.  The gap between 
these two corners and the BU edge should be about 2mm.  Then when 
you release them, they should spring back and touch the BU edge 
again.  If the cube is too loose, it won&#x27;t spring back properly, 
leaving a gap between corner and edge (a lot of store-bought cubes 
suffer this problem).  If it&#x27;s too tight, you will barely be able to 
get them apart 2mm.  I&#x27;m not using a micrometer or anything, so it 
may be more like 1.7mm or something.  And of course, everyone has a 
different preference depending on their cubing style.

Don&#x27;t most people here use white opp yellow?  I didn&#x27;t think it was a 
sign of old age.

The 25th anniversary cubes (at any rate the ones in Tesco in the UK 
right now) have white opp yellow... it might be a special &quot;retro&quot; 
edition, I suppose.  Pity the quality isn&#x27;t also &quot;retro&quot;. :(

          <div class="email-content">Yes, quite right. If you bought a cube in the early 80ies, you got, as I see it, with a 50%  chance a BOY or BYO cube. (Now I never get a BYO cube).

Though, some old cubes have the BYO color scheme, instead of the BOY
which is nowadays the most common.

No ?

          <div class="email-content">Sounds like a Studio Cube would fit your needs.  Head over to 
TwistyPuzzles.com and check the marketplace forum.  Or look on Ebay.  
The Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes are essentially identical to the best 1980&#x27;s 
cubes (complete with vinyl stickers, flourescent orange, old logo, the 
color scheme you like, and soft plastic).  It&#x27;s basically like having 
access to a time machine to the 80s!  But cube technology has 
improved, and you might find a DIY kit better in the long run for 
serious speedcubing.  Also don&#x27;t forget cubesmith.com for sticker 
replacements.

No, it wasn&#x27;t meant as an absolute endorsement of the old cubes.  But 
the 25th now being sold in the Tesco supermarkets here can be /truly/ 
awful.  The rivets have been hammered in so tight that the cube will 
barely turn -- even a mediocre old cube would be better!

I often read enthusiastic posts about cube X or cube Y.<br>
But:<br>
1) Quality is not a constant.<br>
2) It depends on personal preference or dexterity (mood...). For<br>
example I liked the soft plastic of Studio cubes a lot, but I can&#x27;t<br>
use them because of the &quot;pop&quot; factor. But Studio cubes are perfect for<br>
other cubers.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect speedcube.<br>
I agree that the perfect speedcubes from the eighties are a myth. By<br>
the way, I remember Jessica telling me that one of the reasons why<br>
speedcubers are now faster may be the quality of cubes regarding speed.<br>
<br>
I would recommend buying a Rubik&#x27;s DIY cube. Because you assemble it<br>
(with screws), you&#x27;ll get something that&#x27;s at least good enough.<br>
<br>
My problem comes from the 4^3.<br>
I bought 4 cubes, and they&#x27;re all good for nothing.<br>
I wanted to practice to get faster, but with such a piece of crap, I<br>
can&#x27;t average sub-90.<br>
Fred Badie and Frank Morris told me they were given very good cubes in<br>
Toronto, still usable and fast.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Agreed!  My own enthusiasm comes from the fact that for many years 
during the 90s, it seemed difficult to find the perfect cube.  I had a 
few cubes from 1981-82, but for collector&#x27;s purposes I didn&#x27;t want to 
continue beating them up.  Yet the new ones (OzzdOn) had terrible 
stickers.  Meffert&#x27;s assembly cubes were good from an aesthetic 
standpoint, but not for speedcubing.

Now it seems that we are in a golden age of cubing, where we not only 
have access to various excellent cubes (anniversary, DIY, white DIY, 
studio, Eastsheen) but also cheap access to the technology to improve 
and customize them even further (CubeSmith, silicone oil, etc.)  And I 
agree that the new cubes have probably contributed significantly to 
the ability for top cubers to achieve the (formerly) unimaginably fast 
solve times.

Still, the quest for the perfect cube continues.  And of course, many 
of us still dream of an electronic cube, with LED or LCD panels for 
stickers, built-in timer, recognition of solved state, instant 
randomize, etc.

Yes, the old screws (and the new) do have there advantage. IF you can open the cap and adjust them. It happened to me more than once that I had to saw it away, only to see that the middle was filled up with glue.Many, many in the old times bought themselves only one cube and to get such a failure must have been very frustrating..

Actually let me correct my statement from an hour ago. Saying 
&quot;silicone can be oil&quot; is just as bad as &quot;silicone is oil&quot;. What I 
meant was &quot;If you have some (specific) silicone, it can be oil.&quot;.

But I should better just say &quot;some silicones are oil&quot;.

Cheers!

Some more ideas...

The alg Craig posted but with proper setup moves:
R U&#x27; F (Rr)2 (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2

Please try on 3x3 and translate to 5x5 (hope you get the idea):
U&#x27; 2*(R2&#x27; U&#x27; r2 U F2) U

I just realized the inner part might be interesting for some 
orient-first 3x3 blindcubers:

2 * (R2&#x27; U&#x27; r2 U F2)

And of course also its various variations, e.g.

2 * (F2 R2&#x27; U&#x27; r2 U)
2 * (U F2 R2&#x27; U&#x27; r2)
2 * (L2 U l2 U&#x27; F2)

          <div class="email-content">Okay, so this is what happened.  Originally, I was going to do US <br>
Nationals at Caltech, and everything was going to be very quick and <br>
easy, but then someone, and I think his name begins with a &quot;Mike,&quot; <br>
spoke up and said that something like Vegas would be really fun.  Then <br>
more of you guys, (rhymes with badam) chimed in and agreed that US <br>
Nationals 2006 in Vegas would be really fun.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m really close to this.  However, I need help from you guys.  <br>
Basically, I&#x27;m going to look like a fool if we can&#x27;t draw 100 <br>
competitors, so please help me out.  The competition is scheduled for <br>
August 5 and 6.  That&#x27;s a weekend, Saturday to Sunday.<br>
<br>
We had 56 people for US Nationals.  Everyone native to California is <br>
within driving distance of Vegas.  That should be 100 people right <br>
there.  PLEASE HELP ME!  I&#x27;m putting a lot on the line here.  If this <br>
thing flops, I look like a big fool, people get pissed at me, and all <br>
that other stuff, and it just sucks a lot for me.<br>
<br>
So yeah, tell your friends, get people addicted to cubing, get people <br>
to go to US Nationals.  Look at your calendars, try to keep August 5 to <br>
6 free, and yes...<br>
<br>
The goal... 100 competitors, or else Tyson sucks.  I&#x27;ll look really bad <br>
if 20 people show up to this thing.<br>
<br>
Is money your problem?  I have ideas to help you raise money.  If you <br>
can find a large group of people who want to learn how to cube, I&#x27;ll <br>
try to work out a way so that you can get cubes for cheap, sell them, <br>
and make some money to go to Vegas.<br>
<br>
Or do what Frank Morris does and get a company to sponsor you.<br>
<br>
Please come!<br>
<br>
Note — Vegas is not finalized yet, but it&#x27;s getting really close, and <br>
I&#x27;m going to be very nervous if it does get finalized... because I&#x27;m <br>
basically promising them 100 competitors.  We had 56 in San <br>
Francisco... we should be able to do 100 for a national competition.<br>

Just so the non-United States people know about this, the US National <br>
2006 competition will be open to everyone.  We&#x27;re going to host <br>

So, international competitors will be in their own bracket, but we&#x27;ll <br>

I&#x27;m trying really hard to come, but I dunno if I&#x27;m going to be able to
make it.  I&#x27;ve wanted to since I heard about it, but I&#x27;ll have to wait
and see.  I&#x27;m also looking into finally going to some other
competitions soon...:)

          <div class="email-content">Hello cubeheads!<br>
<br>
This is my first mail to the list, I just joined yesterday. I&#x27;m 22<br>
years old and solved the cube for the first time a few months ago,<br>
using a beginner layer-by-layer method. I haven&#x27;t started my<br>
speedcubing carrier very intensively, just cubing a little here and<br>
there, so my average is around 60 seconds, still with the beginner<br>
method.<br>
<br>
Recently I started looking at improving my cross speed, solving the<br>
cross in D and the Fridrich F2L algos. If any of you wickedly fast out<br>
there can remember what it was like when you first learned the F2L,<br>
and have any tips/suggestions et.c. you&#x27;re more than welcome to share<br>
them with me.<br>
<br>
At first I started with having the algos for the 41 cases beside me,<br>
printed on a piece of paper.. But the last couple of days I&#x27;m starting<br>
to think that it&#x27;s better to work out them out intuitively. What was<br>
your approach? Trying to figure them out by myself, it feels as if I<br>
learn them better, as if they &quot;stick&quot; better in my head, but I&#x27;m<br>
worried that often I make unneccessary moves, that could fast turn<br>
into a bad habit.<br>
<br>
Anyway, glad I found this fine sport. It kills off time when I&#x27;m<br>
sitting in my bookshop with no customers ;)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure there are more questions for this list that I&#x27;ve thought of,<br>
but can&#x27;t remember at the moment.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Aron Stansvik<br>

I don&#x27;t promise at all that I&#x27;ll come, but I guess that you might have
some canadian guys who would be interested in that championship.

Just a thought.

Just a small note : hotels in Las Vegas are quite cheap, what&#x27;s
expensive is the casino :D
Congratulations Tyson for this organisation that looks like a quite big event.

Have fun !

Okay, so this is what happened.  Originally, I was going to do US <br>
Nationals at Caltech, and everything was going to be very quick and <br>
easy, but then someone, and I think his name begins with a &quot;Mike,&quot; <br>
spoke up and said that something like Vegas would be really fun.  Then <br>
more of you guys, (rhymes with badam) chimed in and agreed that US <br>
Nationals 2006 in Vegas would be really fun.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m really close to this.  However, I need help from you guys.  <br>
Basically, I&#x27;m going to look like a fool if we can&#x27;t draw 100 <br>
competitors, so please help me out.  The competition is scheduled for <br>
August 5 and 6.  That&#x27;s a weekend, Saturday to Sunday.<br>
<br>
We had 56 people for US Nationals.  Everyone native to California is <br>
within driving distance of Vegas.  That should be 100 people right <br>
there.  PLEASE HELP ME!  I&#x27;m putting a lot on the line here.  If this <br>
thing flops, I look like a big fool, people get pissed at me, and all <br>
that other stuff, and it just sucks a lot for me.<br>
<br>
So yeah, tell your friends, get people addicted to cubing, get people <br>
to go to US Nationals.  Look at your calendars, try to keep August 5 to <br>
6 free, and yes...<br>
<br>
The goal... 100 competitors, or else Tyson sucks.  I&#x27;ll look really bad <br>
if 20 people show up to this thing.<br>
<br>
Is money your problem?  I have ideas to help you raise money.  If you <br>
can find a large group of people who want to learn how to cube, I&#x27;ll <br>
try to work out a way so that you can get cubes for cheap, sell them, <br>
and make some money to go to Vegas.<br>
<br>
Or do what Frank Morris does and get a company to sponsor you.<br>
<br>
Please come!<br>
<br>
Note - Vegas is not finalized yet, but it&#x27;s getting really close, and <br>
I&#x27;m going to be very nervous if it does get finalized... because I&#x27;m <br>
basically promising them 100 competitors.  We had 56 in San <br>

I use the same method one handed as two but you prbably will want to 
optimise some algorithms as you get better.
Chris Hardwick has a lot of tips on

Good luck

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working a lot on my 4x4x4 edges method and I have found a <br>
new approach that I really like a lot and have switched to.<br>
<br>
I used to use only RDdL turns to pair up my edges, and occasionaly I <br>
would change my storage and pairing layers if I saw something better <br>
to pair.<br>
<br>
Then I saw that Yuki (from what I have seen on his videos, and again <br>
I could be wrong) seems to use RuUL turns to do most of his pairing.<br>
<br>
I tried doing this and often got fast times, but sometimes I would <br>
still have slow edges because of not being able to find a piece I <br>
needed.<br>
<br>
Then I tried mixing the best parts of both and I have to say I like <br>
this better.  I now view the edges in a way of just trying to pair <br>
two edges up.  I do this however is convenient based on how I am <br>
holding the cube.  So I mostly use rUudDL moves to do my pairing.  I <br>
also move around the cube a lot and don&#x27;t stick to just the d and u <br>
layers to pair.  If I see other pieces I like somewhere else I <br>
switch to them instead of sticking with my 2 pair chain like on my <br>
4x4x4 speed solve solution page.<br>
<br>
My philosopy used to be to be a little less efficient but to have a <br>
mindless process that I can do without having to think.  Now I like <br>
to make it a little more efficient, and add a little more thought <br>
into it, but it seems to be working so far.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know what my times will be doing it this way, but I can only <br>
hope it will be faster.  I feel like getting a sub-60 solve this way <br>
is much easier than with my old method, and I&#x27;ve even gotten a sub-<br>
60 double parity solve using this new approach, so I want to work on <br>
it.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if others use this idea, but my philosophy has changed <br>
for 4x4 edges.  I now just pair up whatever I see, instead of <br>
following a rigid chain like I used to.<br>
<br>
Not sure if anyone already does this, but I feel like I can improve <br>
and move past the barrier I am at by trying this.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps for anyone interested in the 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  Now if only I could stop being lazy and work on my centers, <br>
they&#x27;re 2-3 seconds slower than most people I&#x27;ve talked to :-(  Does <br>
anyone have a good centers approach?  I feel like my edges must be <br>
fairly good to overcome my slower than average centers, anyone <br>
willing to trade centers tricks for some edges tricks?<br>

Oh your god!!!

After watching the video, I think I should stop speedcubing (but not
cubing). I would feel like running behind Carl Lewis, or chasing a
Testarossa with my Renault Mégane! (-> ridiculous)

          <div class="email-content">I see his method and his 13.88 average and it just amazes me.  I think <br>
it&#x27;s great that he was able to come up with a new method that is (or <br>
seems to be) as fast as Fridrich.  I don&#x27;t really want to learn <br>
Fridrich because there are so many people using it and I thought I <br>
would try something else.  Also, someone has to test his method.<br>
<br>
I also thought about learning Petrus (and using the algorithms Josef <br>
Jelinek made) but it seems like it is slower.<br>
<br>
What kind of averages should I expect to get?  I haven&#x27;t seen anyone <br>
have an average close to Lars with his method so is the same thing <br>
going to happen with this and not many people are going to get sub 20?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on it and I finally figured out how to use Gilles <br>
corners table (after asking him how).  My fastest time with it so far <br>
is only 53 seconds.  I am really slow in the beginning building the <br>
blocks but in the end I am really fast.  I haven&#x27;t learned all of the <br>
corners algorithms yet either.<br>

I tried that method (printing out the F2L algs and looking at the 
sheet as I did them).  everyone learns differently, but for me that 
didn&#x27;t help because there were just too many and I just got 
confused.  better approach for me was to learn a few at a time and 
also explore intuitively so I understood what the alg does.  Also 
helpful is meeting up with other cubers to learn from them directly--
don&#x27;t know where you are, but these days it seems odds are good 
there&#x27;s another cuber somewhere relatively close.  

I don&#x27;t know all of the algs, but I know enough for where I&#x27;m at as 
a cuber.  If you learn a handful really well, and you get a case for 
an alg you don&#x27;t know yet, with very little practice you can usually 
manipulate it rather easily into a case for which you do know the 
alg.  [I suppose that could be viewed as knowing an alg for that 
case, just not an optimal alg].  

Good luck!

  I also have a sheet with the 41 algs, and they help a LOT to show you how to do it efficiently. Once you get the basics down of intuitive F2L, start using the alg sheet and understanding how it works.

My average for the centers is around 15 seconds, so you may be faster
than that, ubt I can tell you what my approach is.

First I build the white and yellow centers on opposite sides, then I
build whatever center that seems fast to build, having the yellow
centers to the right. I have remembered the order that the colors are
coming in if I rotate the cube along the x-axis, Green-Red-Blue-Purple
(Meffert&#x27;s color scheme), and I build them in that way. 

Piece of cake... :-D

I&#x27;ll be the cool one who does something different&quot;. Which is fun, but
less support is avaliable for roux. This is actually an advantage. You
find out everything yourself and a lot of the time you invent looads
of little tricks. basically you&#x27;re gonna wanna go over his page time
and time again and extract every single word you can from it, reading
the archived versions of the page will help aswell. I&#x27;ve knocked off a
second on average on the trip down here just by seeing a sentence on
that page and having a different way of going about a step.

Mike Bennetts page is fun, too. It&#x27;s worth reading his algs.

Fast times with this method are entirly possable, as i&#x27;ve acheived a
sub-20 average with it in under a year of cubing. probibly from about
4 - 5 months of roux.

Don&#x27;t worry about being at a minate right now, I went up to about 1:20
from 30 seconds (when i used petrus), and i belive Gilles went from
under 20 to about 1:30 or something. Low times are entirly possable
with this method, and apparently possable for sub-20&#x27;s with a two look
corners.

You should learn a lot of tricks and shortcuts, here are the ones I use;

CMLL
ELL
Apply the concept of multislotting, not using anything solidly learnt
opposite block building (being able to choose to start on a white or a
yellow block)
inverted block building (being able to build those two sets of blocks
upside-down)
non-matching blocks (being able to build different blocks form each other)
NMCMLL (solve teh top corners in one look when non-matching blocks are
applyed - the big table under CMLL - about 30% done)
simultaneous block building (looking after a corner edge while you
build the first block)
AWOL centres in the LSE (rare)
Placing UF + UB instead of UL and UR (rare)

This along with hundereds of special configurations during the second
block that you&#x27;ll find out yourself gave me a sub-20 average, but I
don&#x27;t advise using pretty much any of it, you should keep it simple
untli you get to about 18, as I&#x27;m trying to use all thses at teh same
time while working on my speed and it&#x27;s given me slower overall
progress. But, the final result will be muuch faster.

That&#x27;s all the juice I have for now :)

It sounds like you essentially want to have a separate &quot;World&quot; 
Division/Competition that runs in parallel with the US Championships.

A question would be: do the top 24/16/8 overall competitors advance 
to the next round, or do the top 24/16/8 US competitors advance 
along with the top 24/16/8 &quot;World&quot; competitors?

I think it&#x27;s a nice model, that of having a World Division along 
with the US division (&quot;this is a friendly sport, all nations are 
welcome in the world of competitive speedcubing&quot;). I&#x27;d just suggest 
working out the details ahead of time and making them public, both 
to competitors and to the media.

Awesome job, Tyson! Maybe you can make a career out of competitive 
speedcubing. Heck, Bob Fox makes a living from competitive cup 
stacking.

          <div class="email-content">Tyson --

First of all: You Are Amazing! Pulling off a Nationals at the Palms 
in Vegas (along with all the tournaments you&#x27;ve helped organized 
before this) I think earns you some serious write-in votes for Most 
Influential Cuber. I know the tournaments are why I got back into 
cubing and have stayed involved.

Second: I looked back through some competitions in the past. SF 2006 
was the largest US competition (56 people in 3x), but at Worlds 
there were about 150 people in 3x, 100 of whom were listed as from 
the US. 100 at Vegas might be a stretch, but let&#x27;s go for it!

Third: Eating competitions and Worlds Strongest Person only have 8-
12 competitors, and they&#x27;re popular.

Fourth: Maybe it&#x27;s time to try to get ESPN2 involved? Anyone have 
any contacts? (perhaps the folks who ran Worlds2005 could help, 
since it was at a Disney park and CapCities owns Disney and ESPN2).

Great work, Tyson. If Palms happens, let&#x27;s all try to make it a 
great competition.

          <div class="email-content">The method is fantastic.  It&#x27;s nice that it averages fewer moves, and for<br>
someone who enjoys slice moves, it can&#x27;t be beat.  If you don&#x27;t like them<br>
now, try Roux for a month.  You&#x27;ll be hooked.  M&#x27;U is so fast it&#x27;s scary.<br>
<br>
There are lots of things you can do with this method to improve.  His page<br>
and method are great, but the beginner/intermediate step 4 on the archived<br>
page will be easier to pick up.  Using that, and CLL for corners, you can<br>
average sub 20.  I made it down to 19 for a while, but I had some extra<br>
tricks thrown in.  Your mileage may vary.<br>
<br>
The real secret is to practice.  But if you find that you like the idea<br>
behind the method, or you&#x27;re seeing good results, steady practice will<br>
multiply the good results many times over.<br>
<br>
So, go slow, and get the method down as good as you can.  Don&#x27;t worry about<br>
times.  Eventually, with enough practice, the decisions (what take up the<br>
time) will become almost instant.  The small decisions in this method are<br>
fantastic for that.<br>
<br>
So practice, and kick some butt.  Good luck, and happy cubing.<br>

Okay. When learning just a few of the algorithms, do you train them
&quot;back and forth&quot;, i.e. doing them and then doing their reverse and so
on? Or is that a bad way to practice? Should I just cube along and if
one of the cases I&#x27;m training comes up, I&#x27;ll do the algorithm, and if
it&#x27;s another case I&#x27;ll solve it using my old layer-by-layer method?
This is what I&#x27;m doing now.

I&#x27;m in Sweden, and I had plans to go to the Swedish Championships last
week, to meet some other cubers for the first time, but I&#x27;d forgot
that I was booked up that weekend. I&#x27;ll be going to Chalmers Open
though, also here in Sweden.

Yea, pretty often I can do that, or I can resort to doing what I did
using the layer-by-layer method, though that doesn&#x27;t really count, as
the side is not layed down simultaneously with the corner :)

Thanks. Haven&#x27;t seen that wiki before. I&#x27;ll check it out.

>   I have been working on it for around a month now (or so?) and am really just now starting to understand how to do it well, and my times are finally decreasing a lot from where they were when I used layer-by-layer method.

Okay. I think that I&#x27;m at a stage now where when I&#x27;m solving using the
few F2L algos that I&#x27;ve got in my head, I&#x27;m about the same when it
comes to speed as with the old LBL method. This is only due to some
inspection overhead, which I&#x27;m hoping to get rid of real soon :)

>   I also have a sheet with the 41 algs, and they help a LOT to show you how to do it efficiently. Once you get the basics down of intuitive F2L, start using the alg sheet and understanding how it works.

Yea. At first I had the sheet nearby, and successively corrected how I
was doing things, but maybe it&#x27;s better to let the intuitive F2L sink
in a bit, then match it with the &quot;optimal&quot; F2L.

Thanks a lot for your advice.

I don&#x27;t really get it, particularly I wonder why use r instead of Rr. 
Can you give a concrete example algorithm?

          <div class="email-content">definitely practice just the algs you&#x27;re working on over and over, 
and their reverses (and the inverse and its reverse if applicable).  
often the reverse, or set up moves, is an alg you&#x27;re going to want 
to know anyway, esp. in OLL and PLL, though sometimes they can 
differ from what you&#x27;ll do with the other case.  i.e., when I&#x27;m 
practicing some new OLL algs, start with solved cube, do an OLL alg 
you know and you&#x27;re left with a different OLL case (call it the 
first OLL&#x27;s pair).  you can do those moves in reverse order to get 
back to solved and again to set up the OLL case you know, or if you 
know a different OLL alg for the pair, just do that alg 2x, then the 
first one&#x27;s alg 2x and you can get some good practice on just those 
algs.  

also helpful for me was to not even look at the cube (hold it under 
your desk), and see how fast you can do the algs over and over again 
several times, then look at the cube at the end to make sure you did 
it right.

I know I&#x27;m not alone in saying I find it helpful to sometimes just 
focus on F2L algs over and over again (and later OLL, PLL, etc.).  
and then put it all together for some solves.

good luck

I use the same method as Gunnar (except that I hold the white centers
on the right face after building the white and yellow centers). If I
am in shape I can do sub-14 avg for the centers. During the centers I
also try to look ahead, so that I can make my next step so easy as
possible. But my weak point is that I can&#x27;t start with every color, I
can only start with white or yellow.

I just realized that. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to practice with both to keep me
fast on either of them until the day when I start to worry about
Fridrich OLL/PLL (just using a couple of simple algos at the moment).

That&#x27;s a great idea! Come to think of it, I think I sometimes trained
OLL/PLL algos that I actually know that way, back when I first learned
them. They&#x27;re only a few so far though, trying to focus on F2L.

I&#x27;ll try it out.

Yes, I&#x27;m not doing any LL at the moment, just a few solves here and
there for good spirit :)

Is it really luck? hehe :)

<br>
The poll has been closed and the results final.  Ron van Bruchem has <br>
been voted the most influential cuber.<br>

In retrospect, I feel I should not have ran this poll.  It demeans the <br>
ideal that I emphasized the most; All cubers who have influenced one <br>
other, or influenced many, have achieved a great thing.  <br>
<br>
The original intent of this effort will still be maintained and I will <br>
give another update in the next few days.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Indeed, I am very happy that so many kids are lured to cubing. I was amazed today when I was browsing the youngest to solve 3*3*3 cube page in www.speedcubing.com. Thanks to some nice and wonderful cubers like Stefan, Ron, Chris Hradwick, Bob Burton, Dan Harris, Joel  et al for influencing cubing among the kids. It is good for the cubing sport and also for its future.<br>
  However, when I view it from other angle, as a teacher, parent and memory trainer, are the kids enjoying it ? are they taking it as fun ? or are they forced by their parents/teachers ? I think we have to wait and only time will answer this question. How many are going to sustain or stick ?<br>
  As far as Bernett is concerned, he is enjoying it till this moment. It is fun for him. But, I have my own doubt how long he is going to sustain it ? I am doing my best to keep himmotivated. Thanks to Stefan Poachmann for guiding him in such a way since beginning. (Although, he was over ambitious last year for blindsolving, he realised his mistake and corrected it). After meeting Ron, his interest is multiplied. Let us hope, like Bernett every kid is enjoying cubing.<br>
   <br>
  I remember, someone from Japan pointed out to have a seperate cubing event for kids in RWC-2005 ?  Chess have U-8, U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, U-25 categories. Even memory sports have junior category. The number of memory athletes in this world are negligible when compared to number of cubers/cubists.<br>
   <br>
  I like to know how the other people in this group think about very young  kids taking cubing as a hobby or sport. How is the world cube organisation going to keep them motivated ? We all know, priority changes for kids very often. <br>
  Kudos to all young kids, their parents (and trainers if any).      <br>

friends who are speedcubers. We all plan to cube for the rest of our <br>

fact, my parents could not care less. I tried teaching my dad how to <br>
solve the magic and he had no patience for it. Anyways, on my and many <br>

  That is why, I feel you can lure more kids to this sport by having age wise category, like in chess. In future we can expect many more Anssis&#x27; and Mackys&#x27;. 
   
  >the best cuber in the world isn&#x27;t an experienced veteran who&#x27;s played the game for 20 years.
  A veteran need not be the best cuber in the world. A newbie need not be in the botom of the ranking list. It all depends on their commitment, practice and updating themselves with the latest techniques you veteran show them. 
  Just my thoughts.

  The championships are not only just finding the best and crowning him/her, but also should influence and motivate others.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with John here. I still remember, a couple of years a 7 year
old boy came to our chessclub, I was 13 then. I already played several
years and was kind of one of the better players at my club. After 1
year the boy was almost as good as I was. He went to the Dutch
Championships of his age, he finished 2nd (after 1 year playing
chess!). Now, he doesn&#x27;t play chess anymore because he doesn&#x27;t like
being pushed.
I don&#x27;t say that we should leave those talented young boys alone,
carefull we don&#x27;t push them, support is always a good thing. Age is
irrelevant indeed in cubing, aswell as the time you&#x27;ve been cubing.
(which is different in chess, because still it takes a supertalented
boy a couple of years to get all knowledge). Youngsters are often even
better than the veterans, in cubing it is the same I think. How older
you get, the more stiff your fingers get (I think).

As for the average, I trust Gilles and belive it&#x27;s real, but as for

only the official ones give a complete idea of how good people are.

I disagree, people can do worse in competitions ;)

I belive the best method is video, but even that can&#x27;t be trusted.

You could make them into a torrent. Those don&#x27;t require anymore than

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I suggested age category a while ago and am exploring how should we <br>
set. <br>
<br>
&gt;The problem I feel with having age divisions, like in chess, is <br>
that <br>
&gt;cubing is not something that takes many years to mature.  In other <br>
&gt;words, the best cuber in the world isn&#x27;t an experienced veteran <br>
who&#x27;s <br>
&gt;played the game for 20 years.  People like Anssi and Macky are just <br>
&gt;kids...<br>
#1 Learing periods<br>
Tyson is partly right. <br>
For teenagers, it may be easy to achieve world class speed in short <br>
term. <br>
Yes, this is one of good things in cubing. <br>
<br>
But it isn&#x27;t true for all the people. <br>
Anssi and Macky are great kids. <br>
However, even Macky took 4 years to achieve first sub20 average <br>
accoring to unofficial records. <br>
I think 4 year is not short for kids. <br>
Macky quickly stretched his records after he participated in wc2003. <br>
He must be motivated by participating in wc2003. <br>
<br>
#2 Cubing and Chess<br>
And I think cubing requires more physical ability than chess. <br>
That&#x27;s why all the cubers at final of wc2005 was under30 except Jon. <br>
<br>
#3 Some rewards for kids<br>
It is great thing for kids to participate in the same competition <br>
with the world champion. <br>
But they should be more motivated for speed if he could be rewarded. <br>
<br>
<br>
#4 Future of cubing community<br>
And I am not sure how long I can contribute for cubing community. <br>
I don&#x27;t know how long Ron, Tyson, and Gilles can do as same as for <br>
now. <br>
Someone may take over those role but we should set age categories, <br>
and lure more kids to cube and seed for future. <br>
<br>
#5 Difference in each country and area<br>
I don&#x27;t understand why U-18 was raised for discussion. <br>
I feel the situation is different between California and the other <br>
region. <br>
Obviously, there is Caltech Cube Club and I believe there are many <br>
high school and university students in California. <br>
In case of Japan, there are not many student cubers, unfortunately, <br>
although we wished for someone to establish cube clubs in <br>
universities and high schools. <br>
Instead, many Japanese kids are started cubing and listed on <br>
unofficial youngest solvers. <br>
Those kids are encouraged to cube by seeing their name on unofficial <br>
list. <br>
<br>
Think that we started unofficial record lists, could not be <br>
satisfied with it, and finally established official lists. <br>
They should want to have that kinds. <br>
<br>
<br>
#6 My suggestion is following. <br>
###1 12 and under 12<br>
To my knowledge, those kids go to elementary school. A few kids may <br>
go to junior high. <br>
But the start of school year is different in each country, <br>
categorizing by age must be better. <br>
<br>
###2 10 and under 10<br>
To our experience, there are a few very fast (20-30 sec) kids at 12 <br>
year-old. <br>
Since most of those kids solve in 1-3 min, this may be good to to <br>
motivate relatively slow kids. <br>
<br>
<br>
Masayuki<br>
<br>
P.S. <br>
Please consider senior group there are several cubers more than 70-<br>
year-old in Japan. <br>
And I am 40 now. <br>

Right, physical ability is the only thing that differs. It&#x27;s not like 
youngsters have way more spare time to practice.

The chess gamer look for the best move my explanation is easy and 
real no ?  Only to realize that nobody controls it completely the 
fewest move on the smallest or 2x2x2, it&#x27;s magic. 

My average of 3 consecutive game on swedish club on the web is 
11,9,9.
 
I presume for this club, the best cuber is the fastest physical 
ability, time reaction, memorisation, not for me. 
I pushed the limit of cartesian on tv show with my cube 3x3x3=27. 
open your spririt. My contribution is inspiration + frustration. I&#x27;m 
the first behind his back on tv or this web is not important I don&#x27;t 
know anyway my game look super fast. I was not declared normal I was 
the first. 
I was a sun direct on dead zone time. 
My friend inventor 5x5x5 in 1981, patent, paper and machine is 
++$10000. 100 % aluminium smooth and stable. 
On ne cherche pas des sponsors et personne nous a offert un billet 
d&#x27;avion.
This communauty look for egotrip only sorry innocent maybe and I 
wish.

&quot;I studied variations of a 2x2x2 cube. I was immediately struck by 
the wealth that could be sensed only from this start &quot; (Erno Rubik).

M. Rubik had only an intuition that there must be a method. He 
started out by aligning the eight corner cubies correctly on the 
rubik&#x27;s cube 3x3x3&quot;.

My primate picture on Toronto on this web is a curious hazard only 
for you

This world is English universal language or podium. I&#x27;m better now 
maybe:)

Where is the cube 99 x 99 x 99 anyway the number of corner on this 
imaginary cube is 8 too. 

The news paper or the spectator is a neophyte he look the fast hand 
only. The 2x2x2 is not the puzzle for me because never cube exist 
without him. 

I like Sergio Leone use the serious and humor. This life is fragile 
and important. The 2x2x2 look easy too. 

Many webmaster or cuber is very poor with my link and my show is 
special.. I&#x27;m a cartesian of cube me too. Anyway who is the better 
u, me or him, is my perception and the 3x3x3 is only a cube for the 
beast on thescene but the 2x2x2 is the son of god, do you see god 
cube ? I like the stairway to heaven version of Frank Zappa song. 

GG 

PS: The 99 is not the fast on the ice but he is fast with the puck. 
My best visitor is the young Uwe Wong.

          <div class="email-content">The fancifle 3x3x3 sticker is indeed a 3x3x3 = 27, but sometimes in my 
inspiration, I solve +1 to be dominant 28 denomination.  The spirit 
transcends the PVC, and the class-1 Lever of the metatarsals used to 
manipulate said item becomes credit card plastic.  Blindfold it is 
must, and D2 R2 is reverse of Starwars droid, so it must be magic.

But then we consider, with intrepid imagination, the journey to the 
dead zone called sun, where SPF protection orders of magnitude greater 
than 3x3x3 is not 27, but is far higher, so we look at 5x5x5, the 
inventor who died trying to +1 to 126.  Sun is main sequence dwarf, and 
8 corners Mr. Rubik aligned, and realized Yoda grammar is not funny, 
but the cube he solved.

Though our webskills decline, not everyone has privilege of cartesian 
design.  My website is in cylindrical, and my friends use polar.  
Convert formats and coordinates by paying Russian college math students 
we must, but even so, the best average for the Moldovan club still 
exceeds 8 seconds, and 8 is 2x2x2.  Magic?  No?  Yes... maybe.  
Probably, maybe, will you go to prom with me?

If 2x2x2 is the son of god, then 3x3x3 is the incarnation of god, and 
humans transcend the ultimate deity in our sport by aligning the pretty 
colors, which look so pretty, how ever pretty, when one takes acid.

But solve cube alfresco with redivivus chagrin and sometimes gaucherie 
panache.  I sit on toilet and have lots of logorrhea, sometimes smells 
very assiduous, but brown sylvan eats my magic, and food voluptuary 
tickles inure organ.  I have fun!  Because sometimes, control is 
auspicious, and if English is the universal language, then tmesis is 
the solution, carapace can be used to protect us because Leroy Jenkins 
is paladin and hales and needs sacrosanct melange of sword to find 
vainglory.  Stupid!  Nonsense, and hogwash!  But arctic tundra finds 
sub rosa digerati and confrere is NOT A NEOPHYTE becomes querulous and 
vociferous with cube, we find pot full of boiling water and cook our 
own brother, but find ourselves thrown into a firmament because The 
Bible was real, and flackja can jollification and find benefaction and 
good feelings, without orgasm, apposite from cynosure and quiddity, but 
the perquisite, is to eat Hogmanay.

But the toilet also has room for 
http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2005/12/.

All right, what&#x27;s the point of all of this?  The message is hardly 
intelligible, but if you&#x27;re trying to prove something, that you&#x27;re the 
fastest in the world, or that you&#x27;re the father of blindfolding, or 
that you&#x27;re the best blindfold cuber in the world, I welcome you to our 
competition, where I will eagerly await the challenge of setting a 
blindfold time less than half of yours.

I solved one in 1:20 last night.  Let&#x27;s go.

One possibility is that we could change the format a little bit.  <br>

How do you use the NMCMLL table?  I looked at it last night and I <br>
understand that it&#x27;s showing you what the top and sides are going to <br>
look like for the corners but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to do with <br>
it.  I hope you know what I&#x27;m trying to say because I don&#x27;t completely <br>
know myself.<br>
<br>
Why would someone build non-matching blocks?  Would you just do it at <br>
times where you find that there is a corner edge pair that isn&#x27;t really <br>
what you are looking for?  What about building the 2nd block on top, <br>
how would you move that to the side and how would you solve it from <br>
there?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Roger,

I solve with the extended cross very frequently actually, especially 
after picking up Richard Patter&#x27;s dual solving idea, where I solve 
either white or yellow cross each time.

I did a 100 average one time counting the number of moves for 
different steps of my solve and found that 28/100 or 28% of those 
solves were extended style cross solves.  One of those solves was a 
double extended cross, or 1% of the total.  I did all solves solving 
only with a white cross, so without dual solving.

With dual solving ideally I should solve an extended cross 1-(1-0.28)
^2=48.16% of the time.

Also with a 1% double extended corss percentage on one color I 
should ideally do a double extended cross 1-(1-0.01)^2=1.99% of the 
time.

I would say that those numbers feel about right for me, I end up 
doing some sort of Xcross type solve roughly half the time now and I 
occasionaly get a double Xcross as well.

I average about 9-10 seconds for the F2L, but the really good guys 
average 8 seconds.  Without using Xcross and dual solving (always 
choosing the better setup color between white and yellow as my 
cross) there is no way I could average sub-10 seconds.  Just solving 
the same color every time and not doing Xcross I consistently 
average 12-13 seconds for F2L.

But again there are people who don&#x27;t do Xcross often or use dual 
solving who average very fast, maybe even some of the 8 second 
people solve that way.

So in short I don&#x27;t know what to say other than to find a strategy 
that works best for you.  There&#x27;s no way I can average under even 11 
seconds without using Xcross or dual solving (and I&#x27;ve tried for 
years!) but with both Xcross and dual solving I can often get to 9 
seconds average for F2L.

It&#x27;s all about finding what works for you, if Xcross works for you 
stick with it, if it just slows you down then scrap it and try 
something else.

Personally I swear by the combination of using Xcross and dual 
solving together, and I won&#x27;t ever switch back to a more &quot;regular&quot; 
approach.

Hope that helps,
Chris

For his table, you use the side column to see which corners need to flip.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the reply, Chris.

I&#x27;m nowhere near as fast in my F2L yet (average about 40 secs), but 
I guess I&#x27;ve been thinking about strategies to decrease moves so if 
I can pick up some &quot;good&quot; habits now, the strategies will pay off in 
decreased time in the end.

It seems like most F2L algs involve 7-8 moves (except for the very 
few simple cases).  With extended cross, one might be able to save 4-
5 moves on average.  Have you done any averages using moves to 
extended cross vs. cross and optimal first pair?

Later,

Roger Wood

          <div class="email-content">He&#x27;s talking about the NMCMLL table, not the CMLL one :)<br>
<br>
My method for the corners when using non-matching blocks has changed<br>
and is much better now. I can pretty much solve them in one move.<br>
<br>
Lets do a non-matching solve.<br>
<br>
Green on top, orange on front.<br>
<br>
F2 L&#x27; R2 U2 D R&#x27; F R&#x27; F2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; F B&#x27; R U2 B D2 L2 R U2 R2 D U&#x27; F2<br>
<br>
Now, on the left I see the block i normally would create and solve.<br>
But! on the right is pretty much all of another block. Problem is,<br>
it&#x27;s the upside-down version of one of the regular blocks we use. (At<br>
this point, I&#x27;d like to mention that if you always start on one block,<br>
you&#x27;re limiting your times a lot. You should definatly use an L and R<br>
block, and if you&#x27;re brave, expand to the 4 that I use - L, R, Upside<br>
down L, upside down R. This is one of the big advantages to<br>
non-matching blocks - loads of cases to take advantages of. This is<br>
also a big help in the second block) this block will be built and<br>
we&#x27;ll try to preserve the other blockso we can built that much quicker<br>
than normal aswell.<br>
<br>
F&#x27;M2FU&#x27;R&#x27;Uxy2<br>
<br>
First block done, now we create the second one, but upside down.<br>
Another cool thing is that I imagine blue and green as the top and<br>
bottom colours, and because you see them as a group in step 4 anyway,<br>
it&#x27;s easy to see them as one now. The four blocks all look teh same to me.<br>
<br>
Ur&#x27;U&#x27;RUMU&#x27;rU&#x27;R&#x27;<br>
<br>
And you have your two blocks!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s important to note at this stage that we orientated centres<br>
aswell, as they pretty much cost nothing to do.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the corners....<br>
<br>
Ok, it&#x27;s a sune case and one that I don&#x27;t know the quick colour<br>
combinations of. I&#x27;ve been trying to learn all teh ways the patterns<br>
come up in different block combinations. This is one i don&#x27;t know, if<br>
I did I&#x27;d be executing the alg :) so lets fall back into failsafe mode.<br>
<br>
You can see the two corners nearest to you need swapping, as the top<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I&#x27;m working a lot on my 4x4x4 edges method too.

The idea was to find an alg for each lenght of cycle with the same
start position.

I set up the first pair, the second, the third ect... until the 10th
always by the same way, but I use the appropriate alg if the cycle is
shorter than 10.
I try to calculate the parity during this step.
In average, it leaves 3 or 4 pairs unsolved then I fix them and parity
with the appropriate alg.

Here&#x27;s the website : frederickbadie.free.fr , I wrote it quickly.

Any comments are welcome.

Frederick.

          <div class="email-content">I would prefer Tyson&#x27;s idea of giving another round to those who don&#x27;t
advance to the second round rather than creating a separate division.
 Most people would try to qualify for the second round rather than win
among those that didn&#x27;t qualify.

If we really want a separate division, it should be based on official
records alone. Once WCA website can do things like calculate all-time
competition average for each cuber, it&#x27;ll be easy to create separate
divisions by setting appropriate promotion/relegation stats. Of
course, the problem then is how to deal with really fast cubers that
compete for the first time.

I mean that if you&#x27;re asking for a fast method, you want evidence of
how fast it is, how consistent it can be, with solves timed
officially, compared to cubes solved with other methods in the same
conditions.
But you&#x27;re right, my best average isn&#x27;t 13.88s. (*)

Gilles.

(*) It now is 13.44s :-)

improved a lot since their previous competition.  I would hate to be 
stuck competing in the wrong division based only my previous &quot;track

to the &quot;real&quot; final round if you are capable of it (regardless of 
track record).

In practice, these type of mini-competitions between cubers of 
similar skill spring up informally at every competition I&#x27;ve 
attended.  So why not just organize them, since that&#x27;s what we 
obviously enjoy?  Of course it might take more judges to make it 
actually happen.

For a few minutes, I tried to read your mind to find out what alg 
you&#x27;re using. I failed, I don&#x27;t feel strong enough right now.

This one was 4.27 seconds (not counting the start/end rotation):

For a few minutes, I tried to read your mind to find out what alg 
you&#x27;re using. I failed, I don&#x27;t feel strong enough right now.

This one was 4.27 seconds (not counting the start/end rotation):

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I believe Ron is doing a double fix for the orientation parity. This 
means his fix is actually fixing both tha orientation and 
permutation parities. This is what he has done in the past anyway. 
Since the chance of permutation parity is 50/50 this is still not 
bad. Especially if this double-fix is faster to perform than the 
sole orientation parity fix. And anyway, u can ask Ron which alg he 
was actually showing u.

I assume that the permutation parity can be fixed in about 1.5 to 
2.0 secs. It can be done either as :

r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 (Chris Hardwick)

or

(Rr)2 (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2 (Stefan Pochmann)

In any case it should be productive to recognize whether one/both or 
none of the parities occur ;-) If both do actually occur then do a 
double fix alg directly :D Being able to see this should be more 
productive than being able to eliminate the orientation parity when 
pairing up the edges :-)

Have fun!

-Per

PS! For my cage method there is actually only 1 parity anyway. So 
what do i care? ;-)

Yes as u can see i&#x27;m more focused on the 5x5x5 than the 4x4x4 ;-) I 
like the slow 5x5x5 version cause it&#x27;s kinder to the centers. And it

Hmm, I&#x27;ll work on that for a few days and see what I get out of it.  
What kind of non-matching blocks should I do?  Do you (once you 
complete the left block) just all of a sudden think &quot;I think I&#x27;ll do 
one upside down this time&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m going to do a sideways one&quot;?

basically, after the first block I go into solving the normal next
block. But if I see a pair of something else or an easyer NM block,
and I&#x27;m feeling especially reckless, I&#x27;ll do that.

Oh, I only build upside-down blocks. Sideways is a little too

I categorised the OLL-algorithms according their algorithm - 
structure:

I didn&#x27;t really do this while I was learning it, but people that 
learn OLL from my page say it&#x27;s useful.

I would like to give kids a chance to set world official records and <br>

For fastest, it should be easy. We only need the inforamtion of <br>
their age. <br>
For average, they may not qualifiy for semifinal and final. <br>
In case, we need to set another round for them based on their 1st <br>

<br>
Shall we start official 3x3x3 fastest list for U12 in 2006? <br>
If we see a lot of kids cubers on the list, we may need to think <br>
something like another round in 2007. <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;d like to know your approach, lol. When I solve a 5x5x5 I solve 
the centers intuitively (and usually end up doing a lot of BS 
switching on the last two centers until it works), pair up wings and 
edges (although I do it in a long way) in an intuitive fashion, and 
solve as a big 3x3x3. But it takes me forever to solve this thing 
this way.

Try to eliminate wasteful moves during F2L (including cross).  [This 
currently takes me about 40 turns on average using WC, and less if I 
go slowly.]  Practice very slowly indeed -- think of minimizing the 
moves as a puzzle in itself: makes it more interesting.  Try to 
remember how you dealt with the &quot;awkward&quot; cases, especially when they 
are cases that come up frequently.

When solving the F2L, keep an eye open for a likely next piece to 
solve.  This is much easier for WC than with Fridrich, as you only 
have to find one candidate piece!

For the last layer, investigate a 3-look method.  These don&#x27;t take 
too much learning and probably average under 30 turns for the LL.

i agree with joel.  i&#x27;ve recently learnt most (well, ok 45 or so)
olls.  thanks to joel&#x27;s excellent resource i minted through them in
about a month.  

the only problem i have is that i&#x27;ve learnt all of the &#x27;easy ones&#x27;,
for example, the sune variants and am now struggling to find the
motivation to learn the not so nice ones.

dan harris also has a great oll resource
(http://www.cubestation.co.uk/) and recommends a different order
starting with horrible ones precisely, i suspect, for the reason i now
don&#x27;t know them all :-).  however, for me, 57 algs looked like a bit
of a learning burden so i wanted to get off to a flying start.

i have &#x27;summarised&#x27; and re-grouped joel&#x27;s olls a bit into a
spreadsheet. if you&#x27;re interested i can email it.

cheers and good luck

his page in 3 weeks with 1 hour practice per day).

Also, I recommend using another resource such as Dan Harris&#x27; website
to repeat the algorithms and store them in your long term memory.

Then a lot of practice is needed to put them in your &quot;reflex zone&quot;.

Good luck with that,

Thats great to hear. Just admit it, it&#x27;s cool to brag about your 
results... :D. You worked hard for it, so it&#x27;s just cool if you 
share your good results.

I&#x27;ve been working on the larger cubes myself lately... If I ever 
need help, I&#x27;ll let you know.

- Joël.

I am also interested in that, actually! If you think it need some

Could you mail that spreadsheet to jnoort [at] gmail [dot] com?

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Joel... very nice page.  Since I&#x27;ve already learned the corners-only
and edges-only algorithms, learning the rest by their similarity to the ones
I already know is probably a much better way than naming them.  I picked up
5 or 6 more really quickly last night!

My feeling is that it&#x27;s impossible.

I think the point would be to build interest in speedcubing by 
providing a couple more avenues for younger or older competitors (or 
for &quot;newbies&quot;) to get some recognition when competing against 
the &quot;professionals&quot;.

Here&#x27;s three models I can think of, leveraged from other competitions:

- Age Grouping. This is often done in athletic competitions (swimming, 
running, etc). Everyone runs the same race and there is an overall 
winner, but also there is recognition for Under-12, Under-18, 18-25, 
25-35, etc.

For cubing, you have the one standard competition but at the end, 
recognize the top 12-and-under, the best 40-and-over, and any other 
age categories. So, a John Louis might be 22nd, but the top 12-and-
under. And I can dream of one day beating Lars in the 40-and-over.


- Competition Result Grouping. This is done in crossword competitions. 
You are a rookie until you&#x27;re one of the top 4-8 rookies in a 
competition, then you move up to C division, then B division, etc (up 
to Open division). Everyone does the same competition, but recognition 
is done based on the divisions.

You can also self-place in divisions, if you are new but good and want 
a shot at being in a higher division. But once you self-place, you&#x27;re 
in that division for future competitions.

This requires tracking past competition results, which we have on 
speedcubing.com, but also requires having large enough competitions so 
that you aren&#x27;t in top 4-8 with a big time. Probably not as workable 
right now, except at the big competitions.


- Self-Grouping. This is how some european football leagues run. When 
you sign up, you put yourself in a division. If you place high enough 
in that division, you move up. Similar to Competition Result Grouping, 
but with self-placing.


Personally, I like the concept of adding a couple age divisions (Youth 
and Masters). But that could be because I&#x27;m now over 40! And if it 
makes the competitions more complicated, forget it - they&#x27;re already 
complicated enough as it is.

          <div class="email-content">The Rubik&#x27;s Cube is VERY easy to master and age has nothing to do with
a person&#x27;s ability to master it. It is not a physical sport and young
or old competitors do not have any disadvantage. I think having
separate divisions is not necessary. Those who dedicate more effort
towards mastering the cube will win, that&#x27;s how it should be!! There
is no reason to celebrate those who did not achieve top rankings
because they have an equal opportunity to reach those positions, if
they put in the effort.

I remember when I first started cubing, I was waaaaaaaay slower than
everyone else. I thought sub-20 was completely unattainable for me.
Knowing that I had to get to that point to be competitive was a
motivation and I got faster because of it. If we celebrate mediocrity,
then people will have no reason to practice!

The best cuber is the one who puts forth the more effort...and wins!
That&#x27;s how it should be.

Lol, the thing I regret the most for not doing when I when to the 
Caltech winter competition was not asking to feel/try out Frank&#x27;s 5x5. 
Oh, how I loath not doing that. (FYI Frank, I was the 13 year old 
hanging out with Bob and Clancy most of the time.)

Yes, it is possible. It already happened to me almost two moths ago.
These where the times: 

2:17.80 (1:53.35) 2:10.04 2:10.49 (2:44.40) 2:15.10 2:17.15 2:20.49

The average of 10 is 2:12.06. Try to find out a better average of 5 (7

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Lots of great ideas. But personally I do not understand which problem we are trying to solve.

It is already a great joy to be among other cubers! Competitions are like reunions.

For the bigger competitions we often have trophies for the youngest and oldest solver, or for the person travelling the longest distance to the competition.
We also keep track of the youngest (and soon when I find the time, also the oldest) solver in a competition for the WCA world records.
And we could also add a trophy for a special achievement, which could be for anything, including age, style, bad luck, being physically challenged or whatever.

Noone should be ashamed of his times. If you solve you are already among the top 2% (rough estimate) of the population.

In this case I prefer the Olympic slogan: participating is more important than winning. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m really for this non-puzzle-related categorisation
either. Obviously we need to categorise events based on different
puzzles, and different types of solving (e.g. regular speedsolving,
one-handed, BLD, etc.), but any categorisation other than this seems a
bit random to me. If we were going to categorise on age, then why not
gender? (No, I don&#x27;t think we should, I&#x27;m just using the gender example
to illustrate a point.) If it&#x27;s about encouraging other demographics to
get involved with cubing then I reckon there are far fewer females into
cubing than there are young kids!

Even though categorising based on gender would obviously work in my
favour, I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s needed. I&#x27;m happy to compete directly
against the guys (of any age!)

Also, age categorisation sounds like it&#x27;d be even *more* work for the
competition organisers who are just volunteers and have enough to do
already!

Ur question was not really what u wanted to ask i guess. U meant to 
ask if it&#x27;s possible that the best 7/5 average out of 12 consecutive 
solves is worse than the full 12/10 avg. And nope, that is not 
possible. It&#x27;s not too trivial to prove it rigorously but it&#x27;s 
intuitive nevertheless ;-) One would have to use something like the 
pigeonhole principle :-) Or arrive at a contradiction somehow ...

Cheers!

Your are not right. Stefan and I already give an counterexample. In
Stefan&#x27;s example: the 12/10 average is 1.95, while all the six 7/5
averages are 2.

That the best 5??? Hmmm...lemme calculate in my head...a minute
later.........Yah, that would be about 2:12.3x or 2:12.4x...its not
far off...but still...

What is the average age in the top 10 (15,20, whatever you want)...and

With this, the average of 12 (so removing th best and the worst) is 1.9
and the best of average of 5 (so removing the best and the worst out
of these 5 times) is always 2.0

So your example doesn&#x27;t prove that the best average of 5 can be worse
than the average of 12 ;-) (maybe my first question was not so clear)

Now I&#x27;m really confused. Are you saying 2.0 is not worse than 1.9? If 
for some reason you say better=larger then replace the 1&#x27;s by 3&#x27;s.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Frederick and Stefan and everyone,

I&#x27;ve been still working on this new pairing technique and I really 
do like it.  I think it will be faster, but I don&#x27;t have proof of 
that yet.

I&#x27;ve been working on doing some stop/start solves and I either get 
the edges right and really fast or I screw them up and get a slow 
time.

So take it as you will.  I did a stop start average stopping for 
centers/edges/3x3x3 to record the time.  The total is on the right.

15.16 23.62 24.02 = 62.80 no parities
14.31 20.66 28.03 = 63.00 both parities
14.18 31.75 32.25 = 78.18 OLL parity
14.69 24.92 23.00 = 62.61 no parities

Again the times are in the format centers/edges/3x3.

those times aren&#x27;t much evidence, but I&#x27;m getting fairly tired.  
I&#x27;ll try to do this some more.  It seems I either mess up my edges 
and get 1:20+ or I get them right and like just now I got a 63.87 
solve with both parities.  So my times are all over the place.

In short I hope it will be faster in the long run, but for now it is 
slower.  I want to try it anyway, since I think it is fun.

Now as to what I do, I either do d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; or u&#x27; R U R&#x27; u rather 
than always doing d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; type moves.  This seems like a really 
insignificant change, but it is more looking than I am used to, but 
I think it will be worth it.

Again it sounds like a small change, but I think it will speed me up 
personally.

Also, Frederick, I like your idea how is it working out for you?  I 
like the ability to just solve a significant groups of edges all 
together without having to do 2 pairing or 6 pairing the usual way.  
Does it seem like it will be faster, or is it faster for you already?

I think the 4x4 can really get to sub-60 but man it still seems like 
a long way away.  Heck, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s already been 
done but no one has posted it.

Just my ramblings in case anyone is interested.

Chris

Hi Gilles,
Yes, it is possible. It already happened to me almost two moths ago.
These where the times: 

2:17.80 (1:53.35) 2:10.04 2:10.49 (2:44.40) 2:15.10 2:17.15 2:20.49
2:07.47 2:08.84 2:12.41 2:00.79

The average of 10 is 2:12.06. Try to find out a better average of 5 (7
solves, discarding best and worst times) :).

Er... are you just worrying about the fact that the averages of 5 are 
all the same, so there is no single &quot;best&quot; average of 5?

If this is the problem, just add a little &quot;random noise&quot; to Stefan&#x27;s 
numbers:

1.089206578
2.055663178
2.052116335
2.081878728
2.051945906
2.068590858
2.007672076
2.034954337
2.043153836
2.020417679
2.054760135
1.031008413

Best average of 5/7 = 2.032191612
Average of 10/12 = 1.947848092

It&#x27;s a serious (and interesting!) point. ;)

For 12 times drawn from a given, fixed distribution (Gaussian, say), 
what is the probability that the best average of 5/7 is bigger than the 
average of 10/12?  I would have to answer this question by running a 
simulation...

Were you just saying that in 50 years the beginner methods will be

insane??? So beginners will take longer to learn?!?!  Whats the

you are drawing  strange conclusions from what I have said!  Chris is 22 now and telling us that cubing ability has nothing to do with age. HOw can he be so sure? That´s why I asked him (indirectly) to confirm his statement after half a century. (And what do you mean by &quot;young and old alike can learn at whatever pace they want to&quot;? If I understand you correctly (I often misunderstand things nowadays),  you yourself can - if you wish - get an average e.g. under ten sec.
So why not go ahead! I´m waiting with exitement.)

Rune,

Were you just saying that in 50 years the beginner methods will be
Fridrich and Petrus, and the advanced will be like...something
insane??? So beginners will take longer to learn?!?!  Whats the
difference between now and 50 years???(I know you are older than
us...but I think that young and old alike can learn at whatever pace
they want to)

It&#x27;s a serious (and interesting!) point. ;)

For 12 times drawn from a given, fixed distribution (Gaussian, say), 
what is the probability that the best average of 5/7 is bigger than the 
average of 10/12?  I would have to answer this question by running a 
simulation...

          <div class="email-content">No, I think he meant that some people learn more or less quickly, 
depending on motivation, free time, etc. but not necessarily age. For 
example, some people learn the full set of 21PLL in, say, 3 days, and it 
takes some people 2 weeks or longer, because either they don&#x27;t have much 
spare time or are bad at remembering things or just don&#x27;t practice 
enough or whatnot.
And while I&#x27;m at it, I might as well give my opinion. Unless you have a 
physical or technical excuse to not being fast, with more or less 
practice, just about anyone (at any age) can be fast at cubing. Fast 
being, sub-20 at least, and I do believe it&#x27;s quite easy with some 
motivation to get sub-15. But let&#x27;s say sub-20 is already considered as 
good. However, with getting older some problems start coming, like, I 
dunno, sight problems, your reflexes get slower, why not Parkinson while 
we are at it, but that&#x27;s something I consider as a technicality rather 
than an age issue. And as for any other sport, there will be the elite, 
for example the sub-15 guys (that&#x27;s not being that much of an elite 
nowadays...), but see, I don&#x27;t see why someone aged 13 would be starting 
off with an advantage on someone aged 45. On a lesser extent, take the 
current unofficial top-10. I don&#x27;t know everyone, but being French, I do 
know most of these guys (hehe... sorry.) The first 2 are around 20-21, 
then Macky (I&#x27;m not 100% sure so I wouldn&#x27;t want to upset him by telling 
a wrong age), Thibault Jacquinot (should be around 17), Nathan is 
somewhere near 20, the next 2 I have no idea, then take Gilles, he 
speedsolves cubes in lesser moves (STM, although... it might work in HTM 
too?) than his age (in years) on a daily basis and is still fast!
So my point is: cubing is one of those &quot;cool&quot; things. Many cubers cube 
because, yeah, it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s impressive and why not, it gets 
you chicks (although that&#x27;s not a proved fact). But for (many of, I 
don&#x27;t want to upset anyone, I&#x27;m just pretty sure a good part of) those 
aged 30+, cubing was &quot;cool&quot; in the 80es, and most likely they either 
picked up the habit since to just cube around or they put it aside for 
20 years and then found it in a corner of the house. But you won&#x27;t find 
a lot of new cubers aged 30 (although that&#x27;s still feasible), 40 or 50. 
Therefore, with less people with possibly less free time than High 
School kids, and other things to worry about, you get to a smaller pool 
of competitive people. Now, say you start of with 1000 kids in good 
physical shape (pool A) aged between 10 and 20 and 1000 random people in 
good physical shape (pool B) between 30 and 60, all of these 2000 people 
having the same motivation and same interest in cubing, now give each of 
these guys/girls a good cube and the same amount of free time, come 
back, say, one year later, do you really think the good people from pool 
A will be that much better than the good people from pool B? I think 
it&#x27;s all a matter of time you put into cubing rather than a matter of 
age. You can be good at whatever age you want if you don&#x27;t miss a thumb 
or an arm and if you practice enough. The only thing that really differs 
is probably the method of learning which can be fairly different between 
two people (not the solving method, I don&#x27;t care about it). I was 
probably a slow learner, and more than that, a lazy learner, the least 
algs I knew the better, took me one year to get under 20s. But many here 
get sub-16 in one year, and know a couple different methods plus 
blindfolded plus own about a dozen different cubes and are good at each 
one of them. I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t know the OLL, nor any fancy trick for 
solving the F2L, I just solve it routinely and that&#x27;s all I want. 
Different aims, different purposes.
That, or I&#x27;m completely off-topic and have been spaming everyone about a 
discussion I haven&#x27;t been completely following since its beginning. If 
that&#x27;s the case, just  ignore me. I&#x27;ve been writing for too long and I 
definitely had better things to do. Like, practicing what is going to 
not become my job it I keep being so lazy.

          <div class="email-content">There are many good website with newbie solutions, most of them are so
called layer-by-layer methods. Just google around a bit and you should
find something. I had never solved the cube 3 months ago, and now I&#x27;m
averaging around 60 seconds, and I&#x27;m not cubing that much, so I think
your aim at one year for just solving it is a bit low :)

Good luck!

I should have done this from the beginning : an excel sheet !


Times 
Best 1
1 1 
2 2 Worst 2
3 2 
4 2 
5 2 Average of 12 : 1,9
6 2 Average of 5 : 2
7 2 
8 2 
9 2 
10 2 
11 2 
12 1 

SI this proves that my first statement was wrong.
THank you very much everybody and excuse me for being stubborn :p

If you mean my question then yeah, sole reason was that I thought 
people would believe it&#x27;s not possible for the shorter average to be 
worse.

OK, I did the simulation for Gaussian- and uniformly-distributed 
random numbers, using 10,000,000 trials each time.  The probability 
that the best average of 5/7 is greater than the average of 10/12 
comes out as   

Gaussian: 0.05550 +/- 0.00007
Uniform:  0.05467 +/- 0.00007

Surprising (maybe) that the results are so similar for the two 
distributions -- about 5.5% in each case.

It´s always pleasant to find someone to agree with. If we now change the above conditions a little so that the participants in pool A are in the ages 20-30 and we are no longer talking about cubers but sprinters, Francois would say: &quot;Oh, it´s not the same!&quot;  It *is* the same. The muscles in the fingers are fundamentally the same as in the legs, like the nerves (and the brain) behind. They are all subject of aging (which begins at birth). The difference is that the deterioration in the fingers goes so slow that we notice it relatively late.
Just a remark.Gilles and I may be the only ones that solve the cube in lesser moves than our ages respectively show, but His method must be exceptional.

with my cube. Your time in a year is totally dependent on how long you
want to spend cubing every day. I started(I think) on January 28th of
this year and am currently averaging in the low 30&#x27;s. I spend at least
two hours cubing every day. I have a friend who started a week after I
did, and still goes above 2 minutes because he only cubes every couple
of days. So be persistant and have fun!

          <div class="email-content">For F2L, I developed my own method that involves inserting a corner
sideways(for instance, if you&#x27;re solving the FR corner-edge pair, put
the corner in so the D color faces right. Then, with the middle layer
edge in the last layer, you can either turn the corner up to meet the
edge with a simple R turn, or, if the edge is upside down when you do
that, place it in the UR position and do [RUR&#x27;U&#x27;]x2. This way, you
only need to practice FRF&#x27;R&#x27; for insertion of a correctly aligned pair
or RUR&#x27;U&#x27; for a malaligned pair.
On my LL, I know all of the algorithms for when the edges are oriented
correctly, so I use combos of FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; to orient the edges, then
execute an OLL. From there I just use a Fridrich PLL to solve it.

If you don&#x27;t like all of the sequences listed on that site, then try 
from the 16 links at the bottom of the page.  You&#x27;ll find ones that 
you like :)

For a typical 2-look LL you need 57 orientation (OLL) and 21 
permutation (PLL) algorithms.  Generally, 3-look LL is orient edges (3 
algs), orient corners (7 algs), and then PLL (21).  Try different 
sites; mix and match to make your own list of algorithms.  Also, start 
with a 4-look LL and build up to a 2--don&#x27;t dive right into OLL and 
expect to learn it easily.

Hope this helps,

The 3x3x3, without a doubt.  It&#x27;s the classic cube that started it all. 
Definitely my favorite by far.

          <div class="email-content">Any site has LL algs. If you want a 2LLL, learn all of the algorithms on one of these sites... 78 algs in all.
   
  For a 3LLL, you simply learn the algs which orient only edges, th ose which orient only corners, and you learn all the permutation algs.
   
  http://www.cubewhiz.com/pll.html learn all 21 cases for a 3LLL or 2LLL
  http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html learn the first 10 cases for a 3LLL
   
   
  I dont think I&#x27;ll ever even try to learn a full 2LLL. I am just finishing learning a full 3LLL and from what I&#x27;ve heard, that is good enough to average sub-20, and I dont plan on ever geting that good even,... so ya. 

  I learned a 4LLL first. I am able to average around a minute with a 4LLL, so maybe do that first if you haven&#x27;t yet... but maybe i&#x27;m making an ass of myself, and you can already average better than a minute.. hehe 
   
  (for a 4LLL, you learn only the first 7 of the algs on the PLL page)
   
  good luck

          <div class="email-content">Hello Mike.

For your method, it should always have no more than 4 moves per 
corner, and the edge is 6-7 moves, so you end up with 38 moves after 
the cross on average just for the first two layers. Now, a normal 
LBL method would use only a couple more. Do you use any of the other 
easy ones like when the edge is already inserted correctly and the 
easy connected pair ones? Because I really don&#x27;t see too much of an 
advantage with this method.

5x5x5. I figured it out all by myself, that&#x27;s why I like it. :) Bleh, 
if all Rubik&#x27;s puzzles allowed, it&#x27;d have to be Magic or Megaminx.

If you&#x27;re doing Fridrich&#x27;s method, 56 moves is average according to 
her page
(http://tinyurl.com/mwcb)
I&#x27;m not sure about that claim of the average for LBL being just over 
38...doing a standard LBL with no F2L with 4LLL would be somewhere 
around 90 moves.  The (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)*2 sequence can be done quite quickly, 
which is an advantage.  Also, what makes sense to one person might 
not make a whole lot of sense to another (which makes teaching the 
cube difficult).  If it works for him, and makes sense to him, 
good.  Self-developed methods make infinite amounts of sense to the 
inventor, making them powerful in that sense.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Tim. :P

Hrm. It seems that the corners on LBL takes more moves than I 
thought. It should be something like 50 for the F2L minus cross. :/ 
I meant a few over 38 for the corners on first layer and middle 
edges.

Well, she claims 56, but it doesn&#x27;t take into account for 1) setting 
up each corner pair on F2L 2) positioning move in between OLL and 
PLL. 

I tried out the method described here (improperly placing corners) 
the night before reading that message, actually. :P It seemed to 
work pretty well, except I came to parts with improperly orient 
corners in the wrong place. When I&#x27;m doing this method, where I put 
the edges match with the centers, for example: DFR corner twisted so 
that D sticker is at F. Where I put the edge on the U-layer depends 
on the sticker that&#x27;s not at U. If that sticker is an F-sticker, 
then I put it at UB, if it&#x27;s R, UR. If the corner is in the wrong 
place, it gets harder, since I don&#x27;t have the centers as reference 
points. Bleh, I hate making mistakes in this method. Is there any 
easier way of doing this?

Assume the right hand. You put your thumb on the F sticker of the UF  <br>

simultaneously move the L and R layer using the index and ring  <br>
fingers. That&#x27;s it!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Rune,
well, being a cellist, I think I know quite well what fingers can or 
can&#x27;t do at certain ages. Rostropovitch kinda stopped playing, he still 
conducts though, but he can&#x27;t play anymore (I heard him the other day, 
it wasn&#x27;t that nice, let&#x27;s say he had an easy and uncontrolled 
vibrato...). But he&#x27;s almost 80 and not in his best shape. And again, 
that&#x27;s more a physical constraint than just an age issue. He can&#x27;t play 
anymore, well, then he just doesn&#x27;t play, that&#x27;s all. A runner with no 
legs, no matter what age, wouldn&#x27;t run. Jacqueline Du Pré died at age 
42, she was probably able to play until she was 30 or so. Then she quit. 
You know, if I feel I can&#x27;t do a particular passage at a certain pace, I 
either go slower or practice some more. Let me reformulate my example. 
Give all people in both pools not the same amount of time, but the very 
amount they think they need to get good. If someone is a quick learner, 
he/she will need less time, and if someone is a slow learner, he/she 
will need more time. You&#x27;ll get a few very good people in each pool, and 
I must insist on the fact everyone has about the same motivation and 
dedication in learning, I believe you&#x27;ll get good people of about the 
same level in both pools.
Gilles, your argument about not being able to solve a cube blindfolded 
isn&#x27;t right. I mean, have you (and I mean you personally) ever tried 
Stefan&#x27;s method at least a bit seriously? So how  many numbers are you 
using on a daily basis? credit card, that&#x27;s 4 digits, pin code of your 
cell phone, 4 again, your phone number, that&#x27;s 10, maybe your entrance 
code (yeah I know you don&#x27;t have one...), that would be around 4, and a 
few passwords. That&#x27;s way over 24 numbers for permutations, and for 
orientation, photographic memory would do. Then you just go through 
these numbers and solve them one at a time. Where&#x27;s the difficulty? Of 
course, I&#x27;m not good at it, I&#x27;m slow, I don&#x27;t succeed every time, but I 
*can* solve *a* cube blindfolded. In other words, I know how to, I&#x27;ve 
already solved a cube blindfolded. It just takes some motivation, and 
again, practice.
As for music, I get that feeling of &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I heard that guy 
play this concerto, and I&#x27;m positive I can&#x27;t play it&quot; every time I open 
a new music. Then I get myself to work, start slowly, it sounds bad, 
then after a while it eventually gets better, I get it up to tempo, I 
feel safer, I start playing music and not just notes. When I teach 
musicians how to cube, I often like to compare cubing to sightreading. 
Sight reading is playing through a piece for the first time, for those 
who aren&#x27;t into music. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming next, but you set a 
pace at the beginning, and don&#x27;t want to stop, miss something, fail a 
spot, whatnot. And it seems weird, but sight reading is actually a 
full-time job in itself. You can learn how to sight read, you can get 
better at it, of course with being a better player but not only, with 
practicing sight reading. I once heard a guy accompanying a singer on 
the piano who was rehearsing his part on some random Wagner opera, you 
know, one of these huge pieces that last forever with some guy in the 
middle who&#x27;s singing while he&#x27;s taking about 35minutes to die. Anyway. 
The pianist came in, said &quot;ok, what are we going to play today&quot;, the 
singer tells him, &quot;ah, Parsifal, ok, let&#x27;s see&quot;. The pianist opens the 
piano, takes the orchestra score and opens it, and starts reducing the 
40 parts or so (a typical Wagner orchestra), while playing a minor third 
lower because  it was too high for the singer otherwise, and sings along 
the bass part. That guy was no particular genius, it just took him a 
while to learn. It&#x27;s all a matter of dedication, really, and you can 
probably start off by being a bit more predisposed to a certain type of 
work, but that&#x27;s all.
I just doubt all the middle aged people here take as much time to 
practice their cubing skills as the rest of the kids. Back in High 
School, I used to cube around 3 or 4 hours a day, counting the bus rides 
and the solves under the table during the philosophy lesson. I can&#x27;t 
afford to lose that much time now, I&#x27;m already having enough trouble 
with fitting my girlfriend into my schedule. Gilles, you&#x27;re fast, that&#x27;s 
a fact, but honestly (I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, I could 
be surprised, but I doubt it), how much have you been practicing, lately?
As a musician, I practice around 6h/day. Or at least that&#x27;s the plan, 
but I try not to fall under 4h. If I did only one hour each day, I don&#x27;t 
even know where I would be now. How many of you above 30 practice more 
than 2 or 3 hours a day?
On a side note, I had a nice concert tonight. We played in the Gaveau 
Hall in Paris, wonderful sound, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; symphony (who&#x27;s 
the idiot who started calling it unfinished?) and Beethoven&#x27;s 5th piano 
concerto. Since we recorded that exact same program last month, we might 
get a CD shortly, if anyone is interested, email me.
Oh and pff, I don&#x27;t care about it, why did I reply, after all? Does it 
really matter to you? I mean, if it&#x27;s a physical issue, then there&#x27;s 
nothing we can do about, perhaps having a paralympics sort of event, if 
you feel you&#x27;re slow, practice more, if you know that you&#x27;re slow and 
don&#x27;t care, where&#x27;s the problem, and if you think you&#x27;re fast, good for 
you. It&#x27;s that simple.
I think I&#x27;ll stop replying, considering the time it takes me. I have to 
wake up in 5h17mins, I think I better fall asleep before.

          <div class="email-content">4x4x4 is by far my favorite cube.  I mean the edge pieces are<br>
completely independent of the rest of the cube, you can swap two edges<br>
without affecting any other piece at all.  I just can&#x27;t get over that.<br>
 It&#x27;s like having two different puzzles glued together where a turn on<br>
one puzzle will affect pieces in the other one, but both puzzles are<br>
still technically completely independent of eachother.  So cool!<br>
<br>
I like the 25th anniversary 3x3&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve had a bad experience with the<br>
DIY so far, but I will get another one with my next cube purchase and<br>
see how it goes.<br>

Hey,

I can solve the cube averaging less moves than my age, too ;-)

I am 56, and average about 54 moves per solve...54 slooow moves ;-)
about 2 turns per second.

As far as aging effects, my best average was about 29 in the 1980&#x27;s,
with a very consistent 14 second average for the first 2 layers (with 
working corner) and
a really poor 4 stage last layer...

Now, my first two layers are about 17 average on good days, and my
best average is about 24.5 for the entire cube with my 2 look last layer.

My first two layers are MUCH more efficient now, and my cubes are much
better, but my hand speed is terrible...my time spent practicing is about 
the same...
the hand speed thing seems to be due to aging...

People that have seen me cube will say, &quot;sure he&#x27;s slow, but he doesn&#x27;t use 
fingertricks&quot;...
and I am working on that...but the point is, I didn&#x27;t use them averaging 14 
for the F2L in 1985...

<br>
I just wrote an e-mail sending these to Clancy, but I figured if<br>
anyone else was interested I would post here too.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the algs I use for the 6th center for the 5x5x5.  I<br>
really just use commutators here, so the center should be all<br>
intuitive.  But for those looking for just some algs to look at/learn<br>
here are the ones I use.<br>
<br>
Notation:<br>
lowercase m,e,s stand for the centralmost slice only.  So m is just<br>
the inner m slice only.  Uppercase M is the turn (l m r&#x27;) and<br>
uppercase S is the turn (f s b&#x27;) etc..<br>

and any other commutator you like here, don&#x27;t have to use rigid algs here.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I wrote &quot;may&quot;. Your 54 moves in average with that speed is astonishing. It´s better than &quot;official&quot; fridrich. And your first two layers in 17 moves is really fantastic. You must describe the method!

PS. I think I´m mistaken. You surely mean 17 sec! (But that´s good too).

You wouldn&#x27;t happen to know (off hand) where I can get strangely

such a store but I suspect that green and yellow are not common in 
general.

Average of 17 moves for f2l is better than most fewest moves experts 
can normally do :-o So im delighted u didn&#x27;t make us look like

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Megaminx is not a rubik&#x27;s puzzle. I wouldn&#x27;t really call the 5x5x5 a 
rubik&#x27;s puzzle either since it was invented by Udo Krell in 1983. 
Likewise the 4x4x4 was invented by Peter Sebesteny in 1982. However 
rubiks.com do sell those 2 latter puzzles and have right to do so ;-)

Megaminx is invented by Uwe Meffert and sold by Mefferts ;-)

My favorite is also the 5x5x5 cube, at least when it comes to 
speedcubing. I also like fewest moves puzling on various puzzles, 
particularly on the 3x3x3 6-color cube (and supercube).

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Whoops. Sorry about my first post, it wasn&#x27;t quite detailed enough. I
do it with the cross on the bottom, and I meant FR&#x27;F&#x27;R instead of
FRF&#x27;R&#x27;. Sorry about that. What I put was the bare outline of what I
do. If the edge is placed and oriented correctly, I pull it out with
the corner while I&#x27;m placing it, and most of the time line the two up
in the process. If my D color is facing up, I do the [RUR&#x27;U&#x27;]x3. If
the edge is placed, but not oriented, I either line it up with the
corner(D color facing up), or pull it out while inserting my corner.
For different corner orientations, I do different algorithms to insert
it(like RU&#x27;R&#x27;). I also normally try to put the corner and edge im more
favorable positions before I try to insert the corner(Example: Corner
in FRU with D color up, and edge in UL position, F color up. I do
U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U before inserting the corner, because if you do the RUR&#x27;U&#x27; to
place the corner right off the bat, the edge goes in with it.

Okay, i have actually heard of something called the Halpern-Meier 
pyramid. But anyway, my point was that the Megaminx is not a rubik 
invention ;-) His name is credited to far too many puzzles. This 
actually brings the real inventors into discredit and is not fair. We 
as a community should know better than the average man in the street 
and should honor the proper originators of each puzzle :-) This should 
be reflected in how we refer to the various puzzles. Adding rubik to 
the &quot;name&quot; of all kinds of possible 3d-twisting puzzles does not make 
sense ;-)

It does make sense if you don&#x27;t see &quot;Rubik&quot; strictly only as the name 
of the person but as the name of the genre.

Compare to this, look at both definitions:

          <div class="email-content">Hey Thom,

I&#x27;ve also been trying to become more ambidextrous, in all things not 
just cubing.  I can write slowly left handed with poorer handwriting 
but still legible and am almost to the point where I can throw a 
baseball left handed with some speed, but it still feels weird to me.

As for ambi-cubing I think it helps definitely.  I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m 
not really ambidextrous, but that my hands are better at different 
things.  My right hand is good with dextrous hand/wrist movements.  
Triggers like [(R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U)] which are &quot;harder triggers&quot; than 
somthing like (R U R&#x27;) I tend to prefer right handed.  More finger 
based triggers (LUF type algs) and also finger things like cup 
stacking or one-handed cubing I tend to be better at left handed.  I 
cup stack left handed and I do my T perm (LUF alg) left handed.  
I&#x27;ve even tried to get my right handed T perm as fast as my left 
handed one and I can&#x27;t do it, my lefty T is faster by a quarter of a 
second consistently.

As to your question, I think ambi-cubing is a really good idea.  
Even if you don&#x27;t do everything with both hands equally well, try to 
find the strengths for each of your hands.  I tend to use hand/wrist 
movements with my right hand and finger triggers with my left when I 
have a choice.

Just my rambling 0.02

Do you have a guide on how to make that?  That is amazing.  It looks

          <div class="email-content">I have exactly the same experience as Chris with left and right handedness,
as far as cubing is concerned.  It&#x27;s one of the reasons I prefer algs in
LUR, instead of RUF(D) like a lot of people.  A lot of commutators and COLL
cases are very nice reflections of others that way, and things of that
nature.

I even know a lot of algs from both directions, or even multiple directions
(a lot of Sune type cases, some corner swaps, and some miscellaneous
orientations).  More angles means fewer rotations means less time lost means
faster solves.

Go for it.

          <div class="email-content">Rune,
well, being a cellist, I think I know quite well what fingers can or 
can&#x27;t do at certain ages. Rostropovitch kinda stopped playing, he still 
conducts though, but he can&#x27;t play anymore (I heard him the other day, 
it wasn&#x27;t that nice, let&#x27;s say he had an easy and uncontrolled 
vibrato...). But he&#x27;s almost 80 and not in his best shape. And again, 
that&#x27;s more a physical constraint than just an age issue. He can&#x27;t play 
anymore, well, then he just doesn&#x27;t play, that&#x27;s all. A runner with no 
legs, no matter what age, wouldn&#x27;t run. Jacqueline Du Pré died at age 
42, she was probably able to play until she was 30 or so. Then she quit. 
You know, if I feel I can&#x27;t do a particular passage at a certain pace, I 
either go slower or practice some more. Let me reformulate my example. 
Give all people in both pools not the same amount of time, but the very 
amount they think they need to get good. If someone is a quick learner, 
he/she will need less time, and if someone is a slow learner, he/she 
will need more time. You&#x27;ll get a few very good people in each pool, and 
I must insist on the fact everyone has about the same motivation and 
dedication in learning, I believe you&#x27;ll get good people of about the 
same level in both pools.
Gilles, your argument about not being able to solve a cube blindfolded 
isn&#x27;t right. I mean, have you (and I mean you personally) ever tried 
Stefan&#x27;s method at least a bit seriously? So how  many numbers are you 
using on a daily basis? credit card, that&#x27;s 4 digits, pin code of your 
cell phone, 4 again, your phone number, that&#x27;s 10, maybe your entrance 
code (yeah I know you don&#x27;t have one...), that would be around 4, and a 
few passwords. That&#x27;s way over 24 numbers for permutations, and for 
orientation, photographic memory would do. Then you just go through 
these numbers and solve them one at a time. Where&#x27;s the difficulty? Of 
course, I&#x27;m not good at it, I&#x27;m slow, I don&#x27;t succeed every time, but I 
*can* solve *a* cube blindfolded. In other words, I know how to, I&#x27;ve 
already solved a cube blindfolded. It just takes some motivation, and 
again, practice.
As for music, I get that feeling of &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I heard that guy 
play this concerto, and I&#x27;m positive I can&#x27;t play it&quot; every time I open 
a new music. Then I get myself to work, start slowly, it sounds bad, 
then after a while it eventually gets better, I get it up to tempo, I 
feel safer, I start playing music and not just notes. When I teach 
musicians how to cube, I often like to compare cubing to sightreading. 
Sight reading is playing through a piece for the first time, for those 
who aren&#x27;t into music. You don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming next, but you set a 
pace at the beginning, and don&#x27;t want to stop, miss something, fail a 
spot, whatnot. And it seems weird, but sight reading is actually a 
full-time job in itself. You can learn how to sight read, you can get 
better at it, of course with being a better player but not only, with 
practicing sight reading. I once heard a guy accompanying a singer on 
the piano who was rehearsing his part on some random Wagner opera, you 
know, one of these huge pieces that last forever with some guy in the 
middle who&#x27;s singing while he&#x27;s taking about 35minutes to die. Anyway. 
The pianist came in, said &quot;ok, what are we going to play today&quot;, the 
singer tells him, &quot;ah, Parsifal, ok, let&#x27;s see&quot;. The pianist opens the 
piano, takes the orchestra score and opens it, and starts reducing the 
40 parts or so (a typical Wagner orchestra), while playing a minor third 
lower because  it was too high for the singer otherwise, and sings along 
the bass part. That guy was no particular genius, it just took him a 
while to learn. It&#x27;s all a matter of dedication, really, and you can 
probably start off by being a bit more predisposed to a certain type of 
work, but that&#x27;s all.
I just doubt all the middle aged people here take as much time to 
practice their cubing skills as the rest of the kids. Back in High 
School, I used to cube around 3 or 4 hours a day, counting the bus rides 
and the solves under the table during the philosophy lesson. I can&#x27;t 
afford to lose that much time now, I&#x27;m already having enough trouble 
with fitting my girlfriend into my schedule. Gilles, you&#x27;re fast, that&#x27;s 
a fact, but honestly (I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, I could 
be surprised, but I doubt it), how much have you been practicing, lately?
As a musician, I practice around 6h/day. Or at least that&#x27;s the plan, 
but I try not to fall under 4h. If I did only one hour each day, I don&#x27;t 
even know where I would be now. How many of you above 30 practice more 
than 2 or 3 hours a day?
On a side note, I had a nice concert tonight. We played in the Gaveau 
Hall in Paris, wonderful sound, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; symphony (who&#x27;s 
the idiot who started calling it unfinished?) and Beethoven&#x27;s 5th piano 
concerto. Since we recorded that exact same program last month, we might 
get a CD shortly, if anyone is interested, email me.
Oh and pff, I don&#x27;t care about it, why did I reply, after all? Does it 
really matter to you? I mean, if it&#x27;s a physical issue, then there&#x27;s 
nothing we can do about, perhaps having a paralympics sort of event, if 
you feel you&#x27;re slow, practice more, if you know that you&#x27;re slow and 
don&#x27;t care, where&#x27;s the problem, and if you think you&#x27;re fast, good for 
you. It&#x27;s that simple.
I think I&#x27;ll stop replying, considering the time it takes me. I have to 
wake up in 5h17mins, I think I better fall asleep before.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ryan,

Well the reason I said two puzzles is more related to the 4x4x4 
supercube than the regular cube (though the regular one in a weird 
way is a supercube).

Even though you can&#x27;t see it, to change the parity of the corners 
you absolutely *must* change the parity of the centers too.  This 
can&#x27;t be noticed on a regular 4x4x4 but it still happens.  So the 
least destructive effect you can do is to swap two corners and two 
center pieces.  Even though this isn&#x27;t noticable you still had to do 
it, that&#x27;s why I grouped corners and edges together.

Also, left/right distinction for the edges is just an arbitrary 
definition, there really is no difference between them at all, they 
are all edges in the same orbital.

So I guess to allow the fact that you can&#x27;t actually &quot;see&quot; the odd 
permutation you perform on the centers then yes it would be:
1) corners
2) edges
3) centers

But I like it much better to view it as a physical object where all 
24 centers are actually distinct (they really are since they occupy 
different points in space), but we don&#x27;t consider them to be since 
the sticker colors are the same.

This message is probably a little too nit-picky, but I just wanted 
to say how I view the 4x4 and why it is my favorite lol.  I view it 
as (corners + edges) tied together since the parity of one *has* to 
be the same as the parity of the other, and the edge orbit which 
does it&#x27;s own thing and doesn&#x27;t listen to anybody else lol.

I use my left hand a lot to help my right hand a litte. It can work 
very fast if both of my hand cooperate..

I have noticed that both of my hands are dexterous, only they can do 
different types of moves.

1 inner slice move is not the difficulty, the problem comes as always
from full sequences.

For example, who can set the best time for MU2M&#x27;UM2UM&#x27;U&#x27;MU&#x27;MU2M&#x27;U ?

Suppose you are at a competition. Your cube will be scrambled by the
sequence ?????????????????? which is unknown to you. This regulation
gives you the option to ask for ?????????????????? to be changed to
x&#x27;yz?????????????????? if, say, you are unhappy with ????????????????.

EVEN THOUGH YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT ??????????????? is!

          <div class="email-content">Actually musicians (especially pianists) do age, and it does show in 
their playing.  There are certain pieces for the piano that do 
stress the muscles to their limit, such as most of the Etudes by 
Liszt, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot;, and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Third Piano 
Concerto.  The performer becomes totally out of breath from the 
exertion.  When you compare performances of these pieces, you will 
find that younger performers are able to play faster and more 
accurately.  Older performers play a bit slower and with 
more &quot;emotional maturity&quot;.  In speedcubing, faster is all that 
matters.  I would love to say that my cubing has gained in emotional 
maturity over the 25 years that I have been cubing, but I frankly 
don&#x27;t have a clue what &quot;cubing with emotional maturity&quot; could 
possibly mean.  I suspect that the idea of divisions based on age 
will appeal to you once you are a bit older.  

Maybe some day we will have enough data from competitions to do a 
study to determine some statistical trends that relate age to 
fastest times in competition.  It&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t have that 
many years of data from competitions, but then again, humanity 
hasn&#x27;t been around long enough to see a star go through its entire 
lifecycle, and yet astronomers know plenty about the lifecyle of 
stars.  Might it be possible to use a similar process to determine 
the lifecycle of a typical cubist?  Is Leyan likely to continue to 
get faster?  Is Rune slowing down?  Does anyone know of a young 
astrophysicist who might be willing to tackle this project?  (Just 
don&#x27;t stop organizing competitions if you decide to do this.)

Fairness can&#x27;t be the point. In your example, the blue-crosser tries 
to get the &quot;same&quot; scramble as the white-crossers. WHY? Does he think 
otherwise he&#x27;ll get a &quot;harder scramble&quot;? Crap, it could just as well 
turn out to be easier. And there&#x27;s no way to know.

The only explanation that makes sense to me is friends who use the 
same method but with different colors who want to get the &quot;same&quot; 
scramble for personal rivalry comparison.

No, he wasn&#x27;t there. But maybe we breathed the same air he had 
breathed (maybe I should&#x27;ve taken some with me in some jam glass and 
sold it on Ebay?).

The Russian art thing and the two mastermagic pictures are from the 
Studio. I have some more but we were asked not to make them public, I 
only show these three because I specifically asked for permission and 
got an ok.

          <div class="email-content">How about inspection time?  If you&#x27;re used to blue being on top, could
inspection time be wasted reorienting the cube?  This is probably
negligible, but it&#x27;s the only other valid reason I can think of.

It does seem like whether orientation is done before or after the scramble
is completely arbitrary.  Kind of like &quot;burning&quot; a card in poker when the
deck is already randomly shuffled.  Silly superstitions.  Maybe there should
be a regulation for how many lucky charms cubers are allowed to have on the
table during their solve. :-)

I bet it&#x27;ll turn up the next 48 hours. Sometimes it just does that. I 
posted about an update of my Budapest page yesterday which hasn&#x27;t 
appeared yet but I&#x27;m expecting it to do so soon...

Isn´t Tyson the right man for that?

That was what I was thinking, my post above was pretty unclear now
that I read it :) But I mean, is there really any guarantees that the
cube will be handed to you with blue in U, just because the scramble
started out with blue in U? Or is that also a regulation? &quot;The cube
shall be placed before the contestant in the orientation used during
scrambling.&quot;?.. it sounds very far fetched.. If this was really the
reason for the regulation, why not just &quot;The contestant may choose the
initial cube orientation after scrambling.&quot;?

I had to read that twice before I got it :P

yeah, of course I use my left hand to do some algs, and it&#x27;s better at
some things than my right hand. But I&#x27;m after true ambidexterity,
where I can do any move with either hand. I&#x27;m happy for a compromise,
though. 

This isn&#x27;t really related to cubing too much, it&#x27;s mroe of a life
goal, but i wondered if it&#x27;d help.

I do do one-handed with my &#x27;weak&#x27; hand though.

On another note, I did my maths lesson with my left hand again today :D

          <div class="email-content">Interesting, since I do the same. I&#x27;m left-handed, yet I feel more 
comfortable on my right hand. I&#x27;ve never seen any one-hand cubers 
use their right hands... and I don&#x27;t think there are that many 
lefties, are there?

My question is how does one find useful algs on a cube using this <br>

I guess for instance, does one sit down with a cube and start doing <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
this is really, really off topic, but as eclectic as our group is I <br>
figured I&#x27;d have a chance of meeting someone else here who might do <br>
this too.<br>
<br>
I used to really practice blowgun shooting when I was younger, but <br>
stopped when I was about 13.  Well, after trying to go through some <br>
boxes and clean up I finally found my old blowgun, some darts, and <br>
my target!  I decided to take a bunch of shots and determine my <br>
accuracy.<br>
<br>
Here is what I did:<br>
<br>
The blowgun I use is a 40 caliber Vyper with a 31in (78.74cm) barrel <br>
and looks a lot like this<br>
http://tinyurl.com/rg87q<br>
<br>
only it shoots 4.25in (10.80cm) metal darts instead of paintballs.<br>
<br>
My target is 11.44in (29.06cm) across and split up into 5 areas.  It <br>
looks like the one on this page http://tinyurl.com/kzsd5 only it <br>
doesn&#x27;t have the outermost ring as the one on that website, mine is <br>
1 ring smaller.<br>
<br>
Bullseye measures 2.00in (5.08cm) diameter<br>
within the first ring including the bullseye has a diameter of <br>
4.38in (11.13cm)<br>
within the second ring up to bullseye has a diameter 6.63in (16.84cm)<br>
within the third ring up to bullseye has a diameter 9.13in (23.19cm)<br>
and the whole target again has diameter 11.44in (29.06cm)<br>
<br>
When shooting at it I placed it at one end of my house and I shot <br>
from the furthest end away I could get to which measured out to 30 <br>
feet 2 inches almost exactly or 9.19 meters.  This distance is from <br>
the target itself to the end of the barrel on the blowgun from where <br>
I was shooting.<br>
<br>
Here were my stats with this setup.<br>
<br>
Overall tonight I took 301 shots at the target from that distance <br>
and hit the various areas the following number of times:<br>
<br>
bullseye: 41 hits<br>
1st ring only: 105 hits<br>
2nd ring only: 87 hits<br>
3rd ring only: 52 hits<br>
4th ring only: 10 hits<br>
missed the target completely: 4 shots<br>
<br>
So I got the bullseye (3.14in^2 or 20.26cm^2) with 13.6% accuracy<br>
1st ring + bullseye (15.08in^2 or 97.29cm^2) with 48.5% accuracy<br>
bulls + 1st ring + 2nd ring (34.52in^2 or 222.71cm^2) with 77.4% <br>
accuracy<br>
bulls + 1st + 2nd + 3rd (65.47in^2 or 422.39cm^2) with 94.7% accuracy<br>
whole target (102.79in^2 or 663.16cm^2) with 98.7% accuracy<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know what the standard is for blowgun shooting but I feel <br>
like this must be not bad at least.  I&#x27;m rusty from when I used to <br>
practice a lot, but I feel like with practice I could improve on <br>
this.  I think the 98.7% accuracy on hitting a target roughly 11.5in <br>
(29.06cm) diameter from 30 feet away must be pretty good, and I&#x27;m <br>
happy with the 13.6% accuracy on the bullseye which is only 2in <br>
(5.08cm) diameter from the same distance.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else practice target shooting with blowguns here?  Are <br>
these numbers good or am I a rookie compared to the real pros?  Just <br>
wanted to ask, I was happy with the results but I guess the pros who <br>
do this all the time must be insanely good, like any sport that <br>
people do a lot.<br>
<br>
Anyway I was very happy to rediscover an old hobby and wanted to see <br>
if anyone else does this.<br>

And here another piece of advice: 
......To be able to use both hands equally well, practice is the key. During the day, use your left hand more (if you&#x27;re right-handed) by consciously switching when you&#x27;re about ready to do something -- pouring a glass of milk, bouncing a ball, flipping and picking up coins, hammering a nail, cutting and buttering bread, stirring your coffee, swirling water in a glass, twisting off bottle caps, etc. Wherever you would use your one hand, use the other instead -- putting a key in the door, combing your hair, brushing your teeth, shaving, grasping objects, etc. When putting on your clothes, put your other hand or foot into the garment first. Thread your belt around your waist in the opposite direction. Put your watch on your other hand. Use your other hand in sports -- hitting a baseball or a tennis ball, throwing a football, shooting a basketball, etc. Practice stirring 2 cups of tea simultaneously, swirling 2 half filled glasses of water clockwise and counterclockwise, and bouncing two balls at the same time. Get used to the kinesthetic feeling of using the muscles of both your hands and arms together. Catch 2 balls thrown to you at the same time. Throw 2 paper wads at the same time into the same paper basket -- one underhand and the other overhand. Throw 2 darts simultaneously at a dart board with both hands. Write with both hands at the same time. Draw a butterfly, a vase or a geometric figure using both hands simultaneously, but keep practicing these exercises.

Well, you see, the formula XyX^-1y^-1, X actually has a specific 
function. For example, the three edge cycle:

X: MSDS&#x27;D2M&#x27;
y: U

Let&#x27;s say the commuter applies to the three edges ABC. A being at 
UF, B being at UR, C at UB. &quot;X&quot; swaps A and B, leaving the top layer 
untouched, and the rest of it in whatever mess it is. Then, &quot;y&quot; is 
applied, the top layer is moved, which is allowed, since it&#x27;s not 
any of the part messed up, and the process is reversed, fixing 
everything that was messed up. So few cubies were moved in the 
entire process.

          <div class="email-content">I think I understand what you are saying, X will accomplish a three 
edge swap in the upper layer, keeping the corners and remaining edge 
in their correct orientation and permutation, is this correct?  Then 
U changes their position on the cube and then the process is undone 
to get a solved cube with the 3 edges in a location.  Is this 
correct?

So how does one intuitively find these x algs that make these 
changes?  Is there some strategy to this?

          <div class="email-content">Sounds fun! Even though it&#x27;s not really much like blowgun shooting, I
used to be really into archery... until the day when one of my arrows
knicked my target, hit the chainlink fence, and flew into the roof of
a shed that belongs to the crazy lady in my neighborhood. I&#x27;ve been
grounded from it since. Anyways, I have a Cherokee-made blowgun
sitting somewhere in my basement, but I don&#x27;t have any good-condition
darts for it. I&#x27;ll have to pick some up sometime.

Usually I don&#x27;t like to install new software (Google video player in 
this case) but at least it was quick &#x27;n easy and these videos are well 
worth it.

Didn&#x27;t someone say Anssi looks slow (compared to Gunnar, I think)?? I 
can&#x27;t agree :-). I only wish the cameraman had zoomed in more closely 
in more of the videos...

I especially like Anssi&#x27;s one-handed solve, crazy fast twisting around 
10 seconds into the video!

Cheers!
Stefan

move to fix it.  hard to explain, hope you know what i mean.

i messed up because i had the corner in the B layer instead, so the

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys/gals/pals,<br>
       When I started cubing, I used a super stiff cube.  Now, though, my special cube is super loose.  I just tried a few averages with a stiff cube (really stiff), and some averages using a super loose cube.  With the really stiff cube, I got averages ranging between 16-18 seconds.  A few 16.xy averages, with effort.  However, solving with stiff cubes required different techniques than solving with a super loose cube (which I&#x27;ll mention soon).  A rather &quot;brute force&quot; moving style was needed, and some good times came up with the stiff cube- but didn&#x27;t come up as often as a loose cube.<br>
       With a super loose cube, I found it much easier to average sub 16.  This &quot;brute force&quot; approach is useless with a super loose cube- you have to be _very_ gentle, it seems, and the slices/pieces move very easily.  It takes a little practice to get used to the super loose style, however, which isn&#x27;t a big deal with practice.<br>
   <br>
  **Stiff Cubes**<br>
  --------<br>
  -(My) Average times: 16.5-18.00<br>
  -Advantages: Virtually 0% lockups [stiff + smooth].  A &quot;brute force&quot; moving style (which I like), which in the end could possibly lead to faster moves/second.  Less room for moving errors, due to smoothness and no lockups.<br>
  -Disantages to stiff cubes: harder to get faster times (though still possible for a few single times).  Requires some different techniques (takes practice to get used to).<br>
   <br>
  **Super loose cubes**<br>
  ------<br>
  -(My) Average times: (best ever: 13.88); usually range from 15-16.<br>
  -Advantages to super loose cubes: Capable of very fast times, very often.<br>
  -Disantages to super loose cubes: almost always atleast 1 lockup, which takes away time.  POPs, too, are very often.  Requires different techniques (takes practice to get used to).<br>
   <br>
  So, I ask everyone, what type of cube do you use for speed?  Hopefully everyone can answer, so a statistic can be gathered.  Maybe these results are different for each person, but I&#x27;m just suggesting that a possiblity for better times is the quality/preparation of the cube itself.<br>
   <br>
  Does anyone else have opinions about this?  Please reply if you do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brent
   
  I don&#x27;t know if my main speedcube is a &quot;super loose&quot; one, but the other one feels stiffer. I prefer the loose one, &#x27;cause I need less effort to turn the sides. But those stupid flat centers (is the old white DIY) makes it pops a lot...but I think it can be avoided...well...not totally...haha
   
  but, strangely, I most use my stiffer cube for one-handed cubing...I think the other is kinda &quot;nervous&quot;, unstable when I&#x27;m cubing one-handed...and maybe because I take the stiffer cube to school, so that people can borrow and play with it...
   
  Also, I use the stiffer one more on BLD cubing, so I have less risk of poping...which is very bad on BLD...
   
  I&#x27;m thinking about buying a new DIY kit...btw, does someone know how the PVC stickers from Rubiks are? are they much better than the (horrible) paper ones? or should I just buy the one without stickers and put on cubesmith stickers/tiles?

Just to clarify: Didn&#x27;t mean to say Gunnar looks slow, either... 
particularly not in that 13.64 solve, of course.

<br>
until last week, I hadn&#x27;t touched my 4x4 since San Francisco.  I<br>
averaged 2:13 there with a best time of 1:40.  USing standard centers<br>
first strategy, pairing up edges.<br>
<br>
This is my new way I&#x27;ve been solving the 4x4<br>
<br>
1. Build a 4x3x1 block (most of the white layer) [20 s]<br>
<br>
2. Finish remaining 5 centers  [15s]<br>
<br>
3. Pair up 6 edges  [15 s]<br>
   This is really pairing up 3, and then pairing up 3 more as you<br>
restore the centers.  I do this the same way as Frank Morris shows in<br>
his video (this is where I learned how- about a week ago).  However, I<br>
think that here it is slightly easier, because the edges are rarely on<br>
the Left side.   They are usually on the right and easy to spot. <br>
<br>
4. Pair up remaining 3 edges. [10 s]<br>
   I do this by doing 1 pair, and then doing the other 2 on way back.<br>
   just like when you do 3, and then 3 on the way back.  Sometimes<br>
you&#x27;ll get &quot;lucky&quot; and have only 2 unpaired edges.  put in U slice<br>
oriented correctly and do(R&#x27;r&#x27;)(U&#x27;RU)M&#x27;(UR&#x27;U&#x27;)(Rr)<br>
I like getting 3 better, but either way, pairing up all 9 edges is a 2<br>
step process. <br>
<br>
5. build Block 2 (13 moves)   [5 s]<br>
<br>
6. CLL  (9 moves)            [5 s]<br>
<br>
7. Last 6 edges (13 moves)   [10]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE ON CENTERS<br>
Right now I build white and yellow centers, and then build my 4x3x1<br>
block on the white side.  Then do the 4 remaing centers.<br>
I would like to just solve the 4x3x1 block directly, and then build<br>
centers with Stefans method. but I dont know if I can use this method,<br>
and keep my block intact. <br>
<br>
<br>
I like this method because you can mostly use R r U moves.  Because<br>
everything takes place on one side of the CUbe (the RIGHT side), it<br>
simplifies things a bit.  FOr example, I only use U R&#x27;U&#x27; and U&#x27;R U to<br>
insert edges.<br>
<br>
THis is really only useful if you use Roux.  If you use CFOP, it&#x27;s<br>
like having your cross done already when you finish pairing up edges.<br>
      I would go so far as to say that is equivalent to having an xcross <br>
already.  <br>
I didn&#x27;t really account for the parities in my time estimates.<br>
Using my rough estimates for time, one should be able to avg 80-90s no<br>
problem. <br>

DOES anyone else use this approach already?  Or did I finally do<br>

          <div class="email-content">For a while, I toyed with doing centers, then pairing/placing the edges of<br>
the first layer correctly to start.  After that, pair the middle layer<br>
edges, and use F2L to solve the pairs.  Then, pair up the U edges using<br>
commutators.  My best times were under 2 minutes with this, but I didn&#x27;t<br>
work on it long.  It&#x27;s very much the same as traditional centers first, but<br>
you have the added bonus of good recognition for all steps always, and your<br>
F2L and cross are made easier.<br>

Btw, are the moves and times given averages or maximums. If they are 
maximums i can&#x27;t believe it ;-) How would u for instance flip the 
last 6 edges in 13 turns? Or would u be able to avoid those bad 
cases?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty new to cubing, and I&#x27;ve never felt another speedcubers
cube, so I have nothing to compare with. My guess is that my cube is
&quot;close to really loose&quot;. Just a couple of days I got my new stickers,
and took the time to lubricate the cube again (I use silicone spray).
I must say, my cube is feeling better than ever and I&#x27;ve been doing
personal bests for a couple of days (still only around 40-45 seconds,
since I&#x27;m new). I know that I _definately_ can&#x27;t cube with the cubes
without some lubrication (I&#x27;ve only used 25th anniversary cubes), then
again I&#x27;m a programmer, I have no arm muscles :)

The times listed were just estimates.  I&#x27;ve only just started using
this method, But I think I can get to 80 sec with it in no time.  The
move estimates are averages.  9 for CLL, 13 for L6E, 13 for B2.

FLIPPING 6 edges in 9 moves: (RU&#x27;)MU&#x27;M&#x27;U(rUr&#x27;)

typical roux solve.
set up: M2U2M2UMU&#x27;M&#x27;
Execution:(M&#x27;UM&#x27;U2)(MU)(M&#x27;U&#x27;)(M2U2M2)

another typical roux solve
set up: M&#x27;U2MUMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;U&#x27;M
Execution: (M&#x27;U)(MU&#x27;)(MU2)(M&#x27;U&#x27;)(M&#x27;U2M)
 
Getting 4 bad edges is the best situation
If I get the orientation parity, I try to influence edges.
Because you finish every solve with the M slice, the permutation
parity is easy to recognize.  I use U2 r2 U2 r2 u2 r2 u2

HERE IS A POST WORTH LOOKING AT.

          <div class="email-content">Plastic PVC stickers for all cubes are $4.99 USD.  You get 3 sets of 
stickers for the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5, each 3 sets cost $4.99.

They are a ton better than the paper-the paper stickers come off

Maybe these results are different for each person, but I&#x27;m just

quality/preparation of the cube itself.

But when you buy the PVC stickers with the DIY kit, they cost $2.00 (10.99 -
8.99), and you get 2 sets...I was wondering what is better...buy the cube
that comes just with the lube, and put cubesmith stickers; or buy the one
that comes with 2 sets of PVC stickers...

I checked it out. I ended up not leaving with a 3x3x3 but with a 
5x5x5 instead. Not the best colour scheme (white opposite yellow!) 
and also with a purplish side. I guess I need to paint it some time.
Unfortunately at least one of the centre caps came off as well. No 
good for blindfolding if that happens. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to glue it 
on. Is glue generally OK to use on plastic?

It does seem to turn quite well, even though it isn&#x27;t lubricated 
yet, which could be a good sign.

          <div class="email-content">PBP METHOD(Piece By Piece) or STEFAN POACHMANN METHOD :- I memorise centers, edges and corners and solves them in the same order. I solve one piece at a time. I solve corners using T- permutation algm. If it happens to be odd number of times, then I swap UL and UR edges at the end.<br>
                                                    In this method the solving phase is almost continuous without stopping for thinking and peak concentration is not required. The set up and reset up moves are almost a second nature after practicing a while.But the number of turns is much more than any other method. The percentage of success is very high. The perfect solve is a pleasure even if the time taken is more. Well done Stefan!<br>
   <br>
  FC METHOD (Free Cycling) or CHRIS HARDWICK METHOD :- The memorisation is same as the previous method. Solves 2 centers and 2 edges at a time by free cycling. The steps are all intutive. Every step has different algm.<br>
                     After every cycle, I have to pause to think about my next cycle and posssible commutator or algm. This pause supercede the time taken for solving by Stefan&#x27;s method.  But the idea behind it and the pleasure I derive by thinking on the spot is inexplicable. It is a challenge. Peak concentration is a must throughout  the solve. You have to be a  very confident person.  The percentage of success is not so high as the PBP method for me. I am yet to master this method. However, this method forces me to think a lot and develops my confidence about myself. Well done Chris Hardwick !<br>

   How does Mr.Frank Morris go about soving 5*5*5 edges. Is he solving all yellow triplets first, followed by white tripplets and finally the rest? What is his best and worst edge pairing up time? Does he spend 10 + sec in the last 2 pairs, if pairity arise or is he having any knack of eliminating pairity ?

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, what Clancy said  :)
   
  I am pretty busy, but I took an &quot;average&quot; of the phases over 7 solves, and here are the stats.
   
  Centers:  (41.17), 34.38, 41.12, (39.18), 33.29, 38.01, 34.20 = 36.2 avg
  Edges:  (48.22), 55.11, 57.10, 53.78, (61.47), 55.88, 49.69 = 54.31 avg
  3x3 Solve:  21.57, 23.29, 25.81, 25.82, 25.43, (26.33), (20.62) = 24.38 avg
   
  I am adjusting some things in my method, and those are evident in some areas, such as the 41&#x27;s in the centers, and the 61 on edges.  There is still alot of improvement left.  
   
  Hope this is of some help, or whatever.

Then finishes the last 4, i&#x27;ll be updating bigcubes with the better edge method sometime this week hopefully, which should demonstrate the first 8 edges method.  the last 4 can be pretty complex to do all at once, so usually you can just break it down into a couple smaller cases.  as far as the parity goes, it would be pretty hard to eliminate it entirely (counting cycles on this would be impossible for me anyway) i know he uses the stuff from bigcubes.com final edges index, some algs from other people (like the 3 middle edge flip from frederick), as well as some advanced stuff he has come up with to get those last 4 done quicker, as of right now i know he&#x27;s still working on that so its not on bigcubes and won&#x27;t be public for a
while. His typical breakdown is around 35 centers 55 edges and 25 final solve.  feel free to throw up, i know i did. ;)

Subject: [Speed cubing group] 5*5*5 edge pairing up

   How does Mr.Frank Morris go about soving 5*5*5 edges. Is he solving all yellow triplets first, followed by white tripplets and finally the rest? What is his best and worst edge pairing up time? Does he spend 10 + sec in the last 2 pairs, if pairity arise or is he having any knack of eliminating pairity ?

          <div class="email-content">I have no idea how to describe my cube. I just scrubbed and lubed it
last night, and today, it does double turns with about the same
strength it took me to do a quarter turn. Sometimes my U layer moves a
half turn when doing RUR&#x27;U&#x27; now. Anyways, my times have ranged from
high fifties(first solve with it) to a 27.xx (best time). I still
don&#x27;t know whether I want to &quot;unlube&quot; it or try to get used to it as
it is.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Brent,

Well... I can say I prefer cubes that are super loose, and I also 
have a &#x27;gentle style&#x27;, that is adjusted to this loose cube. I prefer 
loose and smooth cubes (internals should be smooth), and I also like 
it when the lube is still a little wet.. :).

To illustrate how loose it is, and how I adjusted my style to it: I 
barely ever pop with my cube, but when I gave my cube to Ton 
Dennebroek at a Dutch meeting recently, he popped after 5 seconds. I 
think this is quite typical... In order to cube, I have to be 
extremely relaxed and smooth. I kinda trained myself a relaxed and 
focussed style... (inspired by some cool cubers).

I also have some new DIY&#x27;s, that are quite loose, but not smooth 
inside yet, and with those cubes I can&#x27;t come at the same speed that 
I have with my main speedcube. With the main speedcube, I average 
under 15 seconds quite frequently now, but with the newer cubes, 
sub16 is pretty hard.

- Joël.

Maybe these results are different for each person, but I&#x27;m just 
suggesting that a possiblity for better times is the 
quality/preparation of the cube itself.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks to Mr.Clancy and Mr.Frank. Wow!  55 sec avg for edges! That is incredible. I am pretty close with frank&#x27;s centers and 3*3*3 solve. But in edges I am far behind, say 60 to 80 sec. I must practice a lot and I will try my best.

  Yeah, what Clancy said  :)
   
  I am pretty busy, but I took an &quot;average&quot; of the phases over 7 solves, and here are the stats.
   
  Centers:  (41.17), 34.38, 41.12, (39.18), 33.29, 38.01, 34.20 = 36.2 avg
  Edges:  (48.22), 55.11, 57.10, 53.78, (61.47), 55.88, 49.69 = 54.31 avg
  3x3 Solve:  21.57, 23.29, 25.81, 25.82, 25.43, (26.33), (20.62) = 24.38 avg
   
  I am adjusting some things in my method, and those are evident in some areas, such as the 41&#x27;s in the centers, and the 61 on edges.  There is still alot of improvement left.  
   
  Hope this is of some help, or whatever.

  i know frank is pretty busy today so he might not be able to respond, but from what i know he has gotten past strictly using white and yellow first, but he does 8 sets of edges, using the E (u e d) ring as the work layers and storing on U and D. Then finishes the last 4, i&#x27;ll be updating bigcubes with the better edge method sometime this week hopefully, which should demonstrate the first 8 edges method.  the last 4 can be pretty complex to do all at once, so usually you can just break it down into a couple smaller cases.  as far as the parity goes, it would be pretty hard to eliminate it entirely (counting cycles on this would be impossible for me anyway) i know he uses the stuff from bigcubes.com final edges index, some algs from other people (like the 3 middle edge flip from frederick), as well as some advanced stuff he has come up with to get those last 4 done quicker, as of right now i know he&#x27;s still working on that so its not on bigcubes and won&#x27;t be public for a
while. His typical breakdown is around 35 centers 55 edges and 25 final solve.  feel free to throw up, i know i did. ;)

Subject: [Speed cubing group] 5*5*5 edge pairing up

   How does Mr.Frank Morris go about soving 5*5*5 edges. Is he solving all yellow triplets first, followed by white tripplets and finally the rest? What is his best and worst edge pairing up time? Does he spend 10 + sec in the last 2 pairs, if pairity arise or is he having any knack of eliminating pairity ?

I think it&#x27;s better to learn them the way he has it.  That way you
don&#x27;t have to learn 48 algorithms.  You can just practice doing ones
you already know, backwards, and a few of them symmetrically.

To-day I got my DIYs (four black sets) and with your excellent guidance even I succeeded in assembling the cubes. Unfortunately, in one set there were only five washers, in another four (I Have looked in the edge pieces). But for the first, such things always happen to me, so why shouldn´t it happen this time? For the second, Stefan´s washers seem to fit, so there is nothing to worry about.
Well, thank you!

Regarding the missing washers:  I was sure that I had a missing one 
too.  I know you said you checked the edge pieces, but take each one 
and bang it on a hard surface.  Mine was actually lodged deep inside 
the foot of an edge piece and it wasn&#x27;t rattling around.

Rune,

Regarding the missing washers:  I was sure that I had a missing one 
too.  I know you said you checked the edge pieces, but take each one 
and bang it on a hard surface.  Mine was actually lodged deep inside 
the foot of an edge piece and it wasn&#x27;t rattling around.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m also not really a &quot;fast guy&quot; but my F2L tends to be low 10.x or 
sub-10 very consistently.  I guess that qualifies me as &quot;struggling 
for sub-10&quot; since I often get 10 second averages, but if I am 
concentrating well I can do a sub-10 without a huge amount effort it 
seems.  I&#x27;ve never been sub-9 for F2L on average.

My LL is bad compared to my F2L.  A really good average is about 
6.00 seconds or very slightly sub-6 (5.9x).  I found that even when 
I use the same algs (like the T perm) as you fast LL guys I can&#x27;t 
seem to do the triggers as fast.  Wish I had faster fingers :-P

If you want to help your F2L consider Xcross and dual solving 
combined.  A roughly 50% chance for an Xcross on any given solve 
sped me up considerably.  I average about 12-13 seconds on F2L if I 
always solve the same color cross and never do Xcross.

          <div class="email-content">Hi J. Bernett and Richard,

Richard: I define a &quot;freestyle commutator&quot; to be a commutator used on 
the cube for blindfolded purposes where one of the permutation parts 
of the commutator is only a single slice turn, and the other is what I 
call an &quot;insert alg&quot;.  So if you have PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; then either P or Q, but 
not both, is only a single slice turn, and the other part inserts one 
piece onto the slice that the slice turn affects.  That doesn&#x27;t sound 
clear to me, so it would be that say P is a slice turn and Q inserts 
one piece onto the slice that P turns leaving the rest of the slice 
unaffected.  Same with the vice versa switching P and Q.

J. Bernett: That&#x27;s awesome that you&#x27;re getting more interested in the 
free cycling approach!  I personally like it a whole lot, and as far 
as ways to practice it and get better just try to find 
different &quot;types&quot; of commutators that you can use.  The more types you 
have the more options you&#x27;ll see during your solve.

Here are some of the most important types of commutators I use:

Edges:
Slide on the bottom: r&#x27; D r U2 r&#x27; D&#x27; r U2
direct insert: R&#x27; d&#x27; R U R&#x27; d R U&#x27;
mostly face move type 1: R U R&#x27; u&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; u
mostly face move type 2: R U2 R&#x27; d R U2 R&#x27; d&#x27;
pull from the lower middle: R&#x27; d R U R&#x27; d&#x27; R U&#x27;
pull from the upper middle: R&#x27; u&#x27; R U R&#x27; u R U&#x27;
merry-go-round: U R u R&#x27; U R u&#x27; R&#x27; U2

Centers:
cycle on opposite faces: b2 r F r&#x27; b2 r F&#x27; r&#x27;
on 3 different faces: r U2 r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27;
on 2 faces type 1: r&#x27; d r U r&#x27; d&#x27; r U&#x27;
on 2 faces type 2: r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r U2
on 1 face: (do 1 setup turn to make it cycling on opposite faces or a 
on 2 faces type)

center blocks:
on 2 different faces: r&#x27; (ud&#x27;) r U2 r&#x27; (du&#x27;) r U2
on 3 different faces: r U2 r&#x27; (u&#x27;d) r U2 r&#x27; (ud&#x27;)

Edge blocks:
if NO corner parity: Do as two commutators.  If you have (PQ)(ST) as 
the pieces that swap do the commutator cycle (PQS) followed by (PTS) 
to solve those two 2swaps.

if corner parity: finish this two edge groups and the 2 corners 
together using a T permutation or something similar from the 3x3x3 
when you run into parity on a 3x3x3 solve.  You MUST do this after 
solving the centers, since fixing the corner parity *requires* that 
you perform an odd cycle on the centers.  If your centers are 
unsolved, you must account for this fix, which is a pain.  Be careful 
that the two edge groups are &quot;flipped&quot; the same way as per the 3x3, or 
else you&#x27;ll end the cube with two edges swapped.

The trick is being able to view these commutators as &quot;types&quot; rather 
than as algs.  For example the alg above

mostly face move type 2: R U2 R&#x27; d R U2 R&#x27; d&#x27;

is just a type.  I would also do &quot;mostly face move type 2&quot; like this 
also:
1) R&#x27; F2 R f R&#x27; F2 R f&#x27;
2) F R2 F&#x27; l F R2 F&#x27; l&#x27;
3) R&#x27; D2 R u&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R u
4) B L2 B&#x27; r B L2 B&#x27; r&#x27;
5) R B2 R&#x27; b&#x27; R B2 R&#x27; b
6) etc..

and the same goes for every type above.  Be able to do each of 
the &quot;types&quot; from any possible angle and on any face combination.  Do 
not limit yourself to using them as I wrote them, be able to do them 
on all faces, and be comfortable looking for them everywhere.

----------

Example:

(fUR->rUF->dFR)

This situation for edges looks like you need to do the setup move f&#x27; 
then use the &quot;pull from the lower middle&quot; type of edge commutator.  
But in fact this is already a &quot;merry-go-round&quot; without any setup turns.

Use the merry-go-round type like this:
F&#x27; L f2 L&#x27; F&#x27; L f2 L&#x27; F2

-----------

The basic premise of freestyle cycling is to try to never, ever ever 
ever never ever ever do setup moves.  This isn&#x27;t possible of course, 
you need right at 1.0 on average.  However, try your best to never 
ever do any setup moves whatsoever.  This will speed up your solve 
since the setup moves are not like for Stefan&#x27;s method, they create a 
whole new setup and make you rethink which pieces cycle where.  Also 
the setup moves are not, and cannot be memorized like for Stefan&#x27;s 
method, since you always have two other pieces in random positions of 
the cube to try to preserve, or account for if your setup moves 
include moving one of them too.

So in short, just have a lot of types of freestyle commutators and 
avoid setup moves whenever possible and as much as possible.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tim,
Lots of ideas for this.  I suggest something like one edge (say the UL 
edge), then pairing up the next corner and edge (UFL and UF) and putting 
them in, then the next (UFR and UR) and the next (URD and UD).  This leaves 
you with a singe corner which you can use for a traditional pair if you 
like.  there are other ways but this is pretty efficient.

Good luck.

Duncan
PS Will improve the site to all those who have asked - I promise.  Might get 
a pro to do it for me.

          <div class="email-content">Duncan, I have somewhat of a silly request for you.  I&#x27;m in the process of
switching to a method where you coompletely orient all edges at the
beginning of a solve.  As such, it leaves one with all edges oriented
throughout the F2L steps.

For many cases, the final corner is already in place, but an edge is still
in the U layer.  As the algs to preserve the orientation, while inserting
that edge are not very fast, I was thinking that perhaps it would be good to
palce that edge and simultaneously orient the U corners, or even permute
them instead.  Do you have any algs that place the final edge and orient or
permute corners without affecting edge orientation?

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I started using intuitive fridrich F2L about 2.5 months ago, and I am now finally at the point where I can look at most of the 41 cases and know an optimized way to solve it. <br>
The only ones for which I can not quickly see an optimized (or close) solution are the ones where the corner and edege are incorrectly placed, but in the correct slot... for these cases, I just remove them from that slot and solve them normally, wasting a few moves.<br>
<br>
My best F2L times are ~25 seconds, but average is closer to 40 seconds, and sometimes even slower than that. My overall average is now under a minute (yesterday i was averaging around 56-57 seconds).. <br>
<br>
Although I know I will get better with more practice, I want to keep learning new things. I know how advanced and complicated this F2L solving can get, and I was wondering what tricks I should start learning next. What is the best way to handle cases (for example) where both of my pieces aren&#x27;t in the LL ? <br>
   <br>
  When I have a corner in the LL, and an edge which isn&#x27;t, I usually rotate the LL and then bring the edge up so that I can get one of the R U R&#x27; moves, or F&#x27; U&#x27; F. I bet this isn&#x27;t the best way to handle these.<br>
   <br>
  When I have an edge which is on the LL, and a corner which is not, i rotate the LL until I can bring my corner up and form a U&#x27; F&#x27; U F case.<br>
   <br>
  I know I can be better!!<br>
<br>
Let me know, and of course general tips for anything are welcome as well!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you don&#x27;t know all the algs for a 4LLL, you should prolly learn those. A while back when I wanted to learn 4LLL, Craig Bouchard compiled a list of all the verions of the algs that he thought would be easiest to perform for a beginner. These are all the algs you need for a 4LLL:

-----------
   
  Orient Edges(the cross):
http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html
Cases 1 and 2
http://www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/OLL5.html
the first case on there...
  Orient Corners:
http://www.cubewhiz.com/oll.html
Cases 4-10 (all good)
  Permute Corners:
http://www.cosine-systems.com/cubestation/permutations/permutationslist.php
Cases 3 and 4
http://www.cubewhiz.com/pll.html
Case 3
  Permute Edges:
http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/PLL.html
Case 1 and 2 and 6
(Dan&#x27;s Cubestation)
http://www.cosine-systems.com/cubestation/permutations/permutationslist.php
Case 5 the first algorithm that begins with the x...
   
  ------------
   
  petty simple, just one alg for every orientation of the corners, for every orientation of the edges, every corner permutation, and every edge permutation.
   
  I&#x27;m not an expert, but i average in the 50&#x27;s now, and my average is dropping like 2 seconds per day, which is really exciting. 
   
  the most important thing is F2L though.. i am just getting started with Fridrich F2L (well, i&#x27;ve been doing it for 2-3 months, but I&#x27;m just starting to be able to use it well), and i will say that it makes cubing much more fun. Using the LBL method is really, really boring.
   
  Ya, there is no clear site to go off of, b/c it&#x27;s intuitive. Sadly, Doug Reed&#x27;s page (which offered a decent explnation) and WikiCube (which is the same thing) are BOTH down right now, and have been for a few days...
   
  all you do really is learn to recognize 2 cases (4 cases, 2 of them are mirrors)
   
  http://speedcubing.com/f2l_crossbottom.html
   
  cases:
  b02
b04
b13
b15
   
  It is obvious how those algorithms work... understand it, and how to recognize it. Then, the fun part is to take corner-edge pairs, get them into the last layer (IE, not into random F2L slots), and then pair them up so that they look like one of those 4 cases... then solve them.
   
  Print out that whole page too, all 41 algorithms... after an hour or so of tinkering, use the cheat-sheet to help you see the fastest way to get any situation into a pair.
   
  hope this helps

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Reading about Chris&#x27; freestyle cycles approach sounds almost like i 
do most of the stuff for my cage method. I&#x27;t all about being able to 
make up various kinds of 3-cycles on the fly.

Here are some rules of thumb regarding when setup moves are 
necessary:

- all 3 cubies are on the same slice, then setup move(s) is 
needed ... must bring at least one cubie out of the slice that will 
be turned by Q (PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;)

- none of the 3 cubies are on the same slice, then setup move(s) is 
needed ... must bring 2 cubies into same slice

- even if 2 cubies are on the same slice, those 2 cubies must be 
rotation-invariant by the move Q ... those 2 cubies must lie on the 
same orbital on that slice

 Example : for an edge 3-cycle ... assuming 2 of the edges are URf 
and ULf ... they are rotation invariant if Q is moving the f layer, 
but NOT rotation invariant if Q moves U ... if the locations were 
URf and ULb they are rotation invariant on the U layer :D

Actually for the most part i will have Q moving an outer layer when 
doing my commutator 3-cycles. It just seems easier to me ;-)

Cheers!

Usually I don&#x27;t like to install new software (Google video player in 
this case) but at least it was quick &#x27;n easy and these videos are well 
worth it.

Didn&#x27;t someone say Anssi looks slow (compared to Gunnar, I think)?? I 
can&#x27;t agree :-). I only wish the cameraman had zoomed in more closely 
in more of the videos...

I especially like Anssi&#x27;s one-handed solve, crazy fast twisting around 
10 seconds into the video!

Wow, Marilyn became sloppy. Assumption 1 is not included in the 
question at all and the &quot;most&quot; in assumption 2 isn&#x27;t, either. Real 
newbie mistakes...

All those videos give me the impression there was always just one 
person solving at a time. Is that correct?

Anssi, can you tell the PLL algorithm of your 14.08 solve? The ending 
looks sweet.

  I&#x27;m also a (not very fast) speedcuber. My normal average is about 17-19 seconds, with a PB of 17.12. Can I add you on messenger so you can give me some tips?

  Duncan, I have somewhat of a silly request for you.  I&#x27;m in the process of
  switching to a method where you coompletely orient all edges at the
  beginning of a solve.  As such, it leaves one with all edges oriented
  throughout the F2L steps.

  For many cases, the final corner is already in place, but an edge is still
  in the U layer.  As the algs to preserve the orientation, while inserting
  that edge are not very fast, I was thinking that perhaps it would be good to
  palce that edge and simultaneously orient the U corners, or even permute
  them instead.  Do you have any algs that place the final edge and orient or
  permute corners without affecting edge orientation?

B2 D2 F2 L&#x27; F2 D2 B2 R&#x27; is shorter but horrible to perform ;-)

By first turning the cube physically it&#x27;s faster performed as:

L2 D2 R2 F&#x27; R2 D2 L2 B&#x27; :D

Still not as fast as the 2-g solution though!

Cheers!

Actually this one is probably the best version :

(R2 u2 R2 F&#x27;)*2

Just adjust the cube appropriately first.

(R2 u2 R2 F)*2 is useful too ;-)

Have fun!

Nomatter how I&#x27;ve tried I cant get em to work properly.<br>
<br>
Compared to the rubik.com DIY&#x27;s I bought 4 months ago there&#x27;s a HUGE<br>
difference.<br>
The ones bought in december are my absolute favourite ones.<br>
The ones I got home last week is barely usable nomatter how much time<br>
I&#x27;ve spent trying to adjust the springs, lubricate, and cut uneven<br>
plastic-edges away.<br>
<br>
The difference in weight between thoose cubes are also big.<br>
The plastic material also seems to be different.<br>
E.g there are two different type of cubes I got here.<br>
<br>
Is this something I have to calculate with when ordering cubes online?<br>
Is anyoneelse having the same experience ?<br>
Anyone know how to get thoose recently bought cubes to a good state?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve contacted rubiks.com but havent received any answer yet.<br>

Can you tell the weight of the new cubes?

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm... well the kits that went on sale at the beginning of 2006 are 
of a different manufacture.  But in my opinion the new ones are 
better.  They are lighter (the plastic walls are thinner than last 
year), and the manufacturing of each piece is more precise.  Refer 
to message 26318 for some photos and descriptions I posted.  See if 
those match what you received.  I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with mine--
 it&#x27;s basically all I use now.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tim,
Suppose you have UL in place.  Then I place UF in the FL position (U sticker 
on the F face) and then position the UFL corner next to it in the FDL 
position.  Then F puts them in place.  (Or this whole process mirror image 
on B instead of F).  Each pair should be 3-5 moves I think.  The moves to 
position the corner next to the edge are pretty quick and intuitive and I 
haven&#x27;t written them all out but there aren&#x27;t any especially difficult 
cases - certainly easier than some F2L pairs!  You should definitely average 
under 20 like this and with practice of spotting moves you should get in the 
15-17 region.  Personally if it looks like a tricky case that I don&#x27;t spot 
quickly I am likely to miss 1, 2 or 3 corners and use L2L1, or 2 instead or 
L2L4.  But this shouldnt&#x27; be necessary!
I think it was Paul Nixon who suggested that an adaption of the Petrus start 
would be a good way to start the first layer too but I haven&#x27;t tried this.
The fastest L2L method is to combine steps 2 and 3 of the L2L4 - moves found 
but not on the site.  this allows you to leave one first layer corner 
unfinished and put in F2L pair there instead.

Good luck again - keep trying and if you are still struggling e-mail me 
private and I will try to write out the FL cases (promises promises - not 
got much time!)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

Wow, that was a lot of help in just a few lines. :) I was thinking up 
a way using L2L4 in the same order of steps, such that when you finish 
your FL, you already have 1-3 of the 2nd layer edges in already (which 
conflicts with the current L2L4 system). The best, IMO, would be a 
Corners-Edges LL system, since skipping one or two edges in more 
common. For 1 edge in already, you do steps 1-3 (preserving, of 
course), and then do one of the three edge PLL algorithms. For 2, you 
do 1-2 preserving, and do all the edges in one algorithm. In the rare 
case of 3-4 edges in, just step 1 (instead of 3) and do one of two of 
the corner permutation algors and go on with the edges. Four edges, 
well, consider yourself lucky to have a 35/37-move cube. :P  What are 
your thoughts on this?

          <div class="email-content">It seems like I have the same type of pieces as shown at the pics in
message #26318. 

Hopefully I was to quick with my negative oppinion about this new type
of cube.
I reassembled my six new cubes. scrambled all the pieces and rebuilt
them from scratch. 
I made 2 cubes with realy &quot;hard&quot; springs.
2 with loose springs and two with normal (something inbetween hard and
loose).

It seems like the ones with hard springs works fine now.
The ones with loose springs isn&#x27;t working at all. (stucking all the
time when twisting)

It feels like you have to have screw in thoose screws more than you&#x27;re
used to from the old cubies to get them to work fine.
So if you&#x27;re used to realy loose springs (as I) it might be a problem.

one more thing;  you realy need to glue thoose centercaps... no way
they are staying in right place otherwise.

I gotta fix my other cubes now. I&#x27;m quite sure they&#x27;re going to work
much better with more tensed springs.

<br>
Yes, that&#x27;s true.  It used to be about 1mm was good.  Now it&#x27;s more <br>
like 0.5mm depending on your preference.  The old DIY when assembled <br>
were actually slightly less than 57mm.  The new ones seem to be back <br>
to standard size again.  I think the pieces are just a fraction <br>
larger.  Of course it probably depends on the particular batch, but I <br>
really believe they updated the molds for these latest parts.<br>
<br>
&gt; one more thing;  you realy need to glue thoose centercaps... no way<br>

<br>
Nah, just cut a square piece of paper to fit over the center <br>
(including the walls) and mash the cap onto it.  Mine have stayed put <br>
for several weeks now like that.  That was one of the best <br>
improvements of the new manufacture-- caps that don&#x27;t need glue! <br>
(Right, Stefan?)  Actually I found that the old caps can be modified <br>
by breaking off the two tabs with pliers.  Then they behave like the <br>
new ones.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s a neat alg, Per.  I&#x27;m going to steal that and play with it.

And I know that the 2 gen alg Ron posted can be quite fast, but the corners
only come up oriented 1/27 of the time.  I&#x27;m looking for algs to help
transform the Sune, Double Sune, and Bruno cases into U/T/L/skips for corner
orientation.

This is all done very easily and intuitively for the cases with a normal
pair to insert (case 1 or 13 from Chris Hardwick&#x27;s ZBF2L page), but I&#x27;m
looking for a better way to influence corner orientation from the edge and
corner correctly placed cases than just taking them out and putting them
back in.

There exists to my knowledge one multiplayer game involving the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube, and that is the Rubik&#x27;s Game, the cube with the holes <br>
and the pegs.  So why on earth, at tournaments, is there not a Rubik&#x27;s <br>

points for getting a certain place with a certain number of people, <br>

  Hi :-)

Reading about Chris&#x27; freestyle cycles approach sounds almost like i 
do most of the stuff for my cage method. I&#x27;t all about being able to 
make up various kinds of 3-cycles on the fly.

Here are some rules of thumb regarding when setup moves are 
necessary:

- all 3 cubies are on the same slice, then setup move(s) is 
needed ... must bring at least one cubie out of the slice that will 
be turned by Q (PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;)

- none of the 3 cubies are on the same slice, then setup move(s) is 
needed ... must bring 2 cubies into same slice

- even if 2 cubies are on the same slice, those 2 cubies must be 
rotation-invariant by the move Q ... those 2 cubies must lie on the 
same orbital on that slice

Example : for an edge 3-cycle ... assuming 2 of the edges are URf 
and ULf ... they are rotation invariant if Q is moving the f layer, 
but NOT rotation invariant if Q moves U ... if the locations were 
URf and ULb they are rotation invariant on the U layer :D

Actually for the most part i will have Q moving an outer layer when 
doing my commutator 3-cycles. It just seems easier to me ;-)

Cheers!

I&#x27;ve had some troubles with my hands a while ago, the only good
medicine I can advice is rest. These days I&#x27;m resting my hands a lot
because they will have a tough month (German Open, Belgian Open). If
it is very painful (as it seems), maybe you should ask a doctor.

If you haven&#x27;t yet, tell your dad about it. Maybe you should really go 
to a doctor, it sounds very bad. Even if it&#x27;s not dangerous, he can 
give you the best advice what to do and not to do. Stop cubing and 
other hand/arm straining activities for a while. Maybe read books, 
practice memorization, ...

I would stop cubing for at least ONE MONTH, even
if the condition seems to improve.
Don&#x27;t play with your health.

I guess over-cubing could induce tendinitis, and other
bone/nerve/tendon injuries.

I wonder if it could induce CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome), like
for the people who use a keyboard intensively. If I had your
problems I would check my symptoms against CTS. If CTS is
suspected, I would definitely stop cubing and switch to sudoku.

Good luck.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for all your suggestions and advise. Yes, I am taking a break now. I informed my dad and he is taking me to our doctor tomorrow. 
  School is closed for 75 days for summer vacation. It is too hot here nowadays(42 degree celcius). So I can not go out to play also. 
  I already had a mild pain. But since solving 142 cubes in an hour a few days ago, the pain was severe. My mum applied some pain reliever today. But still it is paining severely. My dad was joking that he also has severe pain because he scrambled 142 cubes so fast.
  I am wooried taking a break might slow down my speed when I restart.
   
  So this forced me to do something different today. I found an old VCD in my mums table marked John Louis WEDS Poulin Selvarani, 19 MAY 1989. I watched this hour long cd fully again and again. It was all fun. My mum and dad looked very different. My grand parents were looking young and I could not identify many of my relatives and my dads friends. I was really surprised to see such a big crowd in my parents wedding day and my mum told me that my dad has many good friends and that is his only wealth.
   
  Anybody has the chance to watch your parents wedding vcd ?

Hehe.

I read that &quot;roux cubes&quot; were very useful in cooking too, but I don&#x27;t
know exactly what they are. Some funny quotes I found on the web:
- &quot;I used a quick roux substitute method I&#x27;d read about on another
cooking website&quot;.
- &quot;Many Cajun grandmothers have switched over to instant roux because
it is easier and quicker&quot;.
- &quot;I suppose you could make a roux in the microwave, and I guess that
with practice you can learn how to do it properly. But it seems like a
pretty dicey proposition to me.&quot;

Roux is such a common name (about 60000 Rouxes in France), it&#x27;s not
very surprising some have given their name to things like cube objects.

Weel, that is at least my goal. If I don&#x27;t break it at German Open I&#x27;m
going to switch to a more complex, and faster, method so I can get closer.

          <div class="email-content">About two months ago, I started feeling pains in my right thumb,
directly after playing with my EXTREMELY stiff Rubik&#x27;s 5*5*5. It
didn&#x27;t go away, so I had a break from cubing for 3-4 weeks. Then I
started practicing for the Swedish cube competition. I can still feel
it every once in a while, but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was. I usually
feel it while cubing, so I don&#x27;t practice as much now as I did before.
 After German Open I&#x27;m thinking of tkeing a break for a month or so to
see if it dissappears, so I can tart training for the European
Championships.

Congrats.
All you have to do now is to be the first below 12.
If your progression is linear, that&#x27;ll be before next sunday.

Good luck.

Right... apart from the camera, that&#x27;s the much better explanation. 
Now I feel a bit stupid :-)

Ok, in the future I&#x27;ll print computer generated scrambles on its pages

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
The intention of the regulations (stopping with fingers) is that you cannot manipulate the puzzle when you use your fingers to stop the timer.<br>
If you use your palms you can (un)intentionally cheat.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Ok I have a question about this now.  I just got back from the sport 
stacking world championships and they allow their competitors to start 
and stop the timer anywhere above the wrist.  You can use palms, 
fingers, palm on one hand and fingers and the other etc.

Why do we even have this rule anyway?  I can&#x27;t think of the logic 
behind it.  Even being able to start the timer with your palms for 
sport stacking has your hands closer to the cups than if you start 
with fingers but they allow it and it is totally fine.

So why do we have to start and stop with our fingers?  To be honest 
this doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.

I can understand how this might be an issue for the magic, but then 
again sport stacking is just like doing the magic (do the same thing 
every time) and if they allow it why don&#x27;t we?  How is it cheating for 
us and not for them?

Chris

          <div class="email-content">I didn&#x27;t see this post by Ron before posting my other one, but I still 
have more comments.

There was a competitior at the sport stacking championships who had 
his fingers touching the last stack of cups each time he stopped the 
timer with his palms.  The judges noticed this each time he did it and 
disqualified those attempts.

Having seen that they can handle it, why can&#x27;t we train our judges to 
notice if the cuber uses their fingers to manipulate the cubes as they 
stop the timer?

Seriously, if their sport is much harder to judge than ours (it really 
is, by far) then why can&#x27;t we also train our judges to allow 
competitors to stop above the wrist and just watch for if they touch 
the cube as they stop?

I really do not like the stop with the figners rule at all.  Having 
seen that even sport stacking competitions don&#x27;t this rule (much more 
ability to &quot;cheat&quot; by our definition), then really why do we have the 
rule at all for us?  I really want to campaign for us to get rid of 
this rule.

Sorry to be a pain, but I feel very strongly about this issue now.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah I would think the rule about not being able to touch both the 
timer and puzzle at the same time covers the issue.  Although if 
someone were skilled enough I guess they could squeak an extra half-
twist in without the judge noticing.  I always use my fingers on the 
pads anyway-- seems more natural.  Plus it makes better contact so 
you get fewer false starts/stops.

          <div class="email-content">i&#x27;m on board with chris here, i think that finding a good way to stop the timer, as well as getting to puzzle quickly is all part of the strategy for the magic.  obviously the palms are closer to the timer so it just makes sense to use them.  i think that it is totally feasible (especially with magic) for the judges to be able to see if a competitior is touching the puzzle and the timer at the same time.  now if we can just get downi what a true DNF is we will be all set. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Here is a scenario I want you to follow with me.

A person walks up to the timer, does a successful solve but stops the 
timer with their palms.  They do not touch the cube as they stop the 
timer.

This person&#x27;s time should be a DNF and thrown out.  They did not 
successfully solve their cube by competitions standards.  They picked 
up and solve their cube successfully instead of picking up and solving 
their cube &quot;successfully&quot;.

How can that make sense?

Why have we not had a false stop DNF in a tournament yet?  By this 
rule none of my times should count for any tournament I&#x27;ve ever 
competed in.  So why am I still officially ranked?

As much work as it takes to train a judge to look for our current 
rule, you could easily train them to look for whether they touched the 
cube as they stopped the timer with their palms or fingers or whatever.

Imagine the future for cubing.  Some day when our sport takes off we 
could possibly be filmed for TV (maybe ESPN2 will film us one day).  
So now while ESPN if filming someone solve their cube in an awesome 
12.xx seconds on camera, clearly solved (no +2 penalty) and the 
audience goes crazy after seeing the clearly good solve and the fast 
time.  Then the judge throws out the solve because the right hand was 
touching the timer with the top part of the palm.  How can we ever 
convince anyone that that is not a successful solve of a Rubik&#x27;s cube?

This rule hinders the future of our sport&#x27;s credibility.  Take this 
rule to its conclusion in the future.  You could easily have the world 
record solve filmed by a TV company be thrown out because the right 
hand touhed the timer pad with the upper part of the palm.  And by 
this rule that solve had *better* be a DNF, since if you count it you 
undermine the credibility of *all* our records.

Upper part of the palm is not the same as fingers, so if that person&#x27;s 
time is not thrown out as a DNF then we are not a consistent sport and 
don&#x27;t deserve to be filmed.

See what I mean about this rule?

          <div class="email-content">I kinda agree with you, Chris... As long as the competitor is not

I also don&#x27;t see any problems...

no need to tell me, *I* know this... I hope you didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;m 
against it. I&#x27;m somewhat neutral here, seeing reasons both for and

That&#x27;s an easy one to answer:

Because sadly neither you nor your judges knew or cared about the 
rule. Which is my main point.

I think it is good that we are dicussing this rule, because I do <br>
agree, having a rule on the books that is not being enforced is not a <br>
good thing.<br>
<br>
I think we should either<br>
1) train judges to notice whether or not the competitor uses their <br>
fingers to stop the timer on both hands and enforce all DNF <br>
disqualifications on solves where they use their palms with *either* <br>
hand or both.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) Allow the competitiors to stop the timer above the wrist, same as <br>
for sport stacing, and train the judges to notice whether or not the <br>
competitor is touching the puzzle when the time stops.<br>
<br>
I really could not be more against option 1 than I am right now.  If <br>
that is the direction we go in then I think it will change our sport <br>
in a very weird direction.  Think of the implications for future TV <br>
events or for documentaries even.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem I see with option 1 is a judge who is not well <br>
trained.  If they have a world class competitor come up and the world <br>
class competitor actually *does* stop the timer with the upper part of <br>
their palm on their right hand and the judge throws out the solve <br>
don&#x27;t you think the competitor could easily intimidate the judge by <br>
yelling or getting very angry at them?  Maybe the next time the judge <br>
wouldn&#x27;t even call out the competitor even if the competitor did cheat <br>
and use their palm.<br>
<br>
Also what if a judge who is not very competent disqualifies a good <br>
solve that was very close (lower part of the fingers but not the upper <br>
palm).  For close calls like this the WSSA has a video review option <br>
since they film all solves in the final rounds.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll say this, I will stop campaigning for the fingers rule to be <br>
removed if we also film all solves for every competitor in the final <br>
round.  Spotting something like this is very difficult, and even a <br>
judge who is competent could still make mistakes in enforcing this.<br>
<br>
If we include video review and filming of all solves in a final round <br>
I think the fingers rule will be ok, albeit very very weird in my own <br>
personal opinion.<br>
<br>
If we do not include the option to video review a solve that is <br>
questionable then I will be very vocal and adamamantly against the <br>
enforcement of the fingers only stop rule.  What if the judge was paid <br>
off by another competitor to disqualify a high level competitor who <br>
has a shot to win the competition?  How could we protect against this <br>
without video evidence to show that the judge was in fact lying?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

If you are referring to the start of a solve then yes I also think 
that is a bit weird to require a fingers only start.

My question is, what are we trying to prevent by enforcing that?

For sport stacking their times are done by repetition of the same 
sequence, so starting with palms on the timer has your fingers 
closer to the first stack of cups.  And you had better start with 
palms on the timer in a competition if you hope to get the best time 
you can get.  I didn&#x27;t see a single person start with their fingers 
on the timer in any of the higher age divisions, you hurt yourself 
to do that since your hand has to travel further to reach the cups.  
Some people did use the middle of their hands, sort of half palm and 
half fingers, but I didn&#x27;t see anyone choose to use a fingers only 
start.

Now if you started with your palms on the timer and your fingers 
were already touching the cups your judge would be very unhappy with 
you and would force you to stop if you had already started the 
stacking sequence or would not allow you to start if you had not yet 
started.

I&#x27;m asking, what are we preventing by making people start with their 
fingers on the pads?  I mean standardizing the start is one reason 
I&#x27;ve heard.  But do we enforce this rule fully?  How far can the 
competitors push this?  What if I start the timer with the lower 
part of my fingers all the time?  Should the judge DNF my solve if I 
accidently had part of my upper palm touching the timer pad as I 
started?  If so then I would be unhappy if judges didn&#x27;t keep their 
head level with the timer pads to make sure competitiors follow this.

I just wonder that if we keep this rule we make it harder for the 
judges to judge our solves than the sport stackers do.  If by our 
definition they are cheating (their fingers are too close to the 
cups before they start, that&#x27;s what I here is cheating for us) then 
why does every single cup stacker start that way?  Is it cheating if 
everyone does it?

Maybe I&#x27;m not wording this well, but I really don&#x27;t understand this 
rule.  Why is it in place at all?  Or more appropriately what 
situation occured at tournaments or in the planning of tournaments 
that this rule was brought up and implimented?

timing pad so that the puzzle cannot be manipulated at all before the 
timer is started.

This is why I think Generation 2 timers are a problem.

Have the judge watch for that.

I guess I don&#x27;t see why doing that instead is a bad thing, that 
seems like in the long run it would require less training than 
watching exactly where the competitor&#x27;s palm is resting so as to not 
be on the timer pads.  You watch the puzzle (1 thing) rather than 
both palms (two things spread apart).

That&#x27;s very true, paying someone off is a long stretch (I meant it 
to be) but does exist as a problem in all aspects of a competition.

But, the delegate can&#x27;t disqualify two of the 5 solves of a 
competitor&#x27;s final round attempts because they want to.  A judge who 
wanted to by the fingers only stop rule could call 2 of Macky&#x27;s or 
Leyan&#x27;s 5 solves in the final a false palm stop and they would be 
disqualified.  What&#x27;s worse is there there would be no video 
evidence to refute the judge&#x27;s word.  Think of cubing 10 years down 
the line, what if the #2 competitior paid off the judges to 
disqualify the #1 competitor via false stops?  There&#x27;s no video 
evidence to say the judge is not lying...

That far fetched but still possible situation sucks in my opinion.   
How can we get around this situation if the fingers only rule is a 
good one to keep?  My suggestion I think does it well enough, video 
tape all final round solves.  The downside to this is that a new 
world record solve set in the first or second round doesn&#x27;t count 
(same as for sport stacking, an official world record has to be 
captured on video).  But that downside is better than disqualifying 
someone who is fast just because you want to (were paid off or 
whatever).

Why not just allow people to start and stop up to the wrist?  We&#x27;ve 
modeled ourselves after sport stacking in the past, why are we 
changing this one particular rule when the nature of our events are  
similar (do something with the hands as fast as possible).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I see two different situations:
1) competitor stops timer with palms while still doing moves
2) competitor stops timer with palms without still doing moves

In the first case I would give a DNF.
In the second case I would give a warning first, and would give a DNF later in the competition for that competitor.
This is what I have done, even at WC 2005.

Your solution looks simple: just allow to stop with your palms.
But it isn&#x27;t. Even with the best training situation 1 is hard to detect.
Just remember the video of the former Rubik&#x27;s Magic record.

I really do not want video analysis. At least not until we really need it.

I think having two degrees is still the best.
In case of small doubt (palms only) you can give a warning first, in case of serious doubt (palms and possible movements) you can DNF immediately.

Have fun,

Ron

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: starting/stopping the timer


  Hey everyone,

  Here is a scenario I want you to follow with me.

  A person walks up to the timer, does a successful solve but stops the 
  timer with their palms.  They do not touch the cube as they stop the 
  timer.

  This person&#x27;s time should be a DNF and thrown out.  They did not 
  successfully solve their cube by competitions standards.  They picked 
  up and solve their cube successfully instead of picking up and solving 
  their cube &quot;successfully&quot;.

  How can that make sense?

  Why have we not had a false stop DNF in a tournament yet?  By this 
  rule none of my times should count for any tournament I&#x27;ve ever 
  competed in.  So why am I still officially ranked?

  As much work as it takes to train a judge to look for our current 
  rule, you could easily train them to look for whether they touched the 
  cube as they stopped the timer with their palms or fingers or whatever.

  Imagine the future for cubing.  Some day when our sport takes off we 
  could possibly be filmed for TV (maybe ESPN2 will film us one day).  
  So now while ESPN if filming someone solve their cube in an awesome 
  12.xx seconds on camera, clearly solved (no +2 penalty) and the 
  audience goes crazy after seeing the clearly good solve and the fast 
  time.  Then the judge throws out the solve because the right hand was 
  touching the timer with the top part of the palm.  How can we ever 
  convince anyone that that is not a successful solve of a Rubik&#x27;s cube?

  This rule hinders the future of our sport&#x27;s credibility.  Take this 
  rule to its conclusion in the future.  You could easily have the world 
  record solve filmed by a TV company be thrown out because the right 
  hand touhed the timer pad with the upper part of the palm.  And by 
  this rule that solve had *better* be a DNF, since if you count it you 
  undermine the credibility of *all* our records.

  Upper part of the palm is not the same as fingers, so if that person&#x27;s 
  time is not thrown out as a DNF then we are not a consistent sport and 
  don&#x27;t deserve to be filmed.

  See what I mean about this rule?

  Chris

          <div class="email-content">yeah the start especially is easy to govern, in all of these cases i believe it is easier to watch for touching of the puzzle before/after the solve, then trying to see where the hands are on timer.  there have to be better ways to regulate this then by stiffling the technique. i should be able to get as close as possible while still having the timer set as long as i&#x27;m not touching the puzzle, and i should be able to stop the timer with my palms as long as i have finished the final transform.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I just read your report on the sport stacking world championship. Great stuff!

A difference I see is that stacking is done with your hands, whereas cubing can be done with fingers. The movements are much wider and bigger than in speedcubing.
Also the end position of speedstacks is better defined (standing stacks) than in speedcubing (just thrown down your puzzle).
This IMHO makes it harder in speedcubing to detect movements while stopping the timer.

Have fun,

Ron

  Hey everyone,

  Ok I have a question about this now.  I just got back from the sport 
  stacking world championships and they allow their competitors to start 
  and stop the timer anywhere above the wrist.  You can use palms, 
  fingers, palm on one hand and fingers and the other etc.

  Why do we even have this rule anyway?  I can&#x27;t think of the logic 
  behind it.  Even being able to start the timer with your palms for 
  sport stacking has your hands closer to the cups than if you start 
  with fingers but they allow it and it is totally fine.

  So why do we have to start and stop with our fingers?  To be honest 
  this doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.

  I can understand how this might be an issue for the magic, but then 
  again sport stacking is just like doing the magic (do the same thing 
  every time) and if they allow it why don&#x27;t we?  How is it cheating for 
  us and not for them?

&quot;Not easy for judges&quot; is your interpretation. I would have 
said &quot;More fair to competitors&quot;. If we want the times to go down, 
then we could always start with the Magic in the hand and the palms 
on the timer.

No, this has never been brought up for a vote, because there has 
never been a vote at all. Everyone was asked to give feedback on the 
regulations several times in the past. As far as I know noone has 
ever given feedback on this regulation. Last feedback round was in 
January 2006.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">yes but that cross the fine line between touching it and not touching it.  the magic is currently a competition that involves picking it up, transforming it, then setting it down and stopping the timer. actually think that it is very easy for judges to see actually, as well as if there is any fumbling at the end, the magic is such a fast puzzle it should be no problem for the judges to see anything that is unfair and maintain concentraition for the couple seconds it takes.  maybe we should cut everyones fingers down so everyone has the same length and there is no advantage for anyone.  hopefully there will be a feedback session soon, so we can take a group vote or something to find out what the masses think is fair and best.  any other top magicers have an opinions on this? (especially if you are for the rule, in case there is something i&#x27;m not seeing in previous posts supporting the rule)

 regulations several times in the past. As far as I know noone has 
 ever given feedback on this regulation. Last feedback round was in 
 January 2006.
 
 Have fun,
 
 Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

I agree that differentiating situation 1 from situation 2 is hard, but
I think we overestimate how hard that would be.

The judges at the sport stacking event had to watch for corrected
fumbles during a 7-8 second cycle.  *THAT* is hard (trust me I know, I
had to be trained to do it too).   Despite the difficulty they still
trust judges to do it since they are rigorously trained.

If you up stack your 3 then your 6 then your 3 and the top cup of the
6 pyramid falls off, the judge has to determine whether or not the
last 3 pyramid was up stacked or not (if not then it&#x27;s a fumble and
has to be fixed, and if the 3 was finished then it&#x27;s a clean stack
still).  When someone does the cycle in 7 seconds, this particular
situation can all happen in less than 0.10 second.

I think having the judge visually spot whether or not a move is being
done on the cube as the timer is stopped would be no different than
determining if a fumble occurs in the transition from the 3-6-3 into
the 6-6 (the spot where fumbles are hardest to catch).

I wish I could let you guys have seen what this event was like. 
Compared to our judges, sport stacking judges are much more qualified
and have so many more responsibilities.  I think we&#x27;re so used to the
judge not really having to do anything, that the idea of having the
judge spot a complicated situation seems too far fetched, but I assure
you they can do it with some training beforehand.

I still think if a sport stacking judge can spot a fumnle in the 3-6-3
into the 6-6 transition during the cycle, then spotting a move done on
the cube as the timer stops would easily be manageable by a cubing
judge as well.  We just need to train them that their role does not
stop after the person starts solving, they must stay focused on the
cube until the point where it is put down and the timer is stopped.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

I mean this as respectfully as I can, my goal here is not to be a
nuisance but to really bring up an issue I think we are all facing.

I see what you mean about how someone could do a U or U&#x27; trigger while
their palms are still on the timer pads, but I assure you a judge
could notice this.  Again, please see my other post about the
situation a judge faces during a fumble from the 3-6-3 into the 6-6
transition.  If they can spot a fumble there in 0.10 second, I know a
cubing judge could easily watch for a move done before the timer
starts if they are trained to know that this is a situation they
*must* watch for everyone on every solve.  They train all sport
stacking judges to watch the 6 pyramid and the final 3 pyramid during
the 3-6-3 into the 6-6 transition to make sure they catch all the most
likely fumble possibilities.

Also they are farily flexible about the stacks at the end like we are.
 If the stacks are all wobbling and about to topple over as you stop
the timer, but they come to a standing resting state on their own,
that is just as clean of a run as if you stopped and they were all
standing perfectly.

It&#x27;s just like we do it, resting state is all that matters, only for
us the resting state can be on the floor and for them it has to be on
the mat.

I just know that a judge can be trained to see the situations that we
want to avoid with the timer starts and stops, because the job of a
sport stacking judge involves some very intense decisions over
situations that happen very quickly.  All the judges I dealt with were
well trained and comfortable with making these decisions when they
came up.

One of the judges in the final was able to notice that one of the
competitors had his finger on one of the 3 stacks during his stop in
the final rounds.  This is also a fast paced situation, and his
decision proved to be correct based on the video analysis.

I think as long as we include a stricter training regimen for judges,
or a video for them to watch showing what to look for, then we can
avoid the problem situations we want to avoid without having to limit
all competitors by forcing them to start and stop the same way.

Again I mean to disagree as respectfully as I can, but I fully
disagree with how difficult it would be to have a judge watch for
these situations, I think they could easily manage it *IF* we train
them better than we do now.

          <div class="email-content">I think I agree with Chris. As long as the timer
starts/stops without the competitor touching the
puzzle then it shouldn&#x27;t matter how they stop it.

I was curious and looked at the speedstacking rules on
stopping/starting and they state &quot;The timer starts
when the stacker lifts one or both hands from the
touch pads and stops when the stacker places both
hands back on the touch pads (Note:Starting&amp;Stopping
hand positions - A stacker may use any part of the
hand(s)(from below the wrist to the fingertips) on the
touchpad but may not be in contact with any cups....&quot;

I also agree with Chris that it would be very hard to
prove without video of the finishes - especially in
the final round.  Unless there was a seasoned judge in
the area that wasn&#x27;t biased.  Even then you&#x27;d have to
have something to look at if the cuber wanted to
challenge the judges decision.  

Hehe I like Clancy&#x27;s note about chopping everyones
fingers off to make it even - another idea may be (not
as gruesome) is to designate a spot on the mat that
all cubes have to start from - therefore it wouldn&#x27;t
matter if it was a fingertip or palm start/stop. 
Designate a square on the mat (like the square on a
basketball backboard) where the cube must lie within
at the start - an equal distance from the timer for
everyone.

On a side note:
What about one handed solving?  Can a competitor leave
one hand on the touchpads while they cube with the
other?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I agree with you that in the future we should try and improve our 
judging. But this is a matter of time and money. I am happy that the 
regulations are relatively simple and that we can train our 
voluntary judges in a short time frame. I don&#x27;t have the time and 
money to hire judges or professionally train judges.
Judges are still human. Even after a lot of training. Mistakes are 
made. The regulations had better be simple.

I was the judge for the former Magic world record. I am relatively 
well trained, and I only saw the mistake when I rewatched the video. 
You could criticise me for not paying enough attention. But in that 
case you would criticise the average judge in a competition.
I think that would be overreacting to the issue we are now talking 
about.

I do not fully agree about the fumbling. Yes, it would be great if 
an experienced judge would see incorrect fumbling and give a DNF. On 
the other hand it would be really bad if some correct fumbling would 
be given a DNF. My personal feeling in competitions has always been 
that I should be sure before I judge negatively. So I sometimes give 
someone the benefit of the doubt (i.e. give a warning).

Anyway, everyone is free to make a good proposal for upcoming 
versions of the WCA regulations. Criticising is OK, coming with good 
proposals is better.

Have fun,

Ron

Not sure I&#x27;m still in that group, but I like the rule as it is. And 
actually helped making it the way it is particularly because of the 
magic. Using palms, I do not even trust *myself* to not cheat 
(unintentionally, of course).

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hehe I like Clancy&#x27;s note about chopping everyones<br>
&gt; fingers off to make it even - another idea may be (not<br>
&gt; as gruesome) is to designate a spot on the mat that<br>
&gt; all cubes have to start from - therefore it wouldn&#x27;t<br>
&gt; matter if it was a fingertip or palm start/stop. <br>
&gt; Designate a square on the mat (like the square on a<br>
&gt; basketball backboard) where the cube must lie within<br>
&gt; at the start - an equal distance from the timer for<br>
&gt; everyone.<br>
<br>
This I like a lot, this could really resolve a lot of issues.<br>
<br>
When starting, have a sqaure set up on the mat (marked in tape) and NO<br>
part of the hand may touch the line of the square or be inside it. <br>
You could start with palms or fingers, as long as your hand is not<br>
inside the square.<br>
<br>
When finishing you put down the cube and stop the timer any way you<br>
like.  If your hand is touching the cube as you stop the timer than<br>
that solve is a DNF (same if you have a hand on the cups when you stop<br>
in stacking).<br>
<br>
This would be easy for the judges, only at the end of the solve must<br>
they watch to make sure the hands do not touch the cube as the timer<br>
stops.<br>
<br>
For the beginning, any possiblity of cheating is relieved by the start<br>
sqaure.<br>
<br>
The only thing we would have to decide is a good position of the<br>
square to accomodate both children and adults.<br>
<br>
Perhaps just a few centimeters away from the actual timer itself and<br>
in the center?  This means that most likely you would have to start<br>
with fingers anyway, but if you can wrap your hands around the square<br>
as long as you are not within the square things would be ok.<br>
<br>
The square itself could be done with thin tape applied to the mat, so<br>
as not to damage it or mark it for when we send them back to<br>
speedstacks, and the dimensions could be just just a few millimeters<br>
larger than the largest puzzle (5x5x5 cube I would guess).<br>
<br>
We could also designate the bottom line of the square (the one closest<br>
to the timer) as the no pass line for magicing.<br>
<br>
If you fingers pass that line it is an illegal start, but if not then<br>
you can start however you want as long as fingers don&#x27;t cross the line.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?<br>

I dare to claim if someone does the cycle in 7 seconds then there was 
no such mistake :-)

Where&#x27;s your report that Ron mentioned?

Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
Yeah to get a 7 second cycle those people had a pretty much flawless<br>
execution, but a few of the really fast people did still get 8.xx<br>
seconds with a fumble.  It was absolutely crazy to watch, kind of like<br>
Macky&#x27;s sub-20 pop solve in competition; it just blew everyone away.<br>
<br>
The fastest cycle time I heard of at the tournament was a 6.70 done<br>
during warmups.  So their records still have a long way to go, a lot<br>
of people have beaten Emily&#x27;s 7.43 record unofficially, but none have<br>
done it officially yet.  Kind of like our 9&#x27;s in the UWR list but<br>
11.13 is the official record.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Where&#x27;s your report that Ron mentioned?<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I sent an e-mail to the WCA board members about my experience there as<br>
it relates to cubing tournaments.  I still plan on writing a report<br>
about my experience there in general.  It was a very awesome event,<br>
and I highly recommend anyone who is interested in stacking try a<br>
local tournament if you get the chance, it was an absolute blast!<br>
<br>
Stefan, if you get a chance you should talk to some of the guys on the<br>
German team.  A few of them know of you already through Boris Konrad<br>
and blindfolded cubing.  Also Dennis Schleussner is a world class<br>
yo-yo person and he knew of you too.<br>
<br>
Those guys were really cool, I had a chance to hang out with them<br>
some.  If you&#x27;re still interested in stacking you should look them up,<br>
they were very nice people and very fun to hang out with.<br>

1) We want to make sure there&#x27;s no move done before the timer starts
or after the timer stops.
2) If I control the pads with my wrists, I can execute the whole solve
without starting the timer. If I control the pads with my wrists, I
can still make moves after the timer stops.
3) Controling the pads with fingers prevents people from cheating,
intentionaly or not.

Of course, when the competitor stops the timer with his wrists/palms
and the puzzle is 31.41 centimeters away, there&#x27;s no reason for
disqualification. We should make the rule more clear about this point.

On your page
(http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/competitiontutorial.html) you show 2
videos of solves. On both of them, you stop the timer with the cube
under your fingers! Video analyzis only can tell if you&#x27;re cheating or
not. I think a juge should warn you the first time. And the next time,
you should stop the timer with your fingers, or end with the cube far
away, unless you want to risk DNF.

By the way, I wanted an even more standardized way of starting, with a
minimum distance between fingers and the puzzle. The others decided is
wasn&#x27;t required.

That&#x27;s not a &quot;could&quot;, that&#x27;s a &quot;must&quot;. And not just for magic. 
Otherwise you could start with your fingers around the square and the 
judge says &quot;ok&quot; and then you move your fingers into the square by 
rotating your hands and *before* leaving the sensors.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I have the perfect solution to this.<br>
<br>
Frank&#x27;s times were not counted as official because of a mistake I made <br>
at the competition.  Frank didn&#x27;t register until late and so I guess it <br>
was my fault that I didn&#x27;t have advance warning that he was coming and <br>
didn&#x27;t squeeze in the 5x5x5 round appropriately.  I guess it&#x27;s also my <br>
fault that I cut some 4x4x4 solves out of the competition just so that <br>
Frank would have time to solve the 5x5x5.  It&#x27;s also my fault that I <br>
scrapped the 2x2x2 in favor of the 5x5x5 because Frank is very good at <br>
that event.<br>
<br>
In the end, there was a mixup with the regulations and it&#x27;s completely <br>
my fault that Frank&#x27;s times didn&#x27;t count.  The simple solution will be <br>
to not do a 5x5x5 event at my competitions, because I&#x27;m sick of people <br>
like you complaining and whining about every little thing, when I <br>
actually go through extra efforts in an attempt to accommodate Frank&#x27;s <br>
presence at the competition.<br>

I remember that one of the main reasons why the WCA refused to give
Eric Johanson&#x27;s timer (http://www.mission-designs.com/timer) a chance
was because of the &quot;free move&quot; possibility. Stackmats were supposed to
make such a cheat impossible.

Hearing now that the judge should make a decision based on visual
criteria is very amusing.

   Actually, I have the perfect solution to this.
 
 Frank&#x27;s times were not counted as official because of a mistake I made 
 at the competition.  Frank didn&#x27;t register until late and so I guess it 
 was my fault that I didn&#x27;t have advance warning that he was coming and 
 didn&#x27;t squeeze in the 5x5x5 round appropriately.  I guess it&#x27;s also my 
 fault that I cut some 4x4x4 solves out of the competition just so that 
 Frank would have time to solve the 5x5x5.  It&#x27;s also my fault that I 
 scrapped the 2x2x2 in favor of the 5x5x5 because Frank is very good at 
 that event.
 
 In the end, there was a mixup with the regulations and it&#x27;s completely 
 my fault that Frank&#x27;s times didn&#x27;t count.  The simple solution will be 
 to not do a 5x5x5 event at my competitions, because I&#x27;m sick of people 
 like you complaining and whining about every little thing, when I 
 actually go through extra efforts in an attempt to accommodate Frank&#x27;s 
 presence at the competition.

    Yea he is the main person that needs to know but
at the same time what about the people who wonder and
just want to ask? You could of simply said something
to the effect of &quot;the WCA board spoke with Frank about
the situation and he understands the reasoning...blah
blah blah&quot;

   I&#x27;m not saying it matters if I agree or not,
obviously it is my opinion that is all. 
   You are right, I don&#x27;t have anything to do with
that record.  I didn&#x27;t set it.  But what if I had (in
like a million years). What if I had been the one that
set a new record and then had it taken away.  I would
want some public explaination about the whole thing. 
Since I see the final results of the competition and
the 2006 official records - I guess I was just asking
for an explaination.  I have heard several
answers/rumors about it but thought I&#x27;d ask the ones
who knew -which in this case is you all.
    I don&#x27;t believe if I have competed in a 5x5
competition is relevant here.

  I can say that was a thoughtful and generous
gesture. Attempting to bend and be flexible enough to
attempt to allow a 5x5 is awesome coordination on your
part  I&#x27;m not saying you didn&#x27;t try.  But at the same
time, since he registered late - why punish the rest
of the competitors who registered on time by scrapping
or shortening the other events? Granted if someone is
very good at an event and they register late, whose
fault is that? If someone registers late can they
request an event be added? Just like college, if you
register late for classes - you have to settle with
what is available.

>In the end, there was a mixup with the regulations

   And in the end that is all I needed to hear.  Just
a simple reason for the discrepancy.

   Hey if you wish to not hold 5x5 competitions that
is your perogative.  You have been doing competitions
for a while now and with the popularity of the puzzle
there are going to be certain things or aspects that
need to change.  They are your competitions and you
can do what you want.
   If you took my curiosity as &quot;whining and
complaining&quot; that is all you. All I asked was a
question and you apparently felt personally attacked
-which of course was not my intent.  I admire the fact
that you attempting to work in an event for someone
who is good at it.
   As for &quot;people like me&quot; some of us are born to ask
questions and figure out the how, why things are the
way they are.  If I have a question, I am going to ask
it, I&#x27;m not going to sit and just wonder, not my
style.  You don&#x27;t have to like me or &quot;people like me&quot;
- such is life, I am sure everyone feels that way
towards someone at one point or another.

    Again that is all that needed to be said &quot;We
underestimated the number of participants at the
Exploratorium.  Our mistake&quot; I just wanted an
explaination.
   As for accusing anyone of being dishonest...to me
changing the results of anything without an
explaination - either to the public or a side note on
the bottom of the final results page seems a little
sneaky - like something was trying to be avoided
(perhaps an email string like this).

&quot;Hope you have the time of your life&quot; - GD

          <div class="email-content">     I have a say on this topic, as I experienced something in WC2005 that relates to this issue.  When walking up to the timer, I put my hands on the timer as usual (like I always and usually do), and the judge did the following:
  1) Put my fingers on the pads AND
  2) Placed the cube _away_ from my fingers.  there is no way I can prove distance between the cube and my fingers in this post, but there lies an issue in this principle.
       This issue on &quot;starting&quot; and &quot;stopping&quot; the timer DOES need to be defined, and I completely agree with Chris on this.  The &quot;minimal distance between pad and cube&quot; and &quot;taped square&quot; where the cube should be are all good ideas.
       As long as your not touching the cube, starting the timer and stopping the timer should not matter at all- the ideal is to solve the cube, not deal with such matters as &quot;how our hands should be placed.&quot;  With hundreds of people competing nowadays, this can be a weird thing to regulate through the judges- and like Ron said, costs $ to train such judges to watch for this.
       In conclusion, the whole point boils down to this: we, the cubing community, need a new timer.  A new timer would define such a situation enough to resolve this problem.  
       Though, I believe a defined set of rules, such as &quot;minimal distance from the touch-pads&quot; or &quot;cube in a particular square&quot; is good, in addition to using hands/palms of course (or using hands on the pads in any way you wish).  I will continue this in the WCA forum.  These are just my two cents...  Thanks,

   Sure, we screwed up.  We underestimated the number of participants at 
 the Exploratorium.  Again, our mistake.  What more do you want?  We try 
 our hardest, and things don&#x27;t happen every time.  There&#x27;s no reason to 
 accuse anyone of dishonesty.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think anyone would ever even *try* to cheat in this manner... not if judges were trained to look for it.
   
  No world class cubist would risk it (assuming a raised awareness), and they are the only ones where the extra 0.10 second would actually matter.
   
  If judges were trained to look for this, not only would they probably become more qualified, but it would act as a deterent and the problem would probably never happen in the first place.
   
  Quite frankly I don&#x27;t really care, b/c a fraction of a second has never meant much to me, but i know for some people, this time does matter.

Hey Stefan,

Yeah to get a 7 second cycle those people had a pretty much flawless
execution, but a few of the really fast people did still get 8.xx
seconds with a fumble.  It was absolutely crazy to watch, kind of like
Macky&#x27;s sub-20 pop solve in competition; it just blew everyone away.

The fastest cycle time I heard of at the tournament was a 6.70 done
during warmups.  So their records still have a long way to go, a lot
of people have beaten Emily&#x27;s 7.43 record unofficially, but none have
done it officially yet.  Kind of like our 9&#x27;s in the UWR list but
11.13 is the official record.

I sent an e-mail to the WCA board members about my experience there as
it relates to cubing tournaments.  I still plan on writing a report
about my experience there in general.  It was a very awesome event,
and I highly recommend anyone who is interested in stacking try a
local tournament if you get the chance, it was an absolute blast!

Stefan, if you get a chance you should talk to some of the guys on the
German team.  A few of them know of you already through Boris Konrad
and blindfolded cubing.  Also Dennis Schleussner is a world class
yo-yo person and he knew of you too.

Those guys were really cool, I had a chance to hang out with them
some.  If you&#x27;re still interested in stacking you should look them up,
they were very nice people and very fun to hang out with.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">I feel kind of obligated to post my thoughts here....although, I am a little apprehensive since I can only imagine all of the retorts I will recieve.
   
  When I found out that I would be able to go to the comp in January, I asked for a 5x5 event, with full belief that there would not be one.  I know it isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s favorite event, and I know that a big turnout was expected.  However, I believe that it never hurts to ask.  Luckily, Tyson worked hard to fit an event in for me, and made other sacrifices as well.  Next time I won&#x27;t ask if I am coming to an event on short notice.  My fault.
   
  Do I agree with the ruling?  No.  However, I know that fighting it was a losing battle, and I made a statement off the top of my head which helps that battle.  I respect the WCA board and will just let it go.  Am I still bitter?  Yes.  I won&#x27;t lie, it sucks.  However, I know that there are other opportunities to compete, and possibly to better than I did in January.  
   
  Let&#x27;s just drop this before anymore is said here.  If you want to bash on what I have said here, send me a personal email.  The harsh words, sarcasm and all the bullshit may make some people not want to ask questions.  I know I am hesitant sometimes.
   
  In the meantime, I will just be busting my ass on the 5x5.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Christy that this is relevant to the community and a 
lot of us are curious about it.  At a minimum, it should be a 
learning opportunity for others who try to organize tournaments so 
that they are cognizant of some of the more obscure (and 
questionable) rules of the WCA.  This mistake shouldn&#x27;t happen again 
if people are informed, but if no one mentions it, the mistakes of 
history are doomed to be repeated.

But don&#x27;t beat yourself up, Tyson; it&#x27;s one mistake, and after all 
you have done, I think you&#x27;re entitled to make a mistake or two.  We 
all make mistakes.  I don&#x27;t think anyone was attacking you or 
complaining about your efforts; we all should be very grateful for 
all you have done to promote cubing -- from tournaments to tv and 
everything in between -- (I know I am).  

But open and frank dialog (no pun intended) is good for the 
community, and may ensure that no one else has to go through what 
Frank had to go through.  

Happy cubing,

--Kirk

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
I have a question for the fast 4x4x4 cubers. How long do you need to<br>
solve the centers and pairing up the edges for the 4x4x4?<br>
<br>
Today I took a (rolling) average for this. The times were:<br>
32.92 36.13 46.87 32.87 36.06 36.66 (1:01.40) 34.59 35.54 36.99<br>
(30.51) 32.74 ==&gt; 36.14 seconds<br>
<br>
(The 46.87 and 1:01.40 was because I made a mistake.)<br>
<br>
For pairing up the edges I used this method: I solve the first six<br>
pairs at once. After this I (usually) do four pairs at once. And then<br>
the last two pairs if necessary.<br>

  About two months ago, I started feeling pains in my right thumb,
directly after playing with my EXTREMELY stiff Rubik&#x27;s 5*5*5. It
didn&#x27;t go away, so I had a break from cubing for 3-4 weeks. Then I
started practicing for the Swedish cube competition. I can still feel
it every once in a while, but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was. I usually
feel it while cubing, so I don&#x27;t practice as much now as I did before.
After German Open I&#x27;m thinking of tkeing a break for a month or so to
see if it dissappears, so I can tart training for the European
Championships.

  Not at all, I took a picture from several angles, that cube is really on 
  the facade of the European Champs venue. We&#x27;ve been dreaming about 
  customizing it for the champs, but I doubt they let us do it.

Your cross will be fixed and you can continue with the last layer.

I don&#x27;t think anyone would ever even *try* to cheat in this manner... not if
judges were trained to look for it.
   
  No world class cubist would risk it (assuming a raised awareness), and
they are the only ones where the extra 0.10 second would actually matter.
   
  If judges were trained to look for this, not only would they probably
become more qualified, but it would act as a deterent and the problem would
probably never happen in the first place.
   
  Quite frankly I don&#x27;t really care, b/c a fraction of a second has never
meant much to me, but i know for some people, this time does matter.

Hey Stefan,

Yeah to get a 7 second cycle those people had a pretty much flawless
execution, but a few of the really fast people did still get 8.xx
seconds with a fumble.  It was absolutely crazy to watch, kind of like
Macky&#x27;s sub-20 pop solve in competition; it just blew everyone away.

The fastest cycle time I heard of at the tournament was a 6.70 done
during warmups.  So their records still have a long way to go, a lot
of people have beaten Emily&#x27;s 7.43 record unofficially, but none have
done it officially yet.  Kind of like our 9&#x27;s in the UWR list but
11.13 is the official record.

I sent an e-mail to the WCA board members about my experience there as
it relates to cubing tournaments.  I still plan on writing a report
about my experience there in general.  It was a very awesome event,
and I highly recommend anyone who is interested in stacking try a
local tournament if you get the chance, it was an absolute blast!

Stefan, if you get a chance you should talk to some of the guys on the
German team.  A few of them know of you already through Boris Konrad
and blindfolded cubing.  Also Dennis Schleussner is a world class
yo-yo person and he knew of you too.

Those guys were really cool, I had a chance to hang out with them
some.  If you&#x27;re still interested in stacking you should look them up,
they were very nice people and very fun to hang out with.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bernett,<br>
<br>
Thanks, I am sure we will have a lot of fun over there!<br>
<br>
Of course I am practicing more than average shortly before a competition. But I am also busy with the preparation of the competition itself. A lot of small things still need to be done. In the past I tried to mentally prepare for competitions. Now I do not do anything anymore. When I am on stage I just try to feel like I am at home on the sofa.<br>
<br>
It is now around 10-12 degrees Celsius around here during day time.<br>
The competition hall has the size of a basketball hall. At the back is a large starge, in the front we will have the tables for puzzle market.<br>
You can find information on the registrations at http://www.speedcubing.com/events/gcd2006. 49 competitors from 10 countries. 32 people in 4x4x4!<br>
When you check the list you can see the favorites for each event.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>
Ron<br>
<br>

  Wow! 32 for 444 and 22 for 555 and 19 for 333 bld are registered. It is going to be all fun there. I will be missing everything!

          <div class="email-content">I, myself, practice a lot on 222, 333 of course and 333 one-handed.
The other events I practice a little but my focus is on those three
events. I&#x27;m hoping to do a great average for 222, unless I din&#x27;t get
to nervous.

Most of the french cubers are going to the french championships, so I
guess my money is on Joël van Norrt for the main event, but there are
a lot of fast cubers. My goal is to get to the finals.

Finnish record is about -55, I think.
Here +16 celsius is warm.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I have one.  At least I have one that appears identical to that

And no, they are terrible for speedcubing.  It&#x27;s a shame because the 
centers have arches and the plastic is nice and soft.  But there is 
no way to get the proper tension due to lack of springs/screws.

to wish everyone good luck. May everyone fulfill their wishes in this
competition. Lets see some more records broken this time :-)

As mentioned in the rules, the first three qualifying guys will have
the honour to send me cubes of their liking. My address will be given
to them later :P

I took an average and here was the result..  

(36.78), 41.20, 42.97, 39.32, 40.10, 41.18, 40.32, 44.78, 39.01,

I guess I have a long way to go.

  Hi Michael,

I took an average and here was the result..  

(36.78), 41.20, 42.97, 39.32, 40.10, 41.18, 40.32, 44.78, 39.01,

I guess I have a long way to go.

  I find, not only Annssi is pre-registered but also no one from France pre-registered. In such case I bet on Joel/Ron.
     
    Wow! 32 for 444 and 22 for 555 and 19 for 333 bld are registered. It is going to be all fun there. I will be missing everything!
     
    Thanks Ron uncle, for all your informations. I will be right there in the hall  with you all mentally, but you all could not see me!!!!!

          <div class="email-content">Usually, when you start off with the Fridrich method, you should do a
&quot;slow cross&quot;, this allows you to search for the pair while forming the
cross. As you do this more and more, you&#x27;ll starting picking it up
sooner. It&#x27;ll all come with time and practice.

Well, I have to say that after all the flame wars back and forth on topics like this (B final, 
tiering, age divisions, etc), you guys found a very reasonable way to do it: &quot;Didn&#x27;t make

Well done - looks like it was a great competition,

Now, all I need is an &quot;Old Folks&quot; category and I&#x27;ll have two chances for some glory.

Also, nice job on recognition of top under-15 solvers with the prizes.

Excellent! I&#x27;ll block it out on the calendar right now.

Uh oh - did I promise to consider making some sort of show? Darn me and my foolish

  I find, not only Annssi is pre-registered but also no one from France pre-registered. In such case I bet on Joel/Ron.
     
    Wow! 32 for 444 and 22 for 555 and 19 for 333 bld are registered. It is going to be all fun there. I will be missing everything!

          <div class="email-content">Hi All --<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve had a minor calamity with my megaminx, and could use a couple <br>
pointers in the right direction.<br>
<br>
I have a 12-color tiled megaminx, and the tiles fall off with some <br>
regularity (i&#x27;m an ape with my turning style). So, I usually glue <br>
them back on and all is fine.<br>
<br>
Well, I was gluing on a tile (using Krazy Glue) and the glue was <br>
warmer than I thought it was so it *shot* out of the bottle, went <br>
right onto the Megaminx, and started seeping in the cracks between <br>
faces!<br>
<br>
Panicked, I quickly turned it upside down and sopped up as much glue <br>
as I could but I wasn&#x27;t fast enough. As a result, three cubies (a <br>
corner and two edges) are currently *cemented* to a center.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently planning on trying to saw through the cement with a <br>
scalpel or razor blade, but I realize it would be easier if the <br>
Megaminx was taken apart (at least partially). However, I can&#x27;t find <br>
disassembly instructions. <br>
<br>
I found Grant and Jaap&#x27;s web pages with solutions, I found Stefan&#x27;s <br>
web page with various puzzle disassembly instructions (but no <br>
megaminx) and I found the speedcubing records for assembly (implying <br>
that Stefan and Parker have taken one apart). Alas, no posted <br>
disassembly instructions.<br>
<br>
If someone could send me a link or some instructions, I&#x27;d greatly <br>
appreciate it! My email is yeff@....<br>

I&#x27;m definitely not one of the &quot;best&quot; cubists, but I average slightly 
under 35 seconds. Cross/F2L takes a little under 20 seconds, my 4-
step LL takes about 10-15 seconds.

Overall move count is 70-80, split up as 40 for Cross/F2L and 30-40 
for 4-step LL.

LL specifics: Method is Orient Edges, Permute Corners, Orient 
Corners, Permute Edges; Worst case move count for LL would be about 
50 (longest algs, quarter turn measurement); worst case time would 
be about 17 seconds (longest algs, no mistakes).

  Hi All --

I&#x27;ve had a minor calamity with my megaminx, and could use a couple 
pointers in the right direction.

I have a 12-color tiled megaminx, and the tiles fall off with some 
regularity (i&#x27;m an ape with my turning style). So, I usually glue 
them back on and all is fine.

Well, I was gluing on a tile (using Krazy Glue) and the glue was 
warmer than I thought it was so it *shot* out of the bottle, went 
right onto the Megaminx, and started seeping in the cracks between 
faces!

Panicked, I quickly turned it upside down and sopped up as much glue 
as I could but I wasn&#x27;t fast enough. As a result, three cubies (a 
corner and two edges) are currently *cemented* to a center.

I&#x27;m currently planning on trying to saw through the cement with a 
scalpel or razor blade, but I realize it would be easier if the 
Megaminx was taken apart (at least partially). However, I can&#x27;t find 
disassembly instructions. 

I found Grant and Jaap&#x27;s web pages with solutions, I found Stefan&#x27;s 
web page with various puzzle disassembly instructions (but no 
megaminx) and I found the speedcubing records for assembly (implying 
that Stefan and Parker have taken one apart). Alas, no posted 
disassembly instructions.

If someone could send me a link or some instructions, I&#x27;d greatly 
appreciate it! My email is yeff@....

Shame that it takes you over a minute to do LL...Or did you mean 7-8 
seconds? :-)

Me, I&#x27;m around 20-25 seconds.  F2L is usually 15-16 seconds, LL 7-9 
seconds.

Did an average of 10 for each:
F2L
Average: 15.84 seconds
Individual Times: 15.08, 18.94, (11.90), 14.40, 14.41, 12.39, 17.82, 
17.83, 15.75, 19.10, 12.68, (22.90)

LL
Average: 07.75 seconds
Individual Times: 08.71, 08.35, 07.79, (09.29), 09.06, 07.96, 
(05.53), 07.96, 05.96, 06.98, 07.21, 07.48

So I seriously need to work on F2L.  I get sub-15 F2L if I don&#x27;t 
hesitate or mess up.  In other words, I messed up and/or hesitated 
on nearly every F2L solve.  That sup-20 was pathetic.  Screwed up 
the cross, put the wrong corner in the first F2L slot...bleagh.

LL.  You can see the breakdown on the subtitles on this clip:

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,

Have a great time at the German Comp this weekend. I would be going too
if the date didn&#x27;t clash with my brother&#x27;s wedding! So instead, I&#x27;m now
sitting at Heathrow airport waiting for my flight to Australia. I&#x27;ll be
back in the UK next month, but unfortunately not in time for the Belgium
comp, so I&#x27;ll miss that too! I think I&#x27;ll probably be able to make it to
the Dutch Open though, so maybe I&#x27;ll see you all in The Netherlands
later this year. :)

Hey, that worked!

Popping an edge was my first thought, but the Megaminx was a little 
resistant so I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was the case. Spurred on by 
Frank&#x27;s endorsement, I put more force into it and it worked just 
fine.

Thanks, Frank!

ps - and yes, I&#x27;ll be more careful with the Krazy Glue in the future.

<br>
On the back of a recent issue of The New Yorker, there&#x27;s an American <br>
Express ad featuring M. Night Shyamalan (director of &quot;Sixth <br>
Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, etc).<br>
<br>
The ad consists of a picture of Shyamalan, along with his apparently <br>
handwritten responses to various questions.<br>
<br>
To the question of &quot;Childhood Ambition&quot;, his response is &quot;Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube champion.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can see the ad at the URL: <br>
http://www.mylifemycard.com/mylifemycard.html. In the picture box at <br>
the lower middle, move the mouse to the sides until you see a guy <br>
sitting at a chair with a pad in his lap (his signature will be on <br>
the right). Click on the picture to bring up the ad.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kelly,

First of all, you should look for a piece that is in the D layer (the 
last layer), that has to go to the middle layer. Look what colors that 
piece has. In the example, red blue is chosen, so the cube is rotated 
with red to the left, and blue to the front. But if the piece you 
found is blue/orange, you have to rotate, so the blue center (the blue 
face) is at the left, and orange is on the front. Then rotate that 
piece in the D layer under it&#x27;s corresponding center (so the colors 
match). The T pattern can be on the LEFT face, in that case, D L D&#x27; L&#x27; 
D&#x27; F&#x27; D F will solve the edge piece to the middle layer. If the T 
pattern is on the FRONT face, D&#x27; F&#x27; D F D L D&#x27; L&#x27; will bring the piece 
to the middle layer.

Also read the part about &quot;What if the edge piece is not in the last 
layer?&quot; on the website!

If you still have difficulties, try my website:

http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/index.php?location=tutorial1

I think this tutorial is quite beginner friendly...

          <div class="email-content">Sorry, the last part has gone wrong.. It should be:

The T pattern can be on the FRONT face, in that case, D L D&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; 
F&#x27; D F will solve the edge piece to the middle layer. If the T 
pattern is on the LEFT face, D&#x27; F&#x27; D F D L D&#x27; L&#x27; will bring the 
piece to the middle layer.

It&#x27;s because of the L and F faces that are used, instead of F and 
R.. Why Jasmine..? :p

Is there any particular strategy people use?  To me, it would seem

uses this approach, but I like it.<br>
<br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/28011<br>
NEw 4x4 approach?<br>
<br>
BASICALLY:<br>
1. 4x3x1 block<br>
2. 5 centers<br>
3. pair up 9 edges<br>
4. finish with a roux solve (35 moves w/o accounting for parities)<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been using this and have done pretty well with it.  I always<br>
start with the same 4x3x1 block (white/orange),  which makes center<br>
recognition easier (I do Green, Red, Orange, Blue).  I pair up 6 edges<br>
and then pair up 3more to make the 3x3.  I can do the edges very fast<br>
now.  I waste a lot of time on building the block (30s?) and a lot of<br>
time on the centers (20s?)<br>

THIS method doesn&#x27;t require that you do the centers and then pair up<br>
edges.  The Idea instead is to do the corners first, and then do<br>
centers and edges simultaneously at the end.<br>
<br>
THE 4x4 is my new favorite cube.  It can be a 4x4, a 3x3 or a 2x2. <br>
Usually we transform a scrambled 4x4 into a scrambled 3x3.  WHy not<br>
instead transform the scrambled 4x4 into a scrambled 2x2?<br>
<br>
You would have to look at each corner as its own entity, and try to<br>
link 3 edges and 3 centers to each corner.  If this can be<br>
successfully done, then you are left with nothing but a 2x2. 20 moves<br>
 is a lot better than 55...<br>
Orientation parity can&#x27;t occur. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the permutation<br>
parity would come up either.<br>
<br>
If I can take a New 4x4 and scramble it into a 2x2, and then scramble<br>
it into randomness...  DOes it stand to reason that I should be able<br>
to do these steps in reverse order?<br>
<br>
Is this a possible method?<br>
Has anyone else tried this?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I can do a complete first layer in sub 15 secs on a good day. So a 
good target for the 4x3x1 block is maybe 12 secs. Note that u will 
probably be slower cause u have to be selective what pieces u solve, 
whereas while doing a complete layer there is more freedom in how to 
solve the various cubies :-)

Regarding orientation parity it depends on what u have to preserve. 
For a pure version check out the ones on Stefan Pochmanns site:

http://www.stefan-
pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/4x4_5x5_algs/#FixOrientationParity

Good luck !!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I also had ur idea at some point a few yrs ago. Around the same time 
i developed my cage-system. 

There are a few reasons why i think it won&#x27;t work well: 

- There will be more parts to &quot;line up&quot; than for any other system. 
One will have to line up 8 corner-2x2x2-blocks as well as 12 2x2-
edges. I can&#x27;t see how this will be possible without very 
problematic recognition. I see this approach to be interesting 
mostly from a theoretical point of view. 

- I also think there will be a slightly problematic parity issue 
with such a method. Normal parity fix will either completely ignore 
centers (as for my cage method) or be based upon preserving the 
centers. With the proposed method neither is really feasible :-o

There might exist slight adjustments to this approach that will 
_solve_ the above mentioned problems ... :-)

Let me know if this approach leads to something interesting :D

Kind regards,

          <div class="email-content">Rutgers will be hosting its Spring 2006 tournament on Saturday, April<br>
29, 2006 at Rutgers University.  The tournament will run from 10am -<br>
4:30pm and registration will be from 9am - 10am.  Admission is free<br>
and there is a rumor that there MAY be free pizza (depends on how much<br>
money is left over).  The competition will be held at Scott Hall, Room<br>
123 on the College Ave Campus on College Avenue itself (it is between<br>
Seminary Place and Hamilton Street).  I know where it is, so if you<br>
need directions, e-mail me.  The events include 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 3x3<br>
one-handed, 3x3 blindfold, magic, and master magic (though 5x5 will be<br>
the first to be dropped if there are time constraints).  You may<br>
pre-register (this will save you time on competition day) by e-mailing<br>
me with your Name, Country of representation (if not USA) and events<br>
you are participating in.  My e-mail address is bob@....  If<br>
you have any questions, e-mail me.<br>

  How long do I need to break the cube in? a week? 2? a month?

  I like to assemble as follows:

1. Put the springs on the screws, followed by the washer.  Make the 
flat side of the washer face the spring.  Insert the 
screw/spring/washer into the center.  Do that for all six.

2. Using a screwdriver, push the screw all the way into one of the 
centers (compressing the spring all the way), then screw it into the 
burr.  Make sure you screw it in as straight as possible.  Stop when 
you get about 0.5 mm from the burr.  Do that for all six.

3. Assemble the edges and corners to complete the cube.

4. Cut six square pieces of paper the same size as the center (use 
the center caps to trace the outline onto paper before cutting).  
Lay each square so it covers the center.  It should rest neatly 
between the surrounding four edge pieces.  Mash the cap onto the 
center, deforming the paper as you press it in.  The tension will 
keep the cap in place nicely.  Do that for all six.

5. Break the cube in before lubing, to remove any stray plastic 
shavings.  Don&#x27;t worry if it feels too tight.

6. Turn two adjacent faces a tiny bit, to create an opening near a 
center.  Drop a few drops of silicone oil into the opening, then 
scramble the cube thoroughly.  Careful not to get the paper pieces 
wet (replace them if they do).

7. Adjust the tension by temporarily removing the center caps and 
loosening each screw the same amount.

8. Sticker and enjoy!

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

One should of course inspect each cubie carefully before assembling 
the DIY. Molding imperfections and such should be removed with a 
sharp knife/stanley or something. Also all tuning of tension should 
be done before attaching the centercaps.

Cheers!

  you said to stop when you have 0.5mm from the burr, and after lubing, loose each screw the same amount...is that really necessary? isn&#x27;t it better to adjust the tension at the beggining?

          <div class="email-content">Hmm...I didn&#x27;t really check all the cubies...but yeah, I still didn&#x27;t attach the centercaps...I&#x27;ll just do that when the tension is nice

Per Kristen Fredlund &lt;aspiring_to_love@...> escreveu:
  Hi :-)

One should of course inspect each cubie carefully before assembling 
the DIY. Molding imperfections and such should be removed with a 
sharp knife/stanley or something. Also all tuning of tension should 
be done before attaching the centercaps.

Cheers!

that for example, the edge piece with the worn red is the red/yellow<br>
cubie. This may help looking ahead during f2l. This does not really<br>
affect me because I use Cubesmith stickers which don&#x27;t really come<br>

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s a WCA regulation that says that the color of the sticker is the 
only thing that is supposed to distinguish different pieces.

This is why you can&#x27;t mix black cubes and white cubes and also why most 
people have to replace their stickers before entering a competition.

          <div class="email-content">True, but if you use a Rubik&#x27;s Game or Deluxe cube from the 80&#x27;s, 
the tiles stick out so far that you can see the &quot;far side&quot; of pieces 
if the cube is at the right angle.  I guess in the end, it doesn&#x27;t 
matter too much since all the fastest guys can mentally &quot;see&quot; and 
deduce what color must be on the back side of an edge, etc.  I&#x27;m 
getting to the point where I can do it near the end of the F2L quite 
easily.

On a similar note, I&#x27;m surprised no one has ever complained about 
the use of flourescent orange stickers (whether 80&#x27;s, Studio, or 
Cubesmith).  These have a distinctly different feel from the other 5 
vinyl colors, and that could theoretically aid in blindfolded 
solving.

  True, but if you use a Rubik&#x27;s Game or Deluxe cube from the 80&#x27;s, 
the tiles stick out so far that you can see the &quot;far side&quot; of pieces 
if the cube is at the right angle.  I guess in the end, it doesn&#x27;t 
matter too much since all the fastest guys can mentally &quot;see&quot; and 
deduce what color must be on the back side of an edge, etc.  I&#x27;m 
getting to the point where I can do it near the end of the F2L quite 
easily.

On a similar note, I&#x27;m surprised no one has ever complained about 
the use of flourescent orange stickers (whether 80&#x27;s, Studio, or 
Cubesmith).  These have a distinctly different feel from the other 5 
vinyl colors, and that could theoretically aid in blindfolded 
solving.

Winning Moves was the organizer of this championship, with the
assistance of Seven Towns.
I helped a bit, and thanks to those who volunteered for the scrambles!

I guess Olivier and Frédérick will give their best at the European
Championship in September.

By the way, Dave Jones and Thierry Karpiel confirmed we are going here:

Official information soon.

          <div class="email-content">Because it feels different, so you can tell orange apart with your 
eyes closed.  I mean, that alone could not allow you to solve the 
cube blindfolded, of course.  But in case you ever got 
accidentally &quot;lost&quot; during a solve, the location of the orange 
stickers might help you re-orient yourself.

I dunno, I&#x27;ve been thinking about this, and I usually have a Half
French Vanilla Half Hot Chocolate in the morning before I start
cubing, and it seems to give me better times...I think in competition
though, red bull would be my solution...but I dunno if I&#x27;d need
anything to get me excited :p

My name is Craig Bouchard, and I&#x27;m a cubaholic...

I also got a 13.02 non-lucky yesterday, and did over 700 solves
between Sunday, Monday and Tuesday...and I am going to Bob&#x27;s Tournament...

          <div class="email-content">At weekends I prefer drinking &quot;cube&quot;.
I have to admit it adds abit of &quot;randomness&quot; to your cubing times.
Probably because of the alcohol ;)

Have a quick look at http://www.carlsberg.se/wbch3.exe?p=1001344
(all info in swedish though)

Have a nice cubing weekend.

          <div class="email-content">Well if your old one has flat centers, the new one (with arched 
centers) will feel different, and may take some getting used to.  
But it should pop a lot less.  &quot;Good&quot; is a subjective term.  In my 
experience, the new DIY kits are good right away (once tuned and 
lubed).  No significant break-in should be required.

experience, the new DIY kits are good right away (once tuned and 
lubed).  No significant break-in should be required.

Perhaps...
But finishing 1st and 2nd in a world championship requires nerves,
don&#x27;t you think?

Jean had a lot of pressure put on him. Journalists, interviews, TV
cameras. Everybody was looking at him as the world champion who can
beat records.
Between the 2 rounds, his average improved a lot. 1.78s. Thibaut
improved much more.

A third round could have made a sub-15 average possible. I don&#x27;t know.
During the Swedish competition, you had 3 rounds. With about thrice
the number of competitors, we only had 2.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hey :-)

With all the agitated interest and demand for the olympicube(s) to 
become available (!!) it&#x27;s no wonder that it is &quot;dangerous&quot; to set a 
day for the release. I&#x27;m still confident at least the 6x6x6 will 
finally be made widely available. Too much work has gone into it to 
stop it now. And surely, if money is the issue there will be a 
solution somehow :-)

Cheers!

so at the French champs, I finished a 4x4 solve with a pop during the <br>
last couple of moves but decided to keep going with a finger in place of <br>
the missing edge piece that I kinda put back in place but not completely <br>
before stopping the timer, then stopped the timer. I thought it would be <br>
no problem since I *did* solve the cube, only an edge piece was kinda <br>
not completely &quot;inside&quot; the cube. I talked to the judges, and after not <br>
finding anything in the rules about it, we decided to give me a 2 <br>
seconds penalty. I didn&#x27;t really care, because I wasn&#x27;t in the race for <br>
victory, so I accepted the penalty and everyone was happy. But in case <br>
this happens again, what shall we do (yeah I know, put the edge <br>

There&#x27;s something in the rules, read 10d).
Rule 5b5) applies to non functional parts of the puzzle only, not edge
pieces.
*** The defect should have been fully fixed ***

But since it was a slight defect (edge piece not perfectly put back in
its slot), and otherwise the cube was unambiguously solved, we decided
to accept it with a +2 penalty.

Now I regret, it should have been declared DNF, but at this moment, it
looked a bit cruel.
And with a DNF, I would have taken your place ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hehe, same thing at my music school, I notice that every week at my 
violin lesson ;) sadly it worked too well over the winter, to the 
point of me becoming overheated and slightly dizzy.  Is that a sign 
that the Fridrich method is too powerful?  I doubt it.

By the way, how did the 7:40 AM BLD round go?  Were there way more 
DNF&#x27;s due to the timing?  Or did people get over that?  Personally I 
detest solving in any form before 10 AM; however, the only time I 
succeeded in solving 2 cubes BLD was at about 7:50 AM.  BLD&#x27;ers at 
Draughons, what do you think?

Wish I coulda gone *grumble* but due to the two upcoming, more 
convenient contests in the northeast (Rutgers, Trumbull) I had to let 
this one go.

  When using a 3LLL, does a 1/2 OLL skip count as lucky? They occur fairly regularly.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Unfortunately, yes (oh, how I hate good lucky solves...)
Your LL has 3 steps.  The solve you&#x27;re describing had 2.  Since the 
probability of skipping edge orientation is 1/8, skipping it would 
be lucky (P&lt;0.20).

          <div class="email-content">So your last F2L -> LL method is this:
(1) Insert CE pair while orienting LL edges
(2) Orient LL corners
(3) Permute LL

Your situation describes skipping step 2.  That probability (I 
believe) is 1/27.  I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s still lucky.

          <div class="email-content">Howdy!

I actually spend most of my days on a forum! It happens to be a
photography forum that has about 1400+ users active at any given time
of the day. There are hundreds of posts made every minute and the
forum is a great way to divide those posts and make it a manageable
community.

The only reason why I prefer this email group to a speedcubing forum
is because the speedcubing community is relatively small. We have very
few people that post, and those that do, don&#x27;t post 100 messages a
day. I enjoy reading every single post that people make to the group
and it&#x27;s not hard to manage because there is so few posts!

If I was to go to a speedcubing forum, then there would be the same
relatively low post count, but it would be divided among many
different &#x27;subject&#x27; forums and I would have to search through every
forum on a daily basis and try to find all the new posts that were
made. I realize I can subscribe to particular threads and get an email
notification when it is modified, however, I would rather subscribe to
ALL threads in ALL forums and receive an email notification instantly
when ANY posts are made. The yahoo group allows all this.

I like forums, I just think it would be much more difficult to read
and contribute to all the active conversations. I don&#x27;t talk that
much, but I certainly read everything :)

  The only reason why I prefer this email group to a speedcubing forum<br>
  is because the speedcubing community is relatively small. We have very<br>
  few people that post, and those that do, don&#x27;t post 100 messages a<br>

  I remember, my geography  miss was telling us in the class, that is when altitude changes, the performance of the athletes vary to a great extent. Is it same with the cubers also? The performance of the same cuber vary widely in America and Europe. What is the altitude of Orlando, Paris  and Germany (Sorry, the name of the venue is not sticking in my mind)? <br>
   <br>
  How altitude affects performance ? How much does it affect ? Is it due to change in gravitational force ? I am curious.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think it depends on the person. Personally, I prefer less oxygen
when i solve. This keeps me on my feet so that I&#x27;m completely focused
on the next edge/corner pair. I also like it when my cube is lighter.
I feel I have my control over it.

I guess to each his own :) I subscribe to 15+ other mailing lists and
I guess I like having everything accessible from one clean, (nearly)
ad-free interface.

I browse a lot of forums, and the fact that, over the years, they&#x27;ve
started show up more and more frequently in my Google searches, is not
making my that happy. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint it, but I find the
majority of forums (probably phpBB installations) clunky, slow and not
so user friendly. Maybe it&#x27;s the content of the forums that I bump
into that I don&#x27;t like :)

I have to agree with Chris and Rune here. The volume of this list does
not warrant a fine grained classification of the messages. If a
particularly interesting, high volume thread comes up, as it is now I
would just &#x27;star&#x27; it in the Gmail interface, which will notify me of
any new replies to it. This is specific to the Gmail e-mail client,
but think about it; having the messages as e-mail allows people to use
whatever interface they prefer, be it a threaded e-mail client, a
mailing list archive interface or the yahoo interface, and it allows
users to filter the messages any way they want.

Maybe there&#x27;s some nifty forum software out there that already does
this, running a forum/mailing list in tandem. Don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel
;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I never liked silly or overly strict rules. A single missing cubie 
and the cube is still unambiguously solved :-) So why at all a +2 
sec penalty? Or even a DNF?? To me it doesn&#x27;t make sense. If some 
wanna believe that all puzzle defects are caused by the puzzler, 
then so be it ... Well, this topic has been discussed far too many 
times already. R.I.P.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,

Thanks for the pictures.. They are very nice... I barely took any 
pictures of the events on saturday, because I was so busy competing 
or preparing for events.

It was great to meet everybody.. I saw a lot of new faces in this 
competition. The sport is definately growing :).

It was also great winning the 3x3 competition. It&#x27;s great to beat 
some of the fastest cubers in competition. During the races we had 
before the competition, I was very close to Lars, Ron (allthough I 
only raced him on friday, he was very fast!), Michel, Gunnar and 
Dan... So the competition was pretty exciting.

I had a nice time, and I have some new ideas to work on my 3x3 
speedsolving... I also took some pictures, and I will publish the 
good ones on my site soon... But right now I am really tired :).

Cheers ears!! (whatever that means)

Joël.

Some scientifically minded cuber with time on their hands could  <br>

  My only complaint is that while I was touring the Foothill Dorms, I saw three guys walk by, each with a cube in their hand. However, I was unable to grab intercept them to ask some questions. I hindsight, I wish I had asked them about the cubing scene at Berkeley. If I remember correctely, there were three or four guys from Berkeley at the Caltech Spring competition (if you guys are out there, send me an email). Anyone who knows if Berkeley has a cube club, or if there is some sort of unofficial group, please let me know. Or if you&#x27;re at Berkeley, or are going there next year, let me know!<br>

  PS: I&#x27;m looking to reassemble a 2x2x2 with what I believe is the Eastsheen mechanism on the inside. I can get all the way to the last corner and psuedo-edge piece, which I can&#x27;t seem to get back in together. I can reassemble the whole cube with one psuedo-edge piece out, but how do I get that last one in?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, the line has to be drawn somewhere. Maybe you finish a solve
with a missing edge piece and a missing corner piece. Since an edge
can only go in the edge hole and the corner in the corner hole, would
the cube still be unambiguously solved? Though they may seem overly
strict, the intent of the rules is to avoid gray areas like this.

          <div class="email-content">I also don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so difficult about making sure the cube is  
solved.

It&#x27;s like you go along running the 1500, and you&#x27;re completely  
dominating everyone, and then with 10 meters to go, you trip and fall.   
Even if someone else trips you, it&#x27;s not &quot;it wasn&#x27;t my fault, so I  
should have fun&quot; deal.

That man, Hicham el Guerrouj, lost the 1996 Olympic gold medal as a  
result of something like that.

What about Steven Bradburry?  Didn&#x27;t he win the 1000 meters short track  
speed skating in 2002?  Why?  Didn&#x27;t some Chinese skater fall, and trip  
over a Korean, who then knocked down Apolo Anton Ohno?  And this was  
with maybe 30 meters to go.  Apolo Anton Ohno then scrambles, and  
finishes second.

These athletes don&#x27;t ask for pity when something happens to them.  They  
wouldn&#x27;t ask for pity especially if their equipment failed.

First four moves are maybe hard to do fast at first, but it&#x27;s easy after
some practice.
(R&#x27; U&#x27; R2) here I would do the U&#x27; with right thumb, but left index finger is
ok too.

I like this alg... I&#x27;ll use it for bld-solving in the future.

Yes, I have tried forums.  I prefer mailing lists to forums, mostly because
forums don&#x27;t keep track of which individual messages I have read.

With mailing lists, I usually scan through the list subject lines every day
or so and read posts that I think are the most interesting.  I don&#x27;t usually
have time to read every message every day, especially if I miss a few days.
Later on, I can go back and read the messages that missed.

With a forum, this style of reading wouldn&#x27;t be possible.  As soon as I log
off without reading all the messages, I&#x27;d lose the indicators of what
messages I haven&#x27;t read yet.

I&#x27;m hosting the videos, and when I told Ron about it, he then got back to me with the same kind of comments. I have absolutely no idea. It works fine on my computer. I actually got it in .wmv format, but windows media player kept telling me something about the ending not being right, ut it would  still be able to read it. I then sent the files to Gilles who got the same issue, renamed it .avi, and it was fine. I did the same thing, works fine here and on a few other computers around, but some people keep having this problem. I don&#x27;t know what to do, if anyone knows, let me know and I&#x27;ll reupload a readable file.
Ron told me, it works fine with nero, and Iwould suggest trying with vlc, just in case, but I don&#x27;t know if that works too.
Sorry about it!

I get my doses of tea every day. Sometimes as much as 5 or 6 cups. 
>From what im told black tea has more coffeine than coffee. Im not 
sure about that though. At least i use only sweetener normally, and 
lemon juice. No sugar. I try to use many kinds of tea for the 
variation. I don&#x27;t like coffee :D Far too bitter for me. Love its 
smell though. I know many feel the same way ...

My point is that, either we have a traditional format where some<br>
people do not proceed to the next round, or otherwise we can feel free<br>
tto have as many rounds as we want in each competition, and let<br>
everybody do as many solves as they want. That way we will soon have<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well the same thing happened at the Chattahoochee Spring competition 
last month.  I suppose there ought to be a regulation if that&#x27;s an 
issue.  I figured it just came down to a time issue.  If there are 
dozens of competitors, obviously you wouldn&#x27;t have time to advance 
everyone.  But since both of these competitions were fairly small, 
it was feasible to allow everyone to advance.

guidelines added to the WCA rules regarding it.

Because of the small number of competitors I decided to advance 
everyone.  If I thought this action would compromise the integrity 
of the organization I wouldn&#x27;t have done it.  

In retrospect, I should have only done two rounds.  Sorry.

At the chattahooche (sp?) competition all competitors advanced to 
the final round.  Yes there were only two rounds at THAT tournament, 
but the point is that everyone in that tournament advanced to the 
final, and everyone at my tournament advanced to the final.  These 
questions could have been raised over a month ago.

          <div class="email-content">What&#x27;s the problem with &quot;wierd&quot; events?  If someone works very hard at
home on a particular puzzle that isn&#x27;t one of the main puzzles, why
can&#x27;t they go and set a WR with it?  After it&#x27;s been set, maybe it
will encourage others to work on that puzzle too, and someday it may
become a main event at competitions.

I would love it if someone worked hard on the Rainbow cube and asked
to solve it in a competition to try and beat my record.  Not only
would it encourage me to work harder, but I could then talk to that
person about the puzzle instead of always having to talk about the
3x3x3.  I&#x27;m sure record holders in other events feel the same way.

Don&#x27;t put down other puzzles or events just because you don&#x27;t like
them.  Keep working on your main puzzles if you want, and I&#x27;ll work on
whatever I choose, and let&#x27;s all have some fun.

          <div class="email-content">I agree, but if the wierdest thing is the 3-in-a-row, I think we&#x27;re
still doing well.  That and the 2x2OH aren&#x27;t too farfetched.  I do
think the next WC should have an official &quot;Drunk Cubing&quot; event on
Friday night, just for hilarity.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm... thinking... what exactly was the point of having a third round 
at RWC 2005? I do understand the first/second round separation, saved 
the time for two solves of many slow cubers. But after the second 
round the top people already had an average and the fastest could&#x27;ve 
been declared winner. Why wasn&#x27;t he? And just in case the reason was 
to give people more opportunities to do a fast average, why didn&#x27;t the 
faster one count?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,
I am really against rounds where all competitiors proceeded to the
next round. Because in a competition the most important factor is
competition pressure. And in these rounds this kind of pressure are
missing.

But I think I have a good alternative. For example if you have 8
competitiors and you want do 3 rounds you can use this system:
The 4 fastest competiors in the first round will proceede to group A
in the second round and the 4 slowest competiors to group B. Then the
second round: the 2 fastest competiors in group A will compete for the
first and second places in the third round and the two slowest
competiors in group A compete for the places 3 and 4. Further the 2
fastest competiors in group B will compete for the places 5 and 6 in
the third round and the two slowest competiors in group B compete for
the places 7 and 8.
With this system every competitior will compete in three rounds and
there is still competition pressure.

What do you think about this?

I hindsight, I wish I had asked them about the cubing scene at 
Berkeley. If I remember correctely, there were three or four guys 
from Berkeley at the Caltech Spring competition (if you guys are out 
there, send me an email). Anyone who knows if Berkeley has a cube 
club, or if there is some sort of unofficial group, please let me 
know. Or if you&#x27;re at Berkeley, or are going there next year, let me 
know!

I agree that qualification rounds where every one is sure to qualify
to the next round is a bit strange. If there is time to let everyone
make two averages I think a better way is to let the top cubers
qualify for the final and let the slower ones go to a B final. Mabye
with the two fastest from the b final geting a place in the a final.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!!

My method is like this:

Step 1: Orientate one side. Any color. Intuitive.
Step 2: Orientate the opposite side. 7 algs.
Step 3: Permutate everything. 5 algs.

That&#x27;s the basic. What I try to do during inspection is to see what
the second step will be and if I can execute Step 1+2 as one move. I
also look for cancelling moves, meaning that I see that some, or all,
of the turn I have to do in first step is the start of step 2
backwards. That way I can sometimes do step 1+2 in 5-7 moves.

Now I&#x27;m planning to learn how to do step 2+3 in one move. A lot of
algs to learn :-/

8x6x3 cases (minus symmetries), right?
This method is for the courageous, but it looks like the fastest
possible 2^3 strategy to me.

small but we had a good showing of some serious cubers, and it was a <br>
ton of fun.  I did my best ever in a competition with a sub-30 average <br>
in the finals.  Thanks to Richard Patterson and Chris Hardwick for <br>
their work in organizing and running this one.<br>
<br>
I took 5 hours of video, which will take some time to go through and <br>
edit.  Here&#x27;s a neat clip to start with, though.  It&#x27;s Frank Morris <br>
doing a 5x5x5, 4x4x4, 3x3x3, 2x2x2 relay.  It was not an official <br>
event but still pretty wicked to witness:<br>
<br>
http://tinyurl.com/nvtm9<br>

It was 3:53.12, only 25 seconds shy of his unofficial record.<br>

Permute all at once, 5 (?) algorithms.<br>

Very nice. :P<br>

Josef Jelinek has those algorithms there.<br>

@Gunnar: Why does your PLL have five algorithms? I only see the need <br>
for two: Cycle 3, Swap two pairs.<br>

I already gave the link to the method on Josef&#x27;s site and Gunnar do
not use &quot;PLL&quot;.

only solve two opposite SIDES, not LAYERS. It&#x27;s faster and also gives
shorter algorithms in step 3.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Gilles, this method seems much faster than the one layer+ oll + pll method, wich I use. To be fast every time you should know coll, otherwise fast times are the result of a bit of luck.

I&#x27;ll start learning the algoritmes now.

 8x6x3 cases (minus symmetries), right?
 This method is for the courageous, but it looks like the fastest
 possible 2^3 strategy to me.

This is the original way I learned to do the cube (&quot;JEff solves the
cube in 45 seconds&quot;)

In one look, you need to know how to orient 4 corners and to know how
many correct edges you have ahead of time (and where they are).
You can do step 1 in less than 5 moves on avg
You can do step 2 in 6 moves on avg
You can then do step 3 in less than 7 moves on avg

I think that this is a good method, but I think that FL + CLL has
potential to be faster.  Marc Waterman used to avg 16 sec with FL +
CLL (he used around 500 algs for the edges-- I only know 12 of them)  

I previously used this for CF method.  I was going to start learning
lots of algs, but then I saw that someone had come up with a much
faster way to make a Corners First Configuration.  And an easier, more
intuitive way of finishing it.

that very message I thought: &quot;Wait a minute!! Isn&#x27;t it &#x27;orientate&#x27;??
Yes, it is!!&quot; :-)

I checked it up in a swedish-english dictionary online, that said both
were OK. But I see now on &quot;your&quot; page, that I should use &quot;orient&quot;.

  Funny you would mention that. I use to say orient, but while writing<br>
  that very message I thought: &quot;Wait a minute!! Isn&#x27;t it &#x27;orientate&#x27;??<br>
  Yes, it is!!&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
  I checked it up in a swedish-english dictionary online, that said both<br>
  were OK. But I see now on &quot;your&quot; page, that I should use &quot;orient&quot;.<br>

What is unclear? I don&#x27;t see what you would think is a joke.

I went to this page: http://lexikon.nada.kth.se/cgi-bin/swe-eng
and searched for the swedish word for orientate, and it sure was
&quot;orientera&quot;. I was satisfied with that. Now, reading on the page
Stefan gave me, I see that: &quot;Orientate is more widely accepted in the
U.K. than in the U.S.A., but it should be avoided in any formal or
standard writing&quot;, so I guess that means I better use &quot;orient&quot;. A
moment ago, when I searched for the translation, on &quot;my&quot; page, for
&quot;orient&quot;, I got the same translation as &quot;orientate&quot;, but it also says

orient (more commonly  orientate)

Orientate is the usual form in British English.  Even if it really is a 
back formation, it is debatable whether that is a bad thing: if we 
didn&#x27;t allow it, we wouldn&#x27;t even be able to use the noun &quot;pea&quot;, for 
example!

 This is the original way I learned to do the cube (&quot;JEff solves the
 cube in 45 seconds&quot;)
 
 In one look, you need to know how to orient 4 corners and to know how
 many correct edges you have ahead of time (and where they are).
 You can do step 1 in less than 5 moves on avg
 You can do step 2 in 6 moves on avg
 You can then do step 3 in less than 7 moves on avg
 
 I think that this is a good method, but I think that FL + CLL has
 potential to be faster.  Marc Waterman used to avg 16 sec with FL +
 CLL (he used around 500 algs for the edges-- I only know 12 of them)  
 
 I previously used this for CF method.  I was going to start learning
 lots of algs, but then I saw that someone had come up with a much
 faster way to make a Corners First Configuration.  And an easier, more
 intuitive way of finishing it.

OK, I see your point, Rune!!
The fact that I instantly accepted Stefan&#x27;s suggestion, is that I know
I&#x27;m not an expert on english, so I just assumed that he knew better,
otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t have corrected me.

Let&#x27;s drop this topic now.

You guys took that quite seriously :-). I&#x27;m no expert, either. It just 
somehow always sounded wrong to me and the link I showed was the first 
result of a Google search for &quot;orientate&quot;. And Google finds 30 times 
as many pages with &quot;orient&quot;, though that might have another reason. 
But also 24 times as many with &quot;permute&quot; as with &quot;permutate&quot;...

Cheers!
Stefan

Rune: Tonnes? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m awful at grammar and spelling :)

To note: orientate is in the oxford english dictionary. (you can even
check it online) as is permutate. 

http://tinyurl.com/fpmwk
http://tinyurl.com/zp5nb

As you can see from the links, it appears either case can be used in
any situation. The oxford english dictionary is about as official as
it gets for the english language.

Craig: now you can shut up, I was right ;). And you can&#x27;t even spell
colour... :P

          <div class="email-content">I just got a 5x5 cube 2 days ago and I solved it a couple of times (I 
had a pretty hard time figuring it out) then checked that site to see 
if there was a faster way of doing it but there wasn&#x27;t many 
algorithms.  But now you are adding more.

Thanks for updating.

  Well I like to start it off tight to wear it in, then loosen it to my <br>
  preference.  It&#x27;s an art, not a science :)<br>

  I have now worn in two of four new DIY cubes but no dust can be seen in the cubes. The plastic here must be of an other type than in the old ones. Do you have the same impression?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, definitely.  They even make a different sound.  I think the 
plastic must be a stronger type since they made the walls of the 
pieces a bit thinner.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I had never seen one of these before the German Open and I could solve
in about 20-30 minutes.

Here is how I proceed :
1. Solve the south pole (= 1st layer)
2. Fix the midle layer centers (make sure you won&#x27;t have a tricky
parity, you can fix it by looking for a center which has some blue on
it, it&#x27;s Africa.)
3. Solve the middle layer edges

And here is the last layer, one of the most difficult part :
4. Oriente edges
5. Permute edges
6. Permute corners
7. Oriente corners

But you will be easily lose track of where you are in the algorithm as
you perform it. Therefore I suggest you to have a 3x3 next to you and
to perform algorithms one move after the other on the cube world and
the 3x3 at the same time so that you don&#x27;t get lost.

8. Solve the centers (orientation - not all of them need to be fixed :
some are completely black but some of them are not :p)

Good luck !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">As of only a couple days ago, I was imagining up a method that <br>
requires 338 algorithms and is potentially just as fast as ZB and has <br>
easier case recognition. Unfortunately, my mind can&#x27;t store so many <br>
algorithms, so I reduced the work into six steps instead of five. It <br>
combines Petrus (2x2x3), Duncan Dicks (place m-edges doing something <br>
to the LL), and Razoux-Schultz (ELL). Here goes:<br>
<br>
Intuitive let&#x27;s say in 3tps, algorithms 3.5tps.<br>
<br>
Step 1: 2x2x2<br>
5.5 moves, 1.8sec<br>
<br>
Step 2: 2x2x3<br>
6.5 moves, 2.2sec<br>
<br>
Step 3: Finish First Layer<br>
8-9 moves, 2.7-3sec &lt;--- needs work<br>
<br>
Step 4: Insert Middle Edge, Orienting Corners<br>
8.5 moves, 2.4sec, 27 algorithms<br>
<br>
Step 5: Insert Middle Edge, Permuting Corners<br>
10.5 moves, 3sec, 7 algorithms (not 8 :D, since FUFUFU&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; is in <br>
both Step 4 and 5)<br>
<br>
Step 6: Edges of Last Layer<br>
11.2 moves, 3.2sec, 19 algorithms<br>
<br>
52-53 moves 15.9-16.2sec, 53 algorithms<br>
<br>
Reasons for making this:<br>
-I like the ideas on L2L4, but can&#x27;t do step 4 permuting edges<br>
-I like intuition, just not the Fridrich style<br>
-My Fridrich F2L is horrible<br>
-My Fridrich LL is horrible<br>
-My first layer on L2L4 is horrible<br>
-My steps 4-7 on Petrus is horrible<br>
-My case recognition on CLL is horrible<br>
<br>
Any ways to make it faster?<br>

Update with algorithms:

Step 4 notation:

0: no twist
1: - twist
2: + twist
Cx: make a clockwise turn on the x-face.

012 is...:

x 1

2 0

222 U B&#x27; U&#x27; B L2 D F D&#x27; L2

These haven&#x27;t been optimized for finger tricks yet.

Step 5 notation:

2 is the URB corner
3 is the ULF corner
4 is the URF corner

234 looks like:

x 2

3 4

234: F U F U F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; (Step 4&#x27;s 000)
243: U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F

423: U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R
(Eh, longer than 10.5 moves, and actually 5 algorithms)


Step 6 is on Bernard Helmstetter&#x27;s lists.

          <div class="email-content">I know around 60, that is use all the time.  And that is barely a
touch on the ones I need to know.  I have a few left on the f2l I need
to know, I only have maybe 5-6 of the OLL (out of 57 I need to know),
and I have like 5-7 PLL algs out of 13 or so.  I also learned a few
simple algs for the 4x4 and 5x5.  Right now I average 35-40 seconds.
My PLL is by far the slowest time, as my f2l is around 20-25 seconds
and that includes a 4-7 second cross on average :(.

As for myself, I use the WCA regulations on scrambles:
&quot;4d) Cubes are generally scrambled with the white (or the lightest
colour) face on top and green (or blue or the darkest face) on the front.&quot;

I didn&#x27;t get back until quite late last night, so I didn&#x27;t get the
chance to jump on here.  I too would like to thank Bob for a fun
tournament (not including the slight problems :p)  Cory and Anthony
Cleaned up, and I was kicking at their heels in every event almost :p
Oh, and I know what I did wrong on all 3 BLD attempts...Stefan, we
need to talk...

Anyways, I got 7 national records about what I was hoping for:
4x4x4 - 1:20.94
4x4x4 Average - 1:43.71
5x5x5 - 3:20.31
5x5x5 Average - 3:33.62
Master Magic - 3.09
Master Magic Average - 4.32
Magic - 1.18 (second fastest ever in competition)

Theres a good whackload of video out there someone took, but I dunno
if and when it will surface.  I screwed up magic cuz I did a 1.12 the
attempt before my official attempts, and everyone saw
it...humph...anyways...

I got some times I was really happy with too...I think I&#x27;m the only
person that can say they were in every single round of the competition
:p It was a busy day, but I had a lot of fun...Lacey, this isn&#x27;t over...

Random orientation, throwing the cube in the air. When you make a
video, it (almost) proves you can&#x27;t cheat.
Given that all competitors do not have the same color scheme,
scrambles can&#x27;t be identical. (yeah, that&#x27;s a problem)

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, throwing the cube in the air is undoubtedly good when making a 
video, but I think it&#x27;s a good thing to follow WCA regulations, I 
mean, just like in a real contest, where every cube is scrambled by 
the same person (or with the same techniques) for every competitor. 
Up to now I applied a given scramble randomly, because I didn&#x27;t know, 
but from now on I think I&#x27;ll follow this simple rule ;)

counted...heck, maybe even WR&#x27;s for magic single + average.  I know 
why you didn&#x27;t do so well: my dad wasn&#x27;t judging you ;)

Oh, don&#x27;t blame Stefan for his BLD method.  It worked fine for me ;)

I did horribly on 4x4 in my first two solves.  First one was a pop 
that killed my concentration, not to mention that I put the corner 
in wrong, then when I fixed it I did that wrong.  Second was 
ridiculous: I did centers in the wrong order and it took me forever 
to notice that red was next to orange.

My 3x3 DNF in round 2 was a 2-piece pop as I set the cube down.  It 
was 24.xx so I&#x27;d have dropped it anyway.

Nice job everyone, especially cory on almost getting a 12.40 
average ;)  Too bad it was actually 19.xx.  By the way, what on 
earth do you plan on doing with your 54 cubesmith logo stickers??

Thanks very much, Bob, that was a great contest.
Can&#x27;t wait for May 27!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had a few people ask me similar questions so I&#x27;m making a FAQ :p

Q: What Happened on the 98.35?
A: I was doing a good solve, about to be 20.xx, doing the A perm when
3-4 pieces flew outta my cube, so I found them on the ground, shoved
them back in (didn&#x27;t know how, so I just stuck them in randomly) and
so I had to redo almost the whole solve, so by now it is about 35-40
and I&#x27;m restarting the solve, and I get to OLL and see that an edge is
flipped, so I orient my edges, then I go to orient my corners, and
they are wrongly put it, so I have to fix those, then I go to PLL, and
theres a 3 edge cycle with a 2 corner cycle, so I have to pull out
some pieces, put them back in, and do the F perm...and then bam I&#x27;m
done :)

Q: Why did all your BLD solves DNF?
A: I am slowly moving over into a more advanced version that Pochmann
and I are making, and I use 1 alg so far, cuz its quite good...it is:
x&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U l&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, I was doing it as: x&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U l&#x27;
F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, so it didn&#x27;t work...you can figure out why the one
didn&#x27;t work :) and it screws everything up...and I had that in all 3
solves, weirdly enuff...

Any more questions???

It&#x27;s cute that we do this, and it&#x27;s for some reason really important  <br>

I like the idea of giving every competitor the same cubes, the very
same color configurations. But it&#x27;s impossible with different color
schemes.

I share your opinion. Averages only make results fair, we all know this.

          <div class="email-content">In blindfolding, it starts to matter a lot more, and I think this 
applies to all methods out there.  The reason is because the 
permutation length is color neutral.  So, someone who gets an 8-cycle + 
12-cycle will definitely have a harder time than someone getting a 5 + 
2 and a 6.

We can&#x27;t really have different standards for solving the cube that are 
dependent on method, so if it matters a little, it should be there.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, now that I think about it, I think it completely matters in 
blindfolding.

In speed solving, unless you&#x27;re grotesquely obvious, there probably 
isn&#x27;t an advantage you can give me so that I could beat Macky.  (Even 
if I started with a cross every time... though I feel that would be 
grotesquely obvious.)

I&#x27;m pretty sure if we took 6 random scrambles, and I get to pick three 
based on the &quot;parameters of the solve&quot; (in other words, they tell me 
the size of the cycles), and Leyan has to solve the other three, I 
would win in a blindfold competition.  On the other hand, if he gets to 
choose, he would win.

Until just recently I was using my mom&#x27;s cube from the early &#x27;80s, but
had to get a new one because it kept poopping like 2+ times per solve.

What? It was a shock when I looked at the photograph!!!
&quot;Passage de la Bonne Graine&quot;, that&#x27;s where I live!!!

The proof? I just went in the street with my camera, the cubes are
only 100m away from my flat :-)

They choosed mine, one of the smallest.

          <div class="email-content">As Craig had mentioned, someone took a &quot;whackload&quot; of video at
Rutgers. That was me. I&#x27;ve extracted some highlights and
converted them to MPEG1 (1.4 megabits/sec). I also downloaded
the DIVX converter. It produced somewhat smaller files, or to get
much smaller file size than MPEG, I had had to use the quality
setting aimed at handheld devices.

Still, the files are too big to upload to the files section, so
I am asking for suggestions on what to do with videos. The
following list is around 55 megabytes total (MPEG1) or 
around 13 megabytes for low-quality DIVX.

1. Craig&#x27;s Canadian record 4x4x4 solve (pre-inspection + last 35+
seconds).
2. Cory&#x27;s 1:29.85 4x4x4 solve.
3. Lacey&#x27;s final Master Magic attempt.
4. Anthony&#x27;s sub-15 second solve.
5. Anthony&#x27;s winning BLD solve

I have lots of other video as well. Let me know what you want to see.

I wish to add my thanks to Bob Burton and all who helped out to
make the event happen. I also want to thank those who used my
camera to take videos of me.

Ah, thanks. I had wondered what those were. :D

By the way, do you know what happened to that group of figures in 
bronze in St Peter&#x27;s Square?  Their gender-deprived condition perhaps 
symbolized the hideous after-effects of nuclear war:

http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3704

Not a very good picture.  The official title of the piece was something 
clunky like &quot;Nuclear Family&quot;, so it was fun now and then to think up 
better names for the sculpture.

<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve had a few people ask me similar questions so I&#x27;m making a FAQ :p<br>
<br>
  Q: What Happened on the 98.35?<br>
  A: I was doing a good solve, about to be 20.xx, doing the A perm when<br>
  3-4 pieces flew outta my cube, so I found them on the ground, shoved<br>
  them back in (didn&#x27;t know how, so I just stuck them in randomly) and<br>
  so I had to redo almost the whole solve, so by now it is about 35-40<br>
  and I&#x27;m restarting the solve, and I get to OLL and see that an edge is<br>
  flipped, so I orient my edges, then I go to orient my corners, and<br>
  they are wrongly put it, so I have to fix those, then I go to PLL, and<br>
  theres a 3 edge cycle with a 2 corner cycle, so I have to pull out<br>
  some pieces, put them back in, and do the F perm...and then bam I&#x27;m<br>
  done :)<br>
<br>
  Should this solve really be approved? Speaking highly theoretically, if four pieces &quot;flew outta your cube&quot;, you can rearrange them to get a better situation than you had earlier. What does the law say in this case?<br>

It says:

&quot;5b2)	During the repairing of the puzzle, the competitor may not 
intentionally make the position easier to solve than before the 
defect.&quot;

Dang... for a moment I thought there&#x27;s a way for me to get the 
Square-1 world record...

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ll be perfectly honest about this, I&#x27;ve always just straightened the
faces on my cube when that happens.

According to the rules I should have been disqualified immediately for
doing this (something I didn&#x27;t know until just now).

&quot;During this inspection time, the competitor is allowed to pick up the
puzzle, but he may not manipulate the puzzle in anyway. If the
competitor manipulates the puzzle, the solve is disqualified.&quot;

Is the best solution to finish the inspection time.  Then say that I
would like the faces to be realigned?  Also, am I disqualified if I
look at the cube to make sure the judge is realigning them correctly?
 (I could be looking for an Xcross, or a better cross).

I think it would be nice to allow competitors to straighten the faces,
but if it would be better to have the judge do this I&#x27;ll start doing
that in the future.  Also, maybe judges should be trained to make sure
the cube is perfectly aligned before they set it down.  And if
something happens and the cube is misaligned the competitor can
request it at the end of the 15 seconds?

          <div class="email-content">I looked at strangepuzzle.com, and that site appears to require the
videos to be available online already (temporarily, anyway). So I
looked for a free site I could put them on. I also noticed that the
files on strangepuzzle.com (the few I looked at) were .wmv files. So I
downloaded some software that would convert my AVI files to that
format. So I&#x27;ve made available .wmv files of the videos I mentioned
before at the URLs listed below. If someone (particular the solver in
the video clip) wants to archive them to strangepuzzle.com, that is
fine with me. These URLs should work for at least 31 days (actually 31
days from the time someone last downloads the particular file).

I have these five files currently available. The links bring up a web
page that will allow  you to download the file.

Let me know if you want me to put up any other videos from the Rutgers
event. If I taped it I should be able to locate it and post it. (I do
not have Cory&#x27;s 2:12.93 5x5x5 solve.) I can also post files as MPEG if
you want higher quality (and larger file sizes).

solving (andrew spelman) as for i have never seen myself cube before
and would find it interesting. If you could send it to me at

I also had one occasion where this happened during the German Open... 
I am not sure which puzzle it was, but it might have been the megaminx 
(which pops very nasty, if faces are not aligned perfectly). It just 
needed a tiny little press of a finger to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen 
on the first move... And I&#x27;ll also admit that I did that... I think it 
should be allowed. Making a move of 1 milimeter is clearly different 
from making a full move, so judges should not have any trouble judging 
this.

I noticed this too, and as I picked it up I just squeezed the cube,
and you couldn&#x27;t tell I did it...I just squeezed as I picked up, and
it was fixed...

I hardly think squeezing the cube would count as &quot;manipulating&quot; the 
puzzle.  I&#x27;m sure that rule is there to prevent people from doing 
trial twists during inspection, etc.  Nevertheless it would probably 
make sense to have a regulation instructing the judge to ensure 
correct alignment prior to inspection.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bruce,

Thanks for linking to those videos, I enjoyed watching them.  If you
get a chance to put any more up let us know, I for one would love to
watch them.  As a personal request, if you happen to have any of me,
could I get some slightly uncompressed versions?  Let me know at
cparlett@....edu.

Also, thanks again to Bob for running a great tournament.  It was
great to see everyone there (either again or for the first time).  We
had a wide range of ages, regions, and cubing experience represented,
which made for a great mix.  Also, I was the only Chris there, but the
first few times they called me I wasn&#x27;t sure if they meant me or one
of the 6 other Chris&#x27;s.

          <div class="email-content">Except that judging when a cube is perfectly aligned is not a trivial  
thing. Maybe it&#x27;s not even an objective thing. I can feel when my  
cube is in perfect harmony, and I can fix it while inspecting - you  
won&#x27;t even notice, except that there&#x27;ll be a bit more squeaking than  
usual.

If it&#x27;s misaligned after that, it&#x27;s my fault. If it&#x27;s the judges  
responsibility, all sorts of problems with perceived or real  
disadvantages, random or intentional, can occur.

One of the very best things with modern cubing is that you get to  
supply your own cube. Thus you have no one to blame if it performs  
badly or not to your taste. I would just keep things simple, and  
treat this similarly. The only regulation would be that you can&#x27;t  
make actual moves (duh!), and that you have to retain the cubic shape  
- not start with the first move quarter done.

It looks well explained and nice looking.
Except &quot;Solving the edges plus 2 corners&quot;, it&#x27;s maybe the most
difficult stage, but there are not a lot of details :-)

Great new page Ryan!!!

   I looked at strangepuzzle.com, and that site appears to require the
 videos to be available online already (temporarily, anyway). So I
 looked for a free site I could put them on. I also noticed that the
 files on strangepuzzle.com (the few I looked at) were .wmv files. So I
 downloaded some software that would convert my AVI files to that
 format. So I&#x27;ve made available .wmv files of the videos I mentioned
 before at the URLs listed below. If someone (particular the solver in
 the video clip) wants to archive them to strangepuzzle.com, that is
 fine with me. These URLs should work for at least 31 days (actually 31
 days from the time someone last downloads the particular file).
 
 I have these five files currently available. The links bring up a web
 page that will allow  you to download the file.

 Let me know if you want me to put up any other videos from the Rutgers

 not have Cory&#x27;s 2:12.93 5x5x5 solve.) I can also post files as MPEG if
 you want higher quality (and larger file sizes).

It would be nice to have some acquaintance there.<br>

Scramblers doing that should be sacked! ;-) Hehe ... :D

But seriously if some layers are not aligned, it must be possible to 
sort that out before the inspection time commenses?

Cheers!

I am not sure if we do have cubers in Vancouver or not.  Sorry, I 
think the bulk of us are on the eastern side of the continent.  As 
for a place to buy cubes, Toys R Us is always good, if you are going 
for the pre-packaged cube angle.  And I know there are some in 
Vancouver (see website for details).

Of course, if he is here long enough, tell him to order some DIY 
kits from rubiks.com since it is easy and cheap to have it shipped 
within the country.

I *highly* recommend splitting that page up (into 2 or 3). If I&#x27;m 
having trouble loading the page, then I&#x27;d bet a majority of people 
have the same issue, although it might be localized to IE6.

I suspect you are using more applets than the designer orignally 
intended to be on the same page simutaneously. It maxed out my CPU and 
caused my *new* computer to crash.

I was having almost the same problem when using Internet Explorer. 
The page was extremely slow and used 100% cpu. When i reopened the 
page in Firefox 2.0 it worked fine, despite the high number of 
applets :-)

          <div class="email-content">No, it loaded just fine now. Now that I can see it, I recommend 
splitting it into roughly 6 sections since it takes about 18 pages 
to print it all. It would split nicely into 4 I can see.

A lot of very well organized and useful information all in one 
place, I like what you did.

On a related note... 
http://software.rubikscube.info/AnimCube/index.html freezes for me. 
It&#x27;s got to be my system or the stability of that applet. I wonder 
if anybody else had touble with his site. (6 minutes later, hem... 
so it does finish loading)

Yes, I have that problem, using IE6 under Windows XP, with an up-to-

Hey Sachin, I live in Vancouver BC.
If you budy is a cuber i would love to meet up with him and share
methods and tricks. Im a resomably new cuber and have been cubing for
4 months (3 speed cubing, 2 petrus, 1 fridrich) and just made a 56.xx
avg earlyer today.
As for a good place to buy cubes, Toys R Us is your best bet for 3x3
cubes but if your looking for 4x4 or 5x5 cubes the only place you can
find them is at the Sience and Nature store.
http://www.shopwillowbrook.com:8080/wma/store_detail.jsp?storeId=153
Revenge is $30.77CND after taxes and a Professor is $36CND before
tax(I think).
I myself am also looking for Vancouver area cubers so if you find any
please contact me.

Hope this is helpful,
Balrog

<br>
The problem is more subtle since only the first applet on that page is<br>
using a thread continously (the one in demo mode). All of the other<br>
applets are idle until you click on one of their animation buttons, at<br>
which time a temporary thread is created, just for as long as it takes<br>
to perform the animation of that(/those) move(s).<br>
<br>
So where are all those other threads coming from? The Java environment<br>
itself needs some threads itself to manage GUI events. Unfortunately, it<br>
appears that 100 Java environments have been created on that page to<br>
manage 100 applets, and so there are 100 times more system threads than<br>
should really be necessary. Ideally, there should be one set of system<br>
threads per application (i.e. the browser), not one set per applet.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
I have recenty been speeding up my PLL recognition by recognising a <br>
part of it during OLL recognition. It maybe doesnt work for a lot of <br>
OLLs, but with some OLLs, some stickers stay together during the <br>
execution. One of the nicest examples is:<br>
<br>
Setup: R&#x27; U&#x27;  F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R<br>
<br>
OLL alg: R&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;FRF&#x27; U R.<br>
<br>
Notice after setup moves, the UFR, UBR and UR stickers have the same <br>
color! They will all end up on the left side. If you recognise the <br>
PLL in blocks, this will often give you a good clue about where one <br>
of the &#x27;blocks&#x27; might end up. <br>
<br>
At the same time, after the setup moves, the FLU and FU stickers are <br>
the same.. They will end up on the R face.<br>
<br>
When I get this case, I can often use this to get a clue about what <br>
kind of PLL it is... (Often I can exclude that it&#x27;s an E <br>
permuation :D). And I really feel that it speeds up the PLL <br>
recognition... After the OLL, I can often adjust U exactly right <br>
without looking.<br>
<br>
Another nice example you really should see is:<br>
<br>
Setup:  r U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; r&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Here, the UF and UFR stickers are the same.. Also the UBR/UR and <br>
LU/LUF stickers. You can often see something comming here..<br>
<br>
Well.. I hope someone likes this idea.. There are many more <br>
examples.. It doesnt really take a long time to learn, because once <br>
you have seen it once or twice, you know it... <br>

it&#x27;s really great to watch you solve a master magic. 
You did it at the German cube day the first evening and I was very impressed.

A low number of cases in steps (N) and (N+1) allows you to anticipate
(N+1) at the beginning of (N) or while executing the sequence.
And with experience, you can anticipate move cancelations between (N)
and (N+1), and even sometimes choose a (N) or (N+1) sequence that make
cancelations possible, when there&#x27;s choice.

That&#x27;s why methods based on many simple steps are not that slow, and
the potential advantage of methods using a huge number of sequences is
not as big as it seems to be.

But with (OLL) and (PLL), I think there are too many cases. Long ago,
when I was doing (corners orientatation) and (PLL), I tried to
anticipate permutations too, and optimize some. With the full scope of
OLLs, I hope you have courage and patience if you want to acquire
enough knowledge to cover a significant part of them!

          <div class="email-content">Tnx for the compliment.It was a very great time at GCD.It has realy 
been fun.

I have that puzzle for so long and played many times with it.
i know 4 solutions/methods for the MM
3 i figger it out on my own the other solution is stefans method

my last method came because of the Magic Ball&#x27;s and all i did was 
trying to fit some trick of that puzzle in the MM and it works but 
backwards hehe :) its cool to see there are more solutions/method for 
solving the MM maybe there are more.

greets Alexander

The recording was done at my residence, Bernett&#x27;s school, in a public park etc in dec-2005. In addition the studio interview will be held on 27th may in bombay. Bombay is 2000 km away from my home town Trichy. <br>
  Is there any cuber in this group from Bombay other than Sachin ? Bernett would love to meet Sachin and co. Perhaps it will be the first ever meet of Indian cubers.<br>

  Hey everybody,

  I have recenty been speeding up my PLL recognition by recognising a 
  part of it during OLL recognition. It maybe doesnt work for a lot of 
  OLLs, but with some OLLs, some stickers stay together during the 
  execution. One of the nicest examples is:

To make this absolutely clear: I am not talking about recognising 
the WHOLE PLL during the OLL recognition... I don&#x27;t think that would 
save me any time... I am talking about recognizing small blocks of 
the PLL.

But, well I didn&#x27;t really train on this : I just noticed that when I
see solved blocks on the OLL and if they are at the right position
depending on the OLL, the block will be saved.

But I only know the very basic cases...

this puzzle again, you come along with another great solution I have 
to practice. Darn. Got 3.84 today after about 50 minutes. Sub3 
hopefully soon, my magic wastes a lot of time in the second half cause 
it&#x27;s not used to the new method yet and does flips I don&#x27;t want it to.

          <div class="email-content">Slice moves (actual slice moves) come in handy when part of the 
cross is already built on another face.

Say three pieces of the cross are built on the R face.  I would do z 
as my cube rotation before I start and then do M&#x27; E M to place the 
cross center inside the cross.

I&#x27;ve even had solves where the cross was entirely and correctly 
built but on the wrong face, and that trick works really well too.  
It&#x27;s a 3 move cross if you count in STM, and the moves are all 
pretty quick too.

Just my two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Any speedsolving method doesn&#x27;t assume any particular turn metric ;-)

The only applicable metric is time :D

(Fewest moves is another matter however ... ok don&#x27;t start a 
discussion on fewest moves turn metric pls! :-P )

My 2 cents !

One problem, though...I don&#x27;t own a master magic.  Does anyone know

option, but there&#x27;s none for sale there right now.  Any advice would 
be greatly appreciated.

          <div class="email-content">Hello there,

Here is the video of our appearance in the news (in French) :
http://www.belgiancubes.be/videos/BelgianOpen2006-RTBF.avi

I also wrote a report and posted some pictures over here :
http://www.belgiancubes.be/pictures/BelgianOpen2006/
(I also updated the pages for those of you who had problems with the
German Open pictures.)

It was great to see veryone and to run my first competition :-)
See you !
Gilles.

Buy two regular Rubik&#x27;s Magics from rubiks.com and use the
instructions on Jaap&#x27;s puzzle page
(http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/magic.htm) to make a Master
Magic out of their parts.  Also, I&#x27;d recommend not getting the
Simpsons or Harry Potter version of the magic puzzles, because the
plastic tiles in those puzzles are thinner than the standard version,
and a Master Magic made from these puzzles will tend to not lay as
flat when solved.  This could potentially disqualify you if you are
trying to solve by the WCA regulations.

          <div class="email-content">:) It is awesome. Thats why I&#x27;m keeping one for myself. The auction is 
still up for almost 5 more days so do bid on it if you really wan&#x27;t it. 
I can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t end the auction early to sell it directly, because that 
would be unfair towards the other bidders.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks.  Fortunately I had a few extra magics lying around.  Three 
broken strings + many frustrating hours later, I&#x27;m done.  After 
about 10 solves, my best time&#x27;s around 13.42 seconds.  It&#x27;ll be a

I think that i might have had a little problem and deleted all of 
the Sunday Contest entries that I recieved on Saturday up until 
Sunday evening.  Anyone who submitted times during that period 
should resend them if possible.

I&#x27;m sorry for all of the problems this week.  It just hasn&#x27;t been a 
great week :(

If the website is down, could you post the scrambles here for this

          <div class="email-content">congrats..  i dont think i&#x27;ve ever solved it in less than 5 minutes, although i only know 3 algorithms, and i have no real system.
   
  plus i&#x27;ve probably only solved it a dozen times total.. lol.
   
  that&#x27;s mainly b/c i didn&#x27;t take the time to actually memorize the 3 algorithms until recently, so most of the time i was unable to actually solve the cube.
   
  how long did it take you to get from around 5 minutes to 2 minutes? (i dont care beyond that, because i never plan on being one of the best cubists on the 4x4 or any cube... but it would be nice to get down to around 2 minutes)
