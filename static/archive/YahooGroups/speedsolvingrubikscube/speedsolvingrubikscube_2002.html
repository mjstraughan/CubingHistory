What the hell?  5 seconds ago I was looking at the old club, I 
refresh the page, and I come back to this crap...  I want things back 
to the way they were, and countless pieces of advice are now lost!

I think you&#x27;ll find Chris can&#x27;t do anything about the display  (or 
indeed the adverts)  This is the last of my clubs to migrate and 
for all its bad points, there are some good points.  We can start 
uploading files to the files section (videos and what not).  
Another thing you can do, if you set it up, you can reply to posts 
using your email client.  Which means you don&#x27;t have to use the 
webpage, therefore avoiding the ads.

Hey Chill Dan!

I am a member of a few clubs, they have all migrated to groups 
whether the founder wanted to or not.  This has taken some time 
to do, the first of my clubs migrated some months back.  It&#x27;s 
possible that some messages may return, as I found with some 
of my other clubs.

Chris really didn&#x27;t choose to do this.  In fact, there has been a 
banner at the top of the club for 6 months or so, warning that 
clubs and groups are merging.  It&#x27;s quite likely that Chis himself 
is in for a shock cos he probably doesn&#x27;t know yet!

If you want to moan at someone, moan at Yahoo!  But good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hi<br>
<br>
I want to learn speedng methods in rubiks cube, so I found the <br>
following link which has last layer moves<br>
<br>
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html<br>
<br>
Now the problem is even though I identify the pattern and do the <br>
correct algorithm, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.<br>
<br>
I hold the last layer on top position when doing this. I think that <br>
is the way to follow those algos. am i right ?<br>
<br>
So why it doesnt work? May be I do not understand the folloing <br>
notations.<br>
<br>
O7a) (13,13,11,4) Rs U&#x27;B&#x27;U B U B U B&#x27;U&#x27;Ls<br>
07b) (12,18,9,6)  R² U²B F&#x27;L&#x27;B²F²R&#x27;D²R²B F&#x27;<br>
<br>
can any body decypher it to me please? <br>
<br>
to my understanding move 7a means<br>
<br>
Rs = RL&#x27; = Right layer clockwise 90 degrees and Left layer counter <br>
clockwise 90 degrees ?<br>
<br>
the rest also the same right ?<br>
<br>
Any help will be appreciated.<br>

About the only thing i can tell you is to make sure your holding the 
cube in the right position, and make sure you turn the correct sides 
the correct direction,(i used to get confused on B and B&#x27;) so maybe 
its a problem similar to that.  And make sure you keep the front side 
as the front and don&#x27;t let yourself accidentially turn the cube and 
turn the wrong side.....
well i think thats about it

          <div class="email-content">Hi gang, Hi Jess,<br>
<br>
I had the same idea than Jess: build a real forum for the community,<br>
the new Yahoo! Group is really awful, slow and ad-full.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s why yesterday I installed on my site a complete forum (phpBB)<br>
<br>
Try it here:<br>
http://ulysse.iie.cnam.fr/formet/phpBB<br>
(the URL is likely to change in the future)<br>
<br>
This forum is powerful and easy to use, with a lot of features: <br>
(here are the main ones)<br>
-registered members, moderators<br>
-several categories and sub-forums<br>
-HTML code and/or BBCode in posts, smileys, images<br>
-new posts indicator<br>
-themes, languages support<br>
-user preferences<br>
-private messages<br>
-powerful search engine<br>
-answers notification by email<br>
-... and much more<br>
<br>
and everything is configurable, just ask, (the color theme may <br>
change soon)<br>
<br>
The different categories and sub-forums are not created yet (it will <br>
be done today, you can suggest a hierarchy), but you can already <br>
test it.<br>
<br>
So, what do you think about it?<br>
<br>
To better replace this yahoo group, I can also create a chatroom and <br>
a place for files and photos.<br>
<br>
I think everything is said, I&#x27;m waiting for your reactions.<br>
I hope you will like the idea.<br>

Rube, maybe you&#x27;d like to offer an opinion on this where we are 
talking about it in Benoit Formet&#x27;s new forum.

A lot of guys here seems to like Benoit Formet&#x27;s forum and have <br>

<br>
If everybody moves to this new forum, which seems to be the case <br>
gradually, a new chat is also necessary.<br>

at http://www-eleves.iie.cnam.fr/formet/chat/ and http://www-<br>
eleves.iie.cnam.fr/formet/chat.html<br>
I suggest that you try both of them, and we&#x27;ll decided which one will <br>
be used in the future.<br>
The first one&#x27;s great advantage is that messages are kept during 96 <br>
hours. So you can access them be recalling the history.<br>
The second one is similar to the actual Yahoo chat, and it can also <br>
be accessed by irc.<br>
It will soon be available from the forum with a link, but for now <br>

I&#x27;m really getting into the new forum! I&#x27;ve managed to do some 
smart stuff in there.  Just now, I even managed to insert a movie 
of me doing a pll alg in the middle of one of my messages!  So 
come on, check it!

What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?

Hello Anna,

There is another forum you could ask at:

http://www-eleves.iie.cnam.fr/formet/phpBB

At that forum, pictures can be placed in messages, it makes it 
easier to follow peoples suggestions.

I use the same method you are using and if I follow where your 
problem is, I think I understand.  It probably doesn&#x27;t matter which 
corner and edge are your working pieces.  Turn them so they are 
together, even if the slices end up being a different colour.

Will you be using one alg (an F2L alg) to get both pieces in at 
once?  Or are you following a simpler two step alg to get the 
pieces in separately?  I usually use two algs, unless the pieces 
are in a position that I happen to know the single alg for.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Anna I read that you&#x27;ve got some problems solving<br>
the cube. I must say that the method you are trying to<br>
master isn&#x27;t a very fast one. It&#x27;s a decent method but<br>
it isn&#x27;t fast. if you want to do speedcubing avoid all<br>
the layer methods, except one. The method I&#x27;m talking<br>
about is called the Lars Petrus method. <br>
<br>
Lars Petrus was the Swedish champion and he gained the<br>
fourth place at the World Championchips in 1982. He<br>
did this with his method.<br>
<br>
The Lars Petrus method isn&#x27;t very easy but with some<br>
practice I&#x27;m sure you can master it.<br>
This is the site with the method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Blade, I disagree with you.  As we have discussed on here <br>

too big/much(??).<br>

Yeah, you&#x27;ll never reach 20 seconds that way.<br>
<br>
I think you need to get down to 50-60 moves to do world class<br>
times. Or does anyone know of different numbers?<br>

An Average speedcuber uses around 40 to 55 moves.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
Maybe I am old-fashioned, but for the time being I stay with this <br>
forum.<br>
<br>
I made some cubing videos to see where I can still improve. I <br>
sometimes lose valuable time during the preparation for the <br>
permutation algorithm.<br>
<br>
These small steps are done after doing the orientation algorithm:<br>
A) move the upper layer to get to a position in which you are able to <br>
recognize which permutation situation the cube is in<br>
B) recognize which permutation algorithm to use<br>
C) move upper layer to get to starting position of the permutation <br>
algorithm<br>
D) execute the permutation algorithm<br>
E) do a correction move of the upper layer to solve the cube<br>
<br>
You can skip step A, if you are able to recognize each situation from <br>
any angle.<br>
<br>
It should be possible to do steps A and B during the end of the <br>
execution of the orientation algorithm, at least for some cases.<br>
<br>
For step C it would be good if you have alternative algorithms, <br>
depending on the angle of the upper layer. On page <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_permutation.html there is an <br>
overview of the algorithms, and f.i. for cases P6 and P7 I can <br>
execute the algorithms for the situation on the image, and for the <br>
situation where the cube is rotated 180 degrees.<br>
<br>
Step D is all about finding the fastest move sequences and short cuts <br>
for your fingers. Guys like Katsu, Pejave and Kyubeman helped me a <br>
lot to improve this step.<br>
<br>
You need to do step E statistically in 75 percent of the cases. But <br>
there are some ways to improve that percentage.<br>
<br>
Here comes my observation. I noticed that for some cases (P1, P2, P3, <br>
P4, P8, P10 [depending on the algorithm I use], P18 and P21) I first <br>
move the upper layer or bottom two layers, to get to the angle where <br>
I do not need to execute step E anymore after step D. Doing this I <br>
lose a lot of time, maybe 1 to 2 seconds, because I always do <br>
consecutive U&#x27; moves. So it sometimes takes 3 U&#x27; moves and some <br>
thinking time before I can get started.<br>
For all other cases I do not care about the angle, so I just execute <br>
the algorithm, and then do step E.<br>
<br>
The reason for this is probably that for the above cases, the used <br>
permutation algorithm does not end with a correction move of the <br>
upper layer. In other cases because they end up with an easy to do <br>
step E. For most algorithms step E is just a small move with the left <br>
or right index finger (or even a thumb). But for other algorithms, <br>
especially those where the cube is rotated during the algorithm, I <br>
lose valuable time to do the last step E move.<br>
<br>
My questions to you are: Do you recognize this behavior? How do you <br>
handle these situations? Do you have any hints on how to improve?<br>
<br>
Please join the chatroom during the weekends. It is fun, and you can <br>
learn a lot from other fast/desperate/hooked/novice/Jim Courier look-<br>
alike/MASTER guys.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

http://ulysse.iie.cnam.fr/formet/contest/index.php?page=0331.htm <br>
<br>
There was only 6 participants last week, which can be explained by <br>
the fact that it was the weekend of Easter. <br>
I hope you will be more numerous this week at Jesses&#x27; and the <br>
following ones. <br>
<br>
Henceforth the Sunday contest news will be mainly posted on the new <br>
forum:<br>
<br>
http://ulysse.iie.cnam.fr/formet/phpBB<br>
<br>
Moreover I made little improvements to this forum. Amongst other <br>
things I added several color themes (look at your preferences).<br>
I also added to the site a page where you can share files or photos <br>
and one other page of bookmarks (still empty for the moment, I&#x27;m <br>
waiting for your submission (a form will follow)), in addition to <br>
the chatroom.<br>
And I added a Navigation bar on the homepage of the forum, to gather <br>
all these pages at a same place.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I have also just joined (a few weeks ago). My best time is 38 secs, 
but that was a while ago. I haven&#x27;t done much cubing in the last few 
years and my times at the moment are around 1 min (+/- 10 secs).

I&#x27;ve been reading some of the cube websites by these guys and I was 
blown away! You should have a look at their sites too and you&#x27;ll see 
that anything slower than about 30 secs seems barely worth 
mentioning! It&#x27;s amazing!

I sent one in about two weeks ago, maybe a little more, and it is 
already posted. Maybe you should try sending it again.

          <div class="email-content">My favourite old racing cube has been looking a bit worse for wear <br>
for a while. The edges of most stickers have chipped bits and 2 of <br>
the stickers keep falling off -- not from ever having pealed them <br>
off, of course, because we all know this would be sacrilege, but just <br>
from years and years of racing. (If only I had a dollar for everytime <br>
someone has seen me solve the cube and said &quot;I had a cube when I was <br>
younger. I used to peal the stickers off.&quot; People who desecrate cubes <br>
like this don&#x27;t deserve to have them!!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I digress... I bought a new cube, but it&#x27;s just not the same. <br>
The old cube is like an old pair of jeans which may be faded and have <br>
holes, but are just so comfortable and you feel so at home with. The <br>
new cube is all pristine and lacks the same character, but what is <br>
worse is that it&#x27;s sooo stiff. I reckon I&#x27;d have trouble getting <br>
under 1.5 minutes, let alone down to 50 seconds (which is a decent <br>
time for me with my old cube).<br>
<br>
I saw a variety of cubes in the shops but I bought a Rubik&#x27;s brand <br>
one (not a cheap clone) which was more expensive but I was after <br>
quality. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it with time, but for now it&#x27;s <br>
just sitting on my shelf... :/<br>

          <em>Date:</em> Sun, 14 Apr 2002 22:55:30 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">GosD: Your apology is accepted.  You have irritated the hell out of <br>
me more than once with your bluntness, rudeness, and mis-stated <br>
facts.  However, you have my respect because of your accomplishments <br>
and for the help you have given me in the past, and for the <br>
sincerity of your note.  Anyone can have a bad day.  <br>
<br>
In your last post you asked for facts; here they are.<br>
<br>
You should learn more about a subject before speaking rudely about <br>
it to someone.  If a person&#x27;s intent is to get the best cube he can <br>
for speedcubing, you go through them and test them as you have done <br>
through the years.  If a person is a collector of old games and <br>
antiques, you do not OPEN them!  Condition is everything.  If you <br>
open an old, first edition Rubik&#x27;s Cube package, (or an old Barbie <br>
doll, etc.) it just lost 75% of its value!  <br>
<br>
Now, the Buvos Kocka I spoke of that is worth between $500-$1000 is <br>
NOT the $7.99 Buvos Kocka Studio that they are pumping out of <br>
Hungary.  I have two of those that I paid $9.99 for that I use for <br>
speeding--and they are good for that. (Incidently, the ink isn&#x27;t <br>
even dry on the Studio package!  Take that for what it&#x27;s worth, but <br>
I won&#x27;t go there.)  Anyway, the 7.99 ones you speak of are the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Studio Buvos Kocka.  The older PRE-IDEAL, pre-1980, Buvos <br>
Kocka are way different; you probably won&#x27;t see these on Ebay, and I <br>
doubt you have 90 of them either.  But, you can see two different <br>
styles of these expensive and rare cubes at: <br>
<br>
http://home.houston.rr.com/texasgrape/  There are five pictures <br>
there and they are titled: <br>
<br>
Buvos Kocka and Buvos Kocka 2 are the rare ones, and yes, expensive <br>
ones.  Hungary Tub, and USA Tub are not as rare, but are very hard <br>
to find UNOPENED, UNTOUCHED, and in MINT condition.  Check eBAY if <br>
you don&#x27;t believe me.  Maybe one in a thousand Rubik posts are these <br>
types.  And yes, to a collector they are worth from $75-$300 <br>
depending on their condition and WHERE they are made.  Not going to <br>
argue the point with anyone whether they are worth it or not.  I <br>
personally wouldn&#x27;t pay $2,000 for a Barbie Doll, or $10,000 for a <br>
baseball card, but some do.  <br>
<br>
Okay, the last picture titled Buvos Kocka Studio is the $7.99 one.  <br>
However, I usually have to pay the guy in Hungary $9.99 plus $6.00 <br>
shipping.  :-(  But, for 16 bucks I have a decent speedcube.<br>
<br>
Okay GosD, in the past you have given me lessons on speedcubing, now <br>
this is your lesson in collecting vintage games.  I&#x27;m not going to <br>
post anymore on this subject because this is a speedcubing club, but <br>
I felt I needed to inform some who were not informed on this <br>
subject.  It should also help those to know what is authentic and <br>
what is not.  GosD: If you have 90 MINT, Unopened, Pre-Ideal, Buvos <br>
Kockas stashed away in your closet (the ones in the light blue <br>
package as in the picture) you can retire on their worth, amigo!  <br>
However, if you have opened them all, played with them, and made <br>
them worthless . . . oh well, that&#x27;s life.  Perhaps they will make <br>
good speedcubes.  <br>
<br>
Lastly . . . GosD, you shouldn&#x27;t quit this club.  You should be <br>
helping the apeedcubing rookies like me.  You have given good advice <br>
in the past to help us, and you should continue. <br>

Subject: [Speed Solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube] Gosd&#x27;s apology and $$ for vintage
cubes
 
GosD: Your apology is accepted.  You have irritated the hell out of 
me more than once with your bluntness, rudeness, and mis-stated 
facts.  However, you have my respect because of your accomplishments 
and for the help you have given me in the past, and for the 
sincerity of your note.  Anyone can have a bad day.  

In your last post you asked for facts; here they are.

You should learn more about a subject before speaking rudely about 
it to someone.  If a person&#x27;s intent is to get the best cube he can 
for speedcubing, you go through them and test them as you have done 
through the years.  If a person is a collector of old games and 
antiques, you do not OPEN them!  Condition is everything.  If you 
open an old, first edition Rubik&#x27;s Cube package, (or an old Barbie 
doll, etc.) it just lost 75% of its value!  

Now, the Buvos Kocka I spoke of that is worth between $500-$1000 is 
NOT the $7.99 Buvos Kocka Studio that they are pumping out of 
Hungary.  I have two of those that I paid $9.99 for that I use for 
speeding--and they are good for that. (Incidently, the ink isn&#x27;t 
even dry on the Studio package!  Take that for what it&#x27;s worth, but 
I won&#x27;t go there.)  Anyway, the 7.99 ones you speak of are the 
Rubik&#x27;s Studio Buvos Kocka.  The older PRE-IDEAL, pre-1980, Buvos 
Kocka are way different; you probably won&#x27;t see these on Ebay, and I 
doubt you have 90 of them either.  But, you can see two different 
styles of these expensive and rare cubes at: 

http://home.houston.rr.com/texasgrape/  There are five pictures 
there and they are titled: 

Buvos Kocka and Buvos Kocka 2 are the rare ones, and yes, expensive 
ones.  Hungary Tub, and USA Tub are not as rare, but are very hard 
to find UNOPENED, UNTOUCHED, and in MINT condition.  Check eBAY if 
you don&#x27;t believe me.  Maybe one in a thousand Rubik posts are these 
types.  And yes, to a collector they are worth from $75-$300 
depending on their condition and WHERE they are made.  Not going to 
argue the point with anyone whether they are worth it or not.  I 
personally wouldn&#x27;t pay $2,000 for a Barbie Doll, or $10,000 for a 
baseball card, but some do.  

Okay, the last picture titled Buvos Kocka Studio is the $7.99 one.  
However, I usually have to pay the guy in Hungary $9.99 plus $6.00 
shipping.  :-(  But, for 16 bucks I have a decent speedcube.

Okay GosD, in the past you have given me lessons on speedcubing, now 
this is your lesson in collecting vintage games.  I&#x27;m not going to 
post anymore on this subject because this is a speedcubing club, but 
I felt I needed to inform some who were not informed on this 
subject.  It should also help those to know what is authentic and 
what is not.  GosD: If you have 90 MINT, Unopened, Pre-Ideal, Buvos 
Kockas stashed away in your closet (the ones in the light blue 
package as in the picture) you can retire on their worth, amigo!  
However, if you have opened them all, played with them, and made 
them worthless . . . oh well, that&#x27;s life.  Perhaps they will make 
good speedcubes.  

Lastly . . . GosD, you shouldn&#x27;t quit this club.  You should be 
helping the apeedcubing rookies like me.  You have given good advice 
in the past to help us, and you should continue.

In fact, I&#x27;ve only seen a couple from Hungary in the tub, but <br>

all you didn&#x27;t have to help.  This consists from the founder of the <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everybody, <br>
<br>
I am very happy. I became an another sub20 cubist. <br>
{17.64 19.08 17.95 21.11 (16.81) 21.52  19.75 (22.91) 18.35 20.19 <br>
19.40 21.36}= 19.63<br>
<br>
I would like to share some tips. <br>
<br>
#CUBE<br>
I use hybrid cube. Center piece is from &#x27;80s cube, The other pieces <br>
are from new cube. I reuse center piece several times. A first few <br>
days, it tends to pop. But in several days, it will be a very nice <br>
speed cube. If you have extra &#x27;80s cube, your new hybride cube will <br>
be in best condition within one day. I never use sandpapers. I have <br>
another 80&#x27;s cube but I don&#x27;t want to use it until wc2003. <br>
<br>
#PLACE<br>
It was previously discussed. My time is always better at outdoor than <br>
indoor. My eyes works fine under the sunshine. Don&#x27;t sit in front of <br>
your computer. Let&#x27;s get out with your cube! <br>
<br>
#METHOD<br>
I use Guus&#x27; method. F2L+Corners+ Edges. We,Japanese people, call CLL <br>
and ELL (like OLL and PLL). 13 of 42 CLL algs, do not move edges. 7 <br>
of 43 do not flip edges. So I can predict which ELL alg should be <br>
used during CLL. Sometimes I can find ELL alg before CLL has been <br>
done. <br>
<br>
I still start making cross at top, but finish at bottom. Recently, I <br>
became to memorize or imagine how F2L corners are at B face. So I can <br>
make good pair of corner and edge, without flipping and seeing when <br>
they are not on U. I still often re-grip cube for permution during <br>
F2L but rarely flip just to see behind. <br>

<br>
What method were you using when you averaged 52?  I guess you changed <br>
to doing the cross?....your right, the best thing you can do is <br>
practice and repitition.  You really need to force yourself to look <br>
ahead in the f2l, get to where you don&#x27;t have to think about the <br>
moves and look for the next pieces.  Leaning the LL in 2 looks helps <br>
alot too.  There&#x27;s one other possible variable that could of helped <br>
me get those couple seconds faster.....in that last average I <br>
listened to two songs over and over....Machinehead by Bush, and The <br>
Way You Like It by Adema...lol....when ever I cube I listen to up <br>
beat songs, it kinda allows you to get a rhythm with turning the cube <br>
and the music.<br>
<br>
thanks for the congrats...<br>

          <div class="email-content">What is going on?<br>
i made that post 2 days ago, it pops up now?<br>
Last night, i made a revised post.. that didnt show yet.<br>
so i will say it again<br>
<br>
Please take this 1 question survey about your favorite Professor <br>
cube color scheme. This WILL determine the new color scheme on <br>
Meffert&#x27;s Professor cube when they come back to production (as soon <br>
as this poll has enough voters, he will start making them) please <br>
take the time to answer it, it may be a bit laggy (the server)<br>

What method were you using when you averaged 52?  I guess you changed <br>
to doing the cross?....your right, the best thing you can do is <br>
practice and repitition.  You really need to force yourself to look <br>
ahead in the f2l, get to where you don&#x27;t have to think about the <br>
moves and look for the next pieces.  Leaning the LL in 2 looks helps <br>
alot too.  There&#x27;s one other possible variable that could of helped <br>
me get those couple seconds faster.....in that last average I <br>
listened to two songs over and over....Machinehead by Bush, and The <br>
Way You Like It by Adema...lol....when ever I cube I listen to up <br>
beat songs, it kinda allows you to get a rhythm with turning the cube <br>
and the music.<br>
<br>
thanks for the congrats...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi I have only been cubing for 6 months and I just broke the 40s <br>
barrier using the corners first method.  My best average is 36.5s, <br>

I am trying to replace them but the old stickers are really hard to <br>
get off.  So I was just wondering what people did when restickering <br>
an old cube.  How do you get the old stickers off? <br>

<br>
I take them off with my fingernail; not as tedious as it sounds, but <br>
doesn&#x27;t damage the cube as a knife may.  I use alcohol on a soft rag <br>
to get the old glue off.  There still may be a film of glue left <br>
over, but to me, it helps bond the new stickers.  I have had <br>
excellent results doing it this way and the stickers last longer <br>
than the originals!  I use the stickers from Rubiks.com.  Downside:  <br>
They are expensive, and they charge 6 bucks for shipping to boot--<br>
but they are indeed good!  Someone posted and said they&#x27;d send you <br>
one set of stickers for free if you include an SASE.  I haven&#x27;t <br>
tried doing that yet; I didn&#x27;t find that out until after I bought <br>
mine.  Give them a call and see and let us know:  Toll free:  866-<br>
437-7767.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt to ask.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Please, folks, this is the only thing I feel really strongly about <br>
regarding Rubiks cubes.<br>
We must choose the yellow vs white instead of blue vs white.<br>
Think about the symmetry: yellow vs white, green vs blue, red vs <br>
orange are similar in that they differ by the constant color of <br>
yellow. I do not believe any other such pattern is available with the <br>
six colors that must make up the cube.<br>
Please vote for Yellow vs White at this link that Tyler provided:<br>

Thanks for your interest and questions. 

When I made that web site on Dec 2001, I used those moves. 
Although I changed some, I still use 80% of them. 
I would like to add another moves which I really use as Katsu&#x27;s 
evolution page. 
http://www5.gateway.ne.jp/~katsu-k/

I used a lot of mirror image moves using either right or left hand. 
(I am right hander.) Recently, I prefer unsymmetric moves with right 
hand. Basically, I grip cube with thumb at F, but I often regrip. 

Here is another tip. Evenif the slot to be solved is FR or FL, I 
regrip and finish it at B face as possible. So I can see the other 
unsolved slots. I think effective regrip may be useful.

          <div class="email-content">thats cool that u guys only spent a couple months or a year and can <br>
solve the cube so fast.  Were you taught by someone?  I had to come <br>
up with all my stuff on my own.  Than after i was able to solve, i <br>
started using the net to bring down my times, and learn new algs.  It <br>
is so painful trying to drop sequences i have used for almost three <br>
years, but its worth it trying to reach sub 20.  With all the stuff i <br>
know, i taught several people at school how to solve the cube in <br>
around a week or two, and most of them are under a min. 30.  <br>

 its funny sometimes when people are in awe of those who can solve the cube...i can do it in 2.5 mins which is a helluva long time...but whenever someone who&#x27;s never tried solving it (or even those who have) see me do it, their eyes almost pop out and you&#x27;re automatically labelled a genius! it&#x27;s a tremendous ego boost! of course, little do they know the world record is sub 20!

          <div class="email-content">i already know a simple F2L 6-step method, lars petrus method, and a <br>
basic F2L then 4 look for last layer method. i&#x27;m rather inexperienced <br>
at lars method, so my fastest method is the 6-step, which i peak at <br>
around 40-45 sec. i&#x27;m looking for someone to teach me how to progress <br>
and break the 30 sec barrier. maybe tips on new methods or how to <br>
incorporate faster algorithms into the 6-step? any help is <br>
appreciated. thanks.<br>
<br>
PS- i took a quick look at the algorithms on speedcubing.com and i&#x27;m <br>
looking for an alternative to blindly memorizing 70 or so algorithms <br>
for the last layer. maybe tips on understanding them or working up to <br>
them. thanks again.<br>

          <div class="email-content">For you last layer, you can learn the 3-look instead of the 4.  I <br>
dropped around 7-10 seconds off my average by doing this.   All <br>
you have to learn is about 9 orientation algs and all the perms <br>
which only adds up to 30 algs.  It took me about 2 weeks to learn <br>
them all.  I think it was worth it.  <br>

For your F2L I dont understand what you do.  But with a 45 <br>

          <div class="email-content">Cool!<br>
<br>
I like interesting and different cubes, but they always take me <br>
longer to solve. For me, the solid colours are such a key part of <br>
minimising the number of looks and the time taken for each look.<br>
<br>
The position of the colours makes a difference to my times too. My <br>
favourite speedcubing cube that I&#x27;ve been using for years has the <br>
white/yellow configuration. As it was becoming a bit worse for wear I <br>
bought a new one. It&#x27;s a white/blue. I&#x27;ve sovvled it probably a few <br>
dozen times since I bought it and I&#x27;m a bit more used to it now, but <br>
it still feels kinda weird. The white/yellow configuration is just so <br>
thoroughly ingrained in my head after so many years. Using something <br>
different is like writing with my left hand (I&#x27;m right handed) -- I <br>
can do it, but takes longer, it isn&#x27;t as neat and it feels unnatural!<br>

          <div class="email-content">As recommended, I used silicone spray on my new cube. It certainly <br>
did make it smoother and much nicer for cubing. It also appears to <br>
have stained the edges of the stickers (no, I didn&#x27;t spray the <br>
stickers, the spray got on them when I was working the spray in the <br>
mechanism). At first I thought the spray just needed to dry, but it&#x27;s <br>
been weeks now and the stickers still look stained. Is this normal?<br>

          <div class="email-content">actually, my F2L is an excellent beginner method. it only involves<br>
memorizing one or two moves and can be learned by anyone in a day or two.<br>
it goes basically like this<br>
step 1 - top edges<br>
step 2 - 3 top corners<br>
step 3 - 3 middle edges<br>
(such that you have one corner/edge pair unsolved)<br>
step 4 - bottom edges (oriented and positioned)<br>
step 5 - position all corners<br>
step 6 - orient all corners<br>
i should probably publish this method, its very good for an introduction<br>
to the cube.<br>
<br>
anyway, i found some final layer permutation algorithms, totaling about<br>
16. and i already know algorithms to orient corners and edges. so you<br>
think that if i learn all these permutations i can cut 10 seconds off my<br>
time? is there any way you&#x27;d recommend learning them? besides just going<br>
through one by one and memorizing, of course. and you said that you were<br>
able to learn all the permutation algorithms in two weeks? thats not bad<br>
at all. any other advice is welcome, thanks.<br>

the tartan took around 9 to 10 min, where the lasker cube (i have a <br>
slightly better strategy with) solved it in 6 min.  I&#x27;m sure i could <br>
bring those times significantly down but im just happy to solve <br>
them,  my main focus is trying to sub 40 on the normal cube first.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You can recognize the position from looking at just two sides, but I<br>
cannot do this for all positions. I always try to find such a view of<br>
the cube that exhibits the lowest &quot;entropy&quot;, looking for the blocks of<br>
solved cubies (those that are already together). Then I usually have<br>
one clue - I look at a particular edge if it is opposite color or not,<br>
which determines the algorithm and also my first move. This is<br>
especially useful for that complicated permutation with a three-cycle<br>
of edges and a three-cycle of corners, that you need to carry out both<br>
ways and in a mirror version. Recognizing the position can be very<br>
fast, but you _need_to_know_ the colors of the cube by heart. I think<br>
it is just practice. <br>
<br>
BTW, to contribute to the discussion about progress, here is my 2c<br>
worth: I got to about 1 minute (average) after 3 months, to 35 seconds<br>
after about 6 months, and to an average of 25 after 10 months. Then I<br>
changed to my current F2L system and instantly improved by about 3-4<br>
seconds to low 20&#x27;s. To get consistently below 20, it took me probably<br>
1.5 years and I reached my best of 17 on average after 18-20 months.<br>
It was in the Spring of 1983 ... :)<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>
<br>
&gt; I also lose time prior to the permutation, sometimes 3 or 4 sec even, <br>
&gt; carrying out the steps you outline.  Since I avg at least 7 sec slower <br>
&gt; than you, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t help much.  I too would like to be able <br>
&gt; to instantly recognize each perm without having to turn the U.  I <br>
&gt; wonder what the sub 20 crowd does: cubinforspeed, Jessica, Jess, etc. <br>

          <div class="email-content">I am not sure if I understand your question, but I will try to answer.<br>
<br>
Most F2L algorithms can, indeed, be carried out using just two sides.<br>
In some cases, they may not be the shortest ones but still can be<br>
faster because of the fact that only two sides are involved and<br>
because they are &quot;obvious&quot;. The algorithms for the F2L are on my page<br>
and on several more pages, such as Chris&#x27;. But you do not realy need<br>
to mechanically memorize all of them. Actually, I discourage you from<br>
doing this because I noticed that once there is a set of well-defined<br>
moves, people tend to stop thinking about what they are doing and<br>
instead try to mechanically apply what they learned. <br>
<br>
A more valuable approach is to learn a few trivial moves how to<br>
separate the corner and the edge in the LL and how to flip them. Just<br>
play with the cube slowly, observe what is going on and remember that,<br>
especially in the beginning, most corner-edge pairs are not in yet, so<br>
you can use even simpler moves for insertion than when you are<br>
inserting the last pair. There are two basic simple ways how to insert<br>
a corner-edge pair. If you combine some auxiliary short moves with<br>
those two insertion mechanisms, you will discover the moves for most<br>
F2L algorithms. And they will seem natural to you because you came up<br>
with them. If some of them are too long, you can learn a few<br>
not-so-obvious tricks from my F2L algorithms.<br>
<br>
When I switched to this system from my old F2L system (first the first<br>
layer including the corners, then inserting two edges into the middle<br>
at the same time), I improved virtually instantly (a week or two) from<br>
an average of 25 to about 21. Most of the moves that I started using<br>
seemed obvious and &quot;natural&quot;. But then, by the time I switched to this<br>
F2L system, I was already an &quot;experienced&quot; cuber. I do realize that<br>
for those of you who learn this system as your first one, may have<br>
troubles with it at first. All you need is practice - Gosh, I hate<br>
this answer. Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
I posted a solution to the two-generator group at<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/two-generator.html<br>
<br>
The two-generator group means scrambling and solving the cube only <br>
using moves of two connecting sides, f.i. R and U.<br>
Just try it, it is not as easy as you may think.<br>
<br>
The cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system is actually a very good system to solve <br>
two-generator. But since you are only allowed to use R and U moves <br>
you may need to find some other algorithms than you are used to.<br>
After some practice it should be possible to solve the two-generator <br>
group in 10 seconds on average.<br>
<br>
For those who have problems solving F2L in general, solving F2L <br>
without rotating, or solving other corner/edge pairs than FR, the two-<br>
generator group will be a very good practice.<br>
You can also solve the two-generator L and U group to practice left <br>
handed shortcuts and finger tricks.<br>
<br>
Soon I will post a three-generator solution for the F,U and R group.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

          <div class="email-content">UGH, workin 60 hrs. a week sucks. picked up the cube today... felt <br>
real fast but everything was 40 seconds plus. still gotta learn F2L.<br>
WELL... I see on speedcubing.com it refers to the F2L and says &quot;You <br>
can also use only parts of this system, which takes less memorizing, <br>
but more moves&quot;. If any F2L page included a section of the least <br>
amount of algs to learn I think it could be a huge stepping stone for <br>
those who want to learn it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">there is a way where all you have to learn is 20 F2L algs<br>
<br>
what I do is put the corner piece in the U layer, with the D layer <br>
color in either the F or R faces.  This is with the cross on the <br>
bottom.  When you have that D color in either the F or R faces <br>
there is only 20 algs to remember.  <br>
This is similar to doing the LL in 3 looks by first making a cross <br>
on the top then only memorizing 9 orientation algs.  <br>
So yeah you only have to know 20 algs but it takes about 3-6 <br>
more moves per pair to get them into position.  <br>
I think this is what they mean when they say you can use only <br>
part of this system.  <br>
But so far its so hard to practice the F2L algs because its hard to <br>
put the pairs into position to practice the move.  You just have to <br>
keep solving the cube over and over and use the F2L algs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A few tips on this:  First, it may help you to use moves that involve 
just two faces, like R and U, avoiding moves that use more than 3 
faces.  This may make it easier to spot the pieces.  Second, have the 
moves down cold, so you don&#x27;t have to think about them.  That way, 
while you&#x27;re doing a move, you can actively look for the next pair, 
rather than watching the pair you are inserting.  Third, don&#x27;t do a 
move so fast that the other pieces are flying around and you can&#x27;t at 
least have a general idea of where they are ending up.  Fourth, I 
think knowing how to insert pairs from various angles may help
(rather 
than rotating the cube all the time), but I&#x27;m still experimenting
with 
that.  The ugly truth is whatever you do, it takes time.  In my case 
years and counting.  But stick with it, and good luck.

I use low grade sandpaper for the big nodules sticking out, then go over the pieces with the finest grade I can find and that seems to work fine. Alternatively I finish it with emery cloth which is very good.<br>
Using an old piece of sandpaper seems to help, as once it is worn it is a little less abrasive.<br>

<br>
<br>
  I just went to the hardware store today to buy some fine grit<br>
  sandpaper and some silicone spray for my cube hoping I could make it a<br>
  bit faster.  I bought the highest grade that I saw which was 1200.  I<br>
  sanded a couple of pieces, but they seem to be less smooth after<br>
  sanding them.  Do I need to use higher grade sandpaper, or am I just<br>
  imagining things?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok sorry!!!

Its the edge corner pairs I mean! When you have done the cross and 
starts with the pairs, what are the first kind of structure (relation 
between egde-corner) you looking for?

I seem to want to begin finding one &quot;free&quot; corner in the bottom layer
(cross on top) and then find the related edge.

Hope you´ll understand what I,m trying to explain!

I guess people will tackle this problem in many different ways, and many of the ways would be equally valid. What I do is exactly what you describe (except that I have cross on bottom); I find a corner in the U layer and then search for the corresponding edge. Sometimes whilst searching for the corresponging edge I spot a corner-edge pair and do that first instead, but more often the first pair I know the location of will be the one with the corner in the U layer that I originally spotted. Or if I did spot another pair first and didn&#x27;t like it I would keep searching for that edge.<br>
If I can&#x27;t spot a corner that is in the U layer (D layer for you) I simply bang the first corner that I find into the U layer whilst looking for the edge. If I know where the edge is already then I might use a more elegant solution, but if I don&#x27;t then I just bang the corner into that layer as that means I am doing moves and thus am solving the cube. Sometimes I know where the edge is and instead of wasting time deciding what the elegant move is I just bang the corner up anyway as it works out well most of the time and thus on average is quicker for me.<br>
For the subsequent pairs I hope that I have worked out the algs for the next pair before I start on it - generally I try to find a corner that will be in the U layer when I have finished the current corner-edge pair I am placing. If I can&#x27;t find one, I just bang any old corner that needs solving up into the U layer whilst hunting for its corresponding edge. There may be more elegant and shorter moves that don&#x27;t involve this, but I am familiar with the situations that occur when the corner is in the U layer, and thus am able to devote my attentions to finding the next pair better.<br>
Most of the time I have the next pair spotted before I finish the current pair. On occassions I don&#x27;t. You have a choice of various strategies in that situation: you could keep looking until you spot a pair, you could place a single edge, you could place a single corner, you could put a corner into the U layer. If you just keep looking until you spot a pair you may just remain blind to where the cube you are looking for is for ages - normally you spot almost instantly or it takes forever. The other options have the benefit of moving you nearer to completing the cube, and also have the benefit of moving pieces around so that the piece you couldn&#x27;t find springs into view.<br>
<br>
In summary, I think I am saying get the corner into the U layer first, and if you can&#x27;t spot the associated edge then simply place the corner in its correct slot. (You can always use a working edge later on to place the edge when you finally spot it). Other people will have other ideas, so try this out and make your own mind up.<br>
<br>
Somebody else I was in email correspondence with thought that your question meant:<br>
&quot;after the cross has been done, do you go for F2L positions that have both <br>
pieces in the layer opposite the cross first or for one that have at least <br>
one piece in the correct place (but perhaps not correctly oriented) (if the <br>
choice of the two options is open)?&quot;<br>
This is another good question. I should think there is a lot of variation here between the faster cubers.<br>
 <br>
As stated above, I am looking for corners first, and I look in the U layer. If I don&#x27;t find one there then I look in the D layer. So I (almost) always go for the situation where one corner is in the U layer and the the edge is anywhere (but preferably in the U layer too). If pieces are in the correct slot but orientated incorrectly it means nothing to me except that I will know where to find the piece later - which is very pleasing. If an edge or corner is in the correct slot and orientated correctly then that is where the &quot;almost&quot; earlier applies. Depending on my mood (very scientific!), and also upon cube specifics (like where the other piece is) I will do one of the following: I will find the other piece and place it using a working corner or edge, I will look to see if there if an edge from one slot solved and a corner from another slot solved and solve the corresponding 2 slots in one go using &quot;non-matching pairs&quot; (see my site if you don&#x27;t know what I mean), I will place an easy pair that I have spotted, I will find another pair and try to organise it so that I disturb another slot whilst doing that pair in the hope that I will solve a corner or edge in that slot leaving me able to solve 2 slots in one go yet again using &quot;non-matching pairs&quot;. Often this means I leave the slot to the end and thus haven&#x27;t taken advantage of one of the pieces being accidently solved. Something for me to wok on I guess.<br>
<br>
Somebody else who I was in chat with thought your question was something about how to you form the cross.<br>
Since it wasn&#x27;t I won&#x27;t mention any specifics on doing the cross except to say that you should be able to spot at least a corner before the cross is completed. Also, it is possible to work out where a pair of pieces will be when the cross is completed by tracking their movement before you start doing the cube. I have tried this but cannot do anywhere near the 15 seconds preinspection I give myself except in really easy cases.<br>
<br>
I hope this post has given you something to think about and that you find some of this suits you. .<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!!

Thanks for youre descriptions on the F2L!

I didn´t mean the cross ok, you described the right stuff, Ok!

I start by finding eather an edge or a corner in the U-layer(youre 
way) then I try to find the corresponding edge or corner by searching 
the cube counterclockwise until I find it, while doing this I find 
the next cubies to connect. And so it goes until F2L is solved, 
perhaps a bit timeconsuming? what do you think? What should I work on 
to improve my F2L times? 


I avg tot. about 28´, but my weakness are the F2L it takes about 18-
20sec, and the last layer takes about 9-10sec. I think it depends on 
the fact that I recently begun learning the F2L system, but that 
seems to improving to. Before using it I had times at 37´and to start 
with it became 48´ now I,ve worked myselfe down to 28´(tot). I think 
practise is the thing I have to do, but it is interesting knowing how 
faster people are doing.

Subject: [Speed Solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube] 5x5x5 speed cubing
 
Since my 4x4x4 is currently busted (weak center pieces consperacy) I 
thought i would try jumpin up and speed solve the 5x5x5. I don&#x27;t have 
a good speedy solution and was wonderin if anyone could help or share 
there solutions.  My times are in the 15 min range but its a start at 
least, right!?!  I use the centers first method and than i complete 
layer by layer, in case if you wondering what solution i use.  Thanks 
much

          <div class="email-content">Well, it could break your cube.  I think that it could erode the 
plastic.  Vaseline does the same thing.  This could actually improve 
how your cube works.  You&#x27;ll have to try for yourself to find out.  
Just don&#x27;t be surprised if you lube up your cube with baby oil, put 
it in a box for a few years, take it out and it is mush.

Silicone spray lubricant won&#x27;t damage your cube, and most people seem 
to like how it works pretty well.

Will it damage your cube for sure?  I know vaseline is not good, 
because it is a petroleum based lubricant which attacks plastic.  
Is baby oil petroleum based?

Click here

It says mineral oil, but it also says fragranced, is that the bad 
part?

Well, I&#x27;ve found plenty of internet sites that say not to use it with 
condoms for this reason.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know if the baby oil damages the cube or not, but I started 
using it because I didn&#x27;t have silicone oil at the time; and I&#x27;ve 
been using it ever since.  It works for me and smells better than the 
silicon oil (and good for your skin also).  So far, my cube is still 
good and I&#x27;ve been lubing it with baby oil for about 6 months now =)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve read all the posts in the past six months on lubes, and I&#x27;ve <br>
tried them all but the wax. I found something different that I like <br>
the best:  Armor All!  And is safe for all plastics:  stickers and <br>
cubes.<br>
<br>
The first lube I used was 3 in 1 oil (a light sewing machine oil)  I <br>
used it for 2 weeks and then took my cube apart, cleaned it with a <br>
toothbrush and mild soapy water.  (The 3 in 1 did make the stickers <br>
peel eventually, but no biggie, cuz I wanted to put new ones on <br>
anyway.) Then I reassembled it completely dry.  I turned the layers <br>
45 degrees and with a small paintbrush, dobbed ARMOR ALL on the flat <br>
surfaces showing.   Then I turned the other layers 45 and did the <br>
same.  Armor All works best for me . . . and I&#x27;ve tried most all of <br>
them.  To me, it works better than silicone.  <br>
<br>
I have found that you need to break the cube in somewhat before <br>
applying anything.  When the squares are new and completely smooth <br>
and flat, the lubricant seems to create a suction making it hard to <br>
turn.  The &#x27;wear&#x27; grooves (from dry break in) keeps this from <br>
happening.<br>
<br>
I got another cube and recreated the same effect.  (The above cube <br>
is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.)  Yep, worked again.  Now, a word on <br>
cubes:  I&#x27;ve found that ALL cubes do not respond the same no matter <br>
what you use for lubricant just because of the way they are made and <br>
the spring tension.  If you have a cube that turns pretty good dry, <br>
then it would be a candidate for a lube.  Some cubes are just <br>
hopeless.  Also, one of my favorite cubes I use dry!  I put Armor <br>
All on it just to help . . .and it does.  <br>
<br>
In my opinion, a bad cube ain&#x27;t gonna get good by using a lube, but <br>
a good cube can be enhanced with a lube if it is a good one to begin <br>
with.  For what it&#x27;s worth.  :-)<br>
<br>
Texasgrape<br>
<br>
PS  According to the posts, baby oil seems to work well too.  Gonna <br>
try it out.  I&#x27;m not afraid to use a light oil--it&#x27;s the harsh ones <br>
that will hurt a cube, not the light ones.  If baby oil is good for <br>
a new born baby&#x27;s skin, it ain&#x27;t gonna hurt plastic!<br>

If you&#x27;re at all considering speed cubing the 5x5x5 then I would 
suggest lubing your cube.  I like to think I&#x27;m a 5x5x5 speedcubist (I 
don&#x27;t practice it as much as the 3x3x3 but I still like trying to 
solve it quickly).  Since I&#x27;ve lubed my 5x5x5 though it is so much 
easier to speed solve.  It takes a much greater measure of dexterity 
because the thing is so loose that it breaks very easily and putting 
it back together is so hard it&#x27;s painful.  As far as solutions go 
it&#x27;s my experience that a centers first solution goes quicker than an 
edges first solution but that&#x27;s just me.  Richard Carr is much better 
at big cubes than I, but I would suggest solving the centers, then 
the edges, then the cube like a 3x3x3.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m going to combat the advertizing and rejoin to give some tips <br>
on this.<br>
<br>
(Post 1 of ? - Centres)<br>
<br>
The first tip is to use a virtual cube. :  )<br>
I find that even with the Revenge, if I try to speed cube it is liable <br>
to break into pieces very quickly (when I say break I mean with <br>
some actual pieces physically breaking rather than coming <br>
apart) although maybe a lubed cube would be better. There&#x27;s no <br>
way I&#x27;m going to try to get top speed on my real 5x5x5 (as I might <br>
never get another one). That&#x27;s now reserved for project blindfold, <br>
if I can achieve some consistency on the Revenge first.<br>
Thus, try a virtual cube like the one at oinkleburger (if you want to <br>
go higher than 5 you have to anyway). Oinkleburger is hard to get <br>
used to but it gets easier when you have to build the centres as <br>
then you don&#x27;t have to set off at crazy speeds and the geometric <br>
confusion that plays a part in the smaller cubes is less of an <br>
issue.<br>
<br>
The second thing is to build the centres first. I used to build them <br>
last and I got awful times that way. Building them first is the way <br>
to go as Chris Hardwick points out. I build my centres differently <br>
from Chris though (and it is probably here I make up time <br>
because he can blitz me on the 3x3x3 - also the centres are the <br>
time-determining factors on big cubes (they take O(n^2) moves <br>
to solve but the edges only take O(n) and the 3x3x3 solution O(1) <br>
moves - i.e. the centres take quadratic time, the edges linear <br>
time and the rest constant time).<br>
<br>
Choose any centre to start off with (build it on the F face) and <br>
build the centre horizontal stripe of 3 - push it to the L face) and <br>
build the other horizontal layers of 3 (one at a time) on the F face, <br>
pushing each to the L face as you complete them. Then move <br>
the L face up to the U face so the U centre is completed.<br>
<br>
Now do the D centre - recently I have thought of a better way to <br>
start this. Again build in strips of 3 starting at the centre one. It <br>
may be possible to build the 2 outer parts of the centre strip on <br>
one of the F,B,R or L faces. Then you can slice up the centre of <br>
the D face, rotate and slice back down to complete the centre <br>
strip. In other situations you might want to do something else. <br>
(e.g. slice a non-centre slice from the D face rotate the D face <br>
and slice back).<br>
<br>
Try, where possible to leave a clean strip of three in the D face <br>
after getting the centre strip. You can then push a complete strip <br>
in there rotate and take out any other mess from the other side.<br>
For the last part, push out the 2nd complete strip, rotate and pull <br>
back in to complete the second centre.<br>
<br>
The third and 4th centres should be built adjacently (this part <br>
definitely differs from Chris&#x27;s - I can&#x27;t see how to generalize his <br>
method for bigger cubes than 5x5x5). Build the 3rd one before <br>
the 4th (i.e. completely before), centre strip first. Then do the 4th <br>
one. You have to complete the last 2 together. For the 5x5x5 it is <br>
still small enough that there are tricks to enable you to do this <br>
quite fast. For larger cubes you may need to spend a little time <br>
with fidgety conjugation moves near the end but it is still quite <br>
fast.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
(Part 2- Edges)<br>
<br>
Build the edges one at a time (for the Revenge you can build <br>
them 2 at a time, but it&#x27;s more complicated to try that here, if at all <br>
possible).<br>
Build the first 8 in the middle layers and store them in the U and <br>
D faces.<br>
The basic plan is to slice layers parallel to the U and D faces. <br>
Fast location of pieces is also vitally important here for really <br>
good times. <br>
For instance, suppose the FR edge has a Red-Green piece in <br>
the centre. Try to locate a Red-Green piece in the U or D layer <br>
and place it in the FL edge (with a LD&#x27;L&#x27; type of move) in such a <br>
way that then you can slice it into the correct place. Sometimes, <br>
you&#x27;ll have the pieces all in the middle layer anyway and you may <br>
be able to just slice. If the central edge doesn&#x27;t match the  other <br>
edges, you&#x27;ll need to flip it. This can be done quite effectively:<br>
<br>
match the other two edge pieces, say in the FR edge and put the <br>
centre edge in the FL edge. Then L^2(slice the middle layer <br>
twice)L^2 will complete that edge without messing things up.<br>
<br>
If the two non-centre edges are in the same layer, get one of <br>
them correctly aligned with the centre edge and then rotate the <br>
non-middle slice (not containing either non-centre edge) so that <br>
the U and D strips (of the middle layers) look the same. You can <br>
then freely do a half rotation of any of the F, B, R or L sides <br>
without messing up the centres. Use this to get one of the centre <br>
edges in a different layer but not the other. Then slice to <br>
complete the edge.<br>
When you have 8 edges done and stored, reslice the middle <br>
layers to complete the centres.<br>
Chris Hardwick&#x27;s page describes the technique you&#x27;ll want to <br>
use for the last 4 edges.<br>
The very last edge may not look right (the centre edge may look <br>
flipped compared to the others). You may as well fix it now <br>
(similarly for any cube of odd side-length) as recognizing it <br>
doesn&#x27;t take anything special. Again, Chris Hardwick has a move <br>
on the Revenge for flipping an edge which can be adapted for <br>
this. You can try to build more than one of the last 4 edges at the <br>
same time.<br>
<br>

(Part 3 - Finishing off)<br>
<br>
Treat the thing as a 3x3x3 and go as fast as you can. If you know <br>
all the algorithms (unlike me) and can trigger (again unlike me, <br>
in most cases) it should help your time.<br>
When my mouse isn&#x27;t playing up (which it often does - Apple <br>
don&#x27;t seem to be capable of making decent mice, although I <br>
haven&#x27;t got an optical or cordless one which would probably <br>
help) I find that it is possible to sometimes execute some moves <br>
pretty fast - though not as fast as for a real cube.<br>
<br>
(For big even cubes, if you have an edge that needs (parts of it) <br>
flipping, ensure that it is a LL edge. Then after completing the <br>
rest of the edges do the F2L. From the orientation of the 3 other <br>
LL edges you will see which way to flip (parts of) the last edge, if <br>
it needs to be done at all.<br>
Then do the orientation step (or steps if like me you often need <br>
2).<br>
In the PLL stage identify if you will need to switch 2 edges first <br>
and if so do that before permuting. If you don&#x27;t you may have to <br>
switch them afterwards and then you either need to have a lot of <br>
algorithms at hand or you may need to permute again wasting <br>
time.)<br>

I only just bought a mefferts megaminx this weekend!  Its about 3 
inches high, very luminous, textured stickers on it same colours 
on opposites.  It cost me £8 ($12 perhaps?) at a local shop.  I&#x27;ve 
never had one, not scrambled it yet, not sure what others feel 
like, but, it turns nice and smooth, quite a dry action, easy, I don&#x27;t 
understand how anyone could speed solve on it though.  Is mine 
smaller than normal?  Do people trigger and stuff on these?

I&#x27;ve never sanded a cube before.  BUT, if I was to try, I would only 
take off any edges that can catch, like the mould marks.  I 
wouldn&#x27;t attempt to make any inside faces completly flat.  I say 
this because I have heard stories of corners being too loose, like 
a loose tooth.  And of course, it&#x27;s so annoying for a cube to pop 
apart, which is far more likely on a cube which is sanded down.  I 
have a really nice cube here, formerly Dan Knight&#x27;s, and I can still 
see where the mouldings are, so clearly it&#x27;s not been sanded 
very heavily.  Also, Ron, a well respected sub 20 second player, 
would never sand his cubes at all!

He works them for about 6 hours with no lube.

About sanding.
 
I used to sand, but I found that &quot;chemically sanding&quot; is better.
Use Vaseline to eat away the plastic on the edges, it works wonders.
Lubricate with Vaseline and use it for about 2 weeks constantly..
Then clean it out and lube with silicone spray (Sythetic with Teflon or
Pure silicone)

          <div class="email-content">  I am curious, but how much time did it take you to do your &quot;awful&quot; time 
with the edge-first solution on your 5X5X5?  I currently can do less than 7 
minutes with an edge-first solution.  Eventually I may have to go to a 
center-first solution to get faster.  I would have to figure out my 
center-first solution first!

          <div class="email-content">My technique is the worst :-) 
Takes me something like 15 minutes at a normal hand speed (on my Mini
5x5)
 
I do: Top Centers
Top Edges
Top corners
Side edges
Bottom edges
Centers for the other 5 sides
 
Its very repetitive, and easy to learn. Ill post the link if someone
wants it, I got it off of the rubiks website.
 
I don&#x27;t use a Meffert 5x5, I don&#x27;t have one at the moment. I sold it
because I didn&#x27;t like the tile pattern.
I will buy a new one. My mini 5x5 broke (some idiot in school broke it
and wont pay for a new one)
 
Meffert will have new stock of 5x5&#x27;s for $28 in White-Blue and
White-Yellow Ideal style colors. Each type IS limited, so order what you
need at first.

Mefferts, about 3 inches high.  Is mine normal?

          <div class="email-content">Hello, everybody interested in big cubes. <br>
<br>
I use different method. <br>
http://www.geocities.com/makimoto2000us/cindex-e.htm<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t put my 5x5x5 method yet. <br>
It&#x27;s basically as same as my 4x4x4 method. <br>
<br>
Briefly, <br>
#1 Top corners<br>
#2 middle edges<br>
#3 top inners<br>
#4 3 top edges<br>
#5 middle inners<br>
#6 final top edge<br>
#7 bottom edges<br>
<br>
#2 and #5 are the most important parts of my solution. <br>
Don&#x27;t solve inners one by one. <br>
Avoid isolated unsolved inner spot. <br>
When I have time, I would like to update this tip on my web. <br>
<br>
I am not good at virtual cubes, but I can solve real 5x5x5 within 5 <br>
min. in average. <br>
You can see my solving video. <br>
Thanks. <br>

The oddzon faces, even if you pry them opened cant be adjusted without a
machine I think. 
Oddzon is the only make in the US. In hungary, the Rubik Studio makes a
lot of them. They have faces that can open

Edge first took a really long time (well over 10 minutes, but then 
again my cube is very hard to turn - as I probably mentioned 
already all of my current cubes have occasions where they 
refuse to budge and in order to do a move I have to resort to 
turning 3 times in the other direction). It probably took 15 minutes 
or something similar. On a real cube my current method takes, 
probably 8 minutes but I haven&#x27;t timed it for ages because I am 
sick of how long it takes to twist. Given that I can solve the thing 
in 235-265 moves (quarter turns) it follows that if I could move 
even at 1 move per second on a real cube I should easily be 
able to break that time. On the java applet my only problem is if 
my mouse sticks.
On the subject of speed-cubing the 5x5x5, I set a time of 
2 minutes 37.509 seconds today.
I took quite a lot of moves (255) but was moving relatively fast.
Strangely I am in the rather bizarre position of having my 5x5x5 
personal best closer to my 4x4x4 PB than my 4x4x4 PB is to my 
3x3x3 PB.
 That&#x27;s counter-intuitive so it suggest that either my 4x4x4 PB can 
be improved or that my 5x5x5 PB is better than it should be (or 
possibly that even cubes are slightly more complicated for their 
size than odd cubes).

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Here&#x27;s a few short notes on building edges in the 5x5x5.<br>
Each edge consists of a central edge piece and two non-central <br>
edge pieces.<br>
Let&#x27;s assume that all three pieces are in the middle layers.<br>
Slicing may help you to build the edge straight away. If not, there <br>
are 2 basic scenarios: the non-central edge pieces are in the <br>
same layer (there are 2 similar cases - corresponding to which <br>
layer they are in) or the non-central edges are in different layers <br>
but when slice together with the central edge the central edge is <br>
the opposite way round. Denoting the non-central edges by X <br>
and the central edge by Y these two cases can be made to look <br>
like:<br>
<br>
X     X (the X&#x27;s may be in different faces)<br>
       Y<br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
X<br>
Y<br>
X. <br>
<br>
The centres should be correct at least to the point of horizontal <br>
stripes. So they will look a bit like<br>
<br>
TTT<br>
UUU<br>
VVV<br>
<br>
(not necessarily distinct).<br>
<br>
In the first case, use the lower slice to match the two strips <br>
labelled T and V above so the centres look like<br>
<br>
TTT<br>
UUU<br>
TTT<br>
<br>
Then you can freely rotate the single X through a half turn without <br>
affecting the X adjacent the Y and without messing up the <br>
centres or the edges in the up face and down face (although they <br>
will change position). To be effective, you should have lined up <br>
the correct X and Y at the start (so that they match).<br>
<br>
In the second case, slice the Y out (away from the Xs) rotate the <br>
face that contains it (but not the Xs) through a half turn, slice the <br>
Y back to the Xs and then rotate the face you just rotated back <br>
through a half turn (the last rotation is unnecessary if the centres <br>
look like <br>
<br>
TTT<br>
UUU<br>
TTT<br>
<br>
already.<br>
<br>
This strategy is good for the first 8 edges (which are stoed in U <br>
and D faces). After that, you&#x27;ll want to slice the centres back <br>
together before working on the last 4 edges.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone.<br>
I started cubing about 1 week ago after having a break for about 18 <br>
years or so (!). Anyway, Im now solving it consistanly around 2 min <br>
using Trajbers layermethod, when i try using the F2L method it takes <br>
about 4-5 min. <br>
My questions: Should i get better i layer method first before <br>
switching to F2L? How long did it take for you experienced guys <br>
before you made serious progress?<br>
Should I wait before learning F2L-algs and just try to solve it <br>
myself even if it takes alot of time?<br>
Thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you enjoy tinkering and want to try solving on your own, go for it. <br>
If you are looking to get faster right away, I&#x27;d say pick one of the <br>
fast systems (be that F2l, corners-first, etc) and stick with it.  It <br>
will take time (maybe a long long time) to get the hang of whatever <br>
system you choose, but even longer if you choose a slow one, and then <br>
switch later to a fast one.  I used to use a corner system, and found <br>
it tough to learn the F2l system, as I was used to looking for <br>
different pieces and had to &quot;unlearn&quot; moves.  So, if I were in your <br>
spot, I would start right off with a fast system.  You will find <br>
others disagree, so of course it&#x27;s up to you!<br>

really like to hear if anyone has found solutions better the ones I <br>
found.<br>
<br>
You can find my algs at:<br>
<br>
http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html<br>
<br>
I use cuberotations in my algs. I think it&#x27;s easier that way. <br>
Everything in parentheses is one fluent move. Try some and see if <br>
you like it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing:<br>
There used to be some people in the chatroom. Now it&#x27;s getting a bit <br>
slow. I have seen messages from people asking when there is a chat. <br>
Someone replied to that telling that every weekend (from 11.00 EST <br>
untill the last person leaves) there is one, but still they never <br>
showed up. Just try it. I did and it is nice to talk other <br>
cubefreaks. If you have a question just ask it. Some very fast people <br>
may be able to help you. Even if you don&#x27;t speedcube, just join us <br>
and say what you want to say. (You probably don&#x27;t get a chance to <br>
talk about the cube at home. At least I don&#x27;t....)<br>
<br>
I hope to talk to you soon.<br>

Only one or two minute of 60 min program. <br>

It was 21 sec still world record, but it&#x27;s not his best performance. <br>
His hands stopped a few times. <br>

Jake, even if you had to use both the orientation and permutation 
algorithms, you would still be well below 20, right? I personnaly 
disregard times when I get &quot;too&quot; lucky. This means either that the 
LL assembled by itself or I got too lucky (this is kind of loose) in 
the F2L. If I simply skip one stage, such as permutation, it is OK 
and can be counted towards PB. Otherwise, I would discard it 
as &quot;cube insufficiently scrambled&quot;. Skipping the LL permutation 
happens once in 72 attempts (skipping the orientation happens once 
in 216 but this can be increased while finishing the LL) and is not 
that lucky, in my opinion.

It is not that unusual to scramble the cube poorly when one uses 
some periodic moves or finger shortcuts for scrambling, especially 
after a long run of solving when one can get careless in scrambling.

Your 13 sec. time reminded me what happened to me on the plane last 
week. I was solving the cube in a moderate pace paying attention to 
the number of moves and my ability to &quot;see&quot; the cubies in the F2L 
rather than the speed. This is a very good warming up exercise, btw. 
An Air Force lieutanant was sitting behind me and asked a few cube-
related questions. Then he wanted to time me. I got &quot;moderately 
lucky&quot; (the permutation algorithm was just U^2) and solved the cube 
in 13 seconds ... I explained to him that I just got lucky a bit and 
had a few more attempts (18, 17, 22, 18, and 17). This was not bad 
considering that the cube was still rather stiff. I have to admit 
that I do not remember when was the last time I solved the cube in 
13 seconds in front of somebody. Those really short times usually do 
not have witnesses ... :)

Good point that. Scrambling in between can get a bit tedious and that&#x27;s why I use the scrambler from Benoit Formet&#x27;s page:

http://www-eleves.iie.cnam.fr/formet/cube/scramble.htm?nb=25

That way I force myself to scramble the cube sufficiently (and of course, it&#x27;s random).

I think a good way of memorizing is divide the algorithm 
into &quot;macros&quot; or finger shortcuts. It also helps to follow what 
happens to the first layer as you perform the algorithm. To adjust 
the algorithm for your hands, do not be afraid to do some &quot;bold&quot; 
things, such as performing the whole algorithm with a cube turned by 
180 degrees or even upside down. Sometimes you can twist the cube by 
twisting TWO layers with your right hand rather than just one - this 
basically twists the cube by 180 degress (a neat trick) without 
having the regrip the cube. I am sure you find your own tricks that 
will lead to a unique style of yours.

Overall advice, try to &quot;dissect&quot; each algorithm and look at the moves 
from different angles to figure out the best way to perform them. I 
am not a big protagonist of the idea that there is just one correct 
(or best) way to do the algorithms because we are all different and 
we develop different twisting styles. Besides, it is soooo nice to 
watch other speed cubists how they handle the cube and perform the 
algorithms with ease and speed. It never ceases to amaze me to watch 
others do their magic with the cube.

Pleasant memorizing wishes

Jessica

http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube/Net<br>
It has a decent interface (&gt;2 moves per sec possible) and there is a <br>
high score list. Krrash did a great job, and added some nifty <br>
features lately.<br>
<br>
F.i. you can now replay HOW other cubists solved the cubes. Check it <br>
out at http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube/Net/turnlists/index.cgi <br>
Thanks Krrash!<br>
<br>
We were talking about lucky cases, so here is a lucky case I had <br>
yesterday. You can replay it at:<br>
http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube/Net/turnlists/show.cgi?<br>
file=69ea8ba3e4a70e9b2a31c97858087a47<br>
After F2L the upper layer was solved! Just try it.<br>
<br>
You can also replay Dr. C&#x27;s solves of the big cubes. He is the master <br>
of big cubes and blindfold solving.<br>
<br>
For those cubists desperately looking for suitable algorithms, please <br>
check out Pejave&#x27;s site at <br>
http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/PetersCubePage.html<br>
Pejave spent hours and hours looking for the fastest triggers. Thanks <br>
Pejave!<br>
<br>
Last but not least: check out the official site of the World Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Games championship at http://www.rubikswc2003.com<br>
Our friend Gosd123 deserves appreciation for all the things he was <br>
already able to arrange. The next few weeks will be important, <br>
because some sponsors are going to decide whether they will help us.<br>
Thanks Gosd123!<br>
<br>
OK, enough talking. Hope to meet you soon in the chatroom or in real <br>
life. I will be staying in Barcelona starting June 29. So if any of <br>
you is there too, please send me a note, so that we can meet.<br>
<br>
Happy cubing!<br>

was using my 15 second pre-inspection time, the bottom edges were all <br>

went by in a flash. I know at least one Corner/edge pair was already <br>
together, but that was it. I don&#x27;t remember if the LL was in two or <br>
three looks, but it was an easy Permutation alg, just a three edges <br>
one. BUT GOD I FEEL Good... My PB just went from 26 seconds to <br>

 just out of curiosity...
how many people on this egroup actually solved the cube by themselves...i mean, without referring to online solutions? it&#x27;s perfectly understandable that some might not like to admit to this...!
any answers?

That is one basic method for layer-by-layer solving.  Once you get that you can go learn more and more algorithms, etc.  Good luck.

   ***   puts his hand up   ***

I am no where near clever enough to figure out how to solve the 
cube.  I relied on a site very similar to cubeland.fr to solve the 
cube.  In fact, I can&#x27;t put my current knowledge to good use on the 
big cubes either, I&#x27;m gonna have to read a solution to that too.

          <div class="email-content">HI

I can honestly say I have solved the cube by myself and figured out 
the way to do it.  My method consistantly takes me around 1:45.  I 
stopped cubing for a long time.  Now I am learning Jessica&#x27;s method 
and I am around 1 minute now =)  Needs to get faster, always.

the Professor.  Admitting my own solutions were not the fastest.  I borrow <br>

In general, people are in the chat room on Saturday mornings from 
about 9am pacific time until early afternoon.  Some people are also

That would be more of a conjecture than a postulate. I&#x27;d be very 
surprised if it were true. It&#x27;s certainly true that n is bounded above 
by the number of total positions and therefore the problem is 
decideable (hence you wouldn&#x27;t need a postulate) but I would 
imagine that n is less than this.

Perhaps, but not even the diameter of the group is known and 
that is an easier problem or at least as easy, I would have 
thought (if d is the diameter of the group then it is easy to see 
that d&lt;=n at any rate).

<br>
if somebody have ever try to use the program &quot;ACube solver&quot; by Josef <br>
Jelinek??  because i want to try it but i don&#x27;t understand <br>
everything !!. However I have read the file &quot;readme.txt&quot;<br>
<br>
If some people use it, can you give me a concrete exemple of using?<br>
<br>
For exemple to find algorithms to orientation and permutation N°1 <br>
according to fridrich&#x27; web site?<br>
<br>
This program is (normally) enable to ignore some part of the cube. My <br>
goal is to find algos to &quot;solve&quot; from a state1 to another state2 <br>
(state2 isn&#x27;t a solved cube) How can I do???<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance For Helps!!<br>

post it.  When solving the cube on the last layer, you sometimes end <br>
up with the edges opposite there correct color.  For instance, all <br>

edge is located on the red side, the white edge is located on the <br>

Nice page. I liked the 3x3x3 one especially (having done 2x2x2 <br>
before, although not as efficiently). Indeed, I wasn&#x27;t sure you <br>
could even get a position like that, so it was nice to see.<br>
I&#x27;m not sure what criteria you are using for 4 and 5 to be ultimate <br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, I just want to say thank you.  The move you posted for the 4

definitely one of the cases I didn&#x27;t like to see but now it&#x27;s one of 
my ok ones.  Thanks for the move, I&#x27;ll have to start practicing it 
like crazy now :)

The only thing I would suggest is from what others have 
suggested before.  Go slower on the F2L and faster on the LL.

Memorizing algs isn&#x27;t as hard as it seems.  Some things that may help:
Choose an alg that is comfortable for your hands, rather than just 
picking the first one you see (try them from different sites).  That 
is very important.  Also, at first, just try to recognize the 
patterns.  Solve the cube, and see how quickly you can recognize the 
permutation when you get to it.  When you&#x27;re trying to memorize the 
moves, write them down on a sheet of paper.  Try to memorize just the 
first 2 or 3 turns of a move (like R&#x27;UR).  Do that for all the moves. 
Then solve the cube, and see if you can remember those first several 
moves when you reach the perm stage.  Soon you&#x27;ll find you know the 
first few turns.  Then go for the next 2 or 3 turns.  Often these will 
be in the form of finger tricks (short moves you can do quickly, like 
R&#x27;UR). Keep your cheat sheet handy.  When you feel like it, you can 
work on one move over and over for 5 min or so.  Before long, you&#x27;ll 
think it&#x27;s all pretty easy.  Good luck.

It depends how fast you want to become.  15 sec for the LL is good.  
If you learn the LL in two (orientation move, then permutation move), 
you can eventually get under 10 sec for LL, even down to 6 sometimes.
It&#x27;s your call.

<br>
Yes, F2L is first two layers and LL is last layer.  I say go slower <br>
on the F2L because it allows you to see what&#x27;s happening as <br>
you do an alg, it helps you to foresee what you need to do next.  If <br>
I blaze through the algs on f2l, I finish with a slower time <br>
because there are so many gaps after algs.  The LL can be done <br>
as quick as you like I think.<br>

I don&#x27;t really think you should slow down in the f2l, but make sure 
you force yourself to look ahead and if the pieces are going too fast 
for you to keep track of then you might want to slow down just a 
little bit......and i think what some one else said about keeping a 
rhythm is important too, so pretty much whenever i cube i listen to 
music so theres a beat to follow, and you can kind of relax a little 
bit when cubing that way, its better if the music has a faster 
tempo...

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t believe that someone can average 16 seconds, corner system,

they can solve a rubik&#x27;s cube in 12 seconds! The problem is that 
they&#x27;re using their own timing method... First of all, the timer 
should start as soon as we look at the cube because thinking of the

method :
- I solve 20 cube scrambled by computer(at least 25 moves)without 
inspecting them
- I remove the highest time (possibly a pop)
- I remove the 10 lowest time
- I average the other 9 times

I know some of you won&#x27;t agree with this method but I think that it 
is a fair one. I think that a really good cubist can go near 20 
seconds but not below. 
Tell me what you think.

hey John.....whats your average???...... i used to think it was 
impossible to solve the cube in 30 seconds........now my average is 
under that.....

and dan G doesn&#x27;t use just a corners method, he uses a few different 
methods all at the same time depending on how the cube is scrambled.

Does Knights use a corner method then?  I always got the 
impression he is from the school of Jessica.  I guess I&#x27;ll look at 
his site again.

The only information I ever found about his solution was that he 
is very secretive.  I&#x27;m not sure there is any online information at 
all, but if you find some, I&#x27;d be very interested to know too.

Does anyone know the complete method?

          <div class="email-content">There seems to be way too much emphasis being put on the method or 
individual algorithms, whether they can be performed in 1.5 sec. or 
1.9 sec., and other not really essential details. Here is my personal 
observation - pick the 10 fastest people, who will all be sub-20 
consistently BTW, and I am quite sure you would find out a surprising 
variety in their systems, algorithms, finger shortcuts, cubing 
styles, cross on a side or bottom, corners first, by layers, God 
knows what else.

You can study all chess books, replay all games, memorize a huge 
amount of information, but still you may not play great chess. 
Because after all, it is the person, his ingenuity, talent, and 
physical and mental abilities, who plays the chess, not the system.

Furthermore, I do not mean this to be directed to any particular 
person, but in all sports there is certain distribution of 
performance among contestants no matter how hard we practice. We all 
have our limits in everything, different gifts, degree of 
determination and motivation. There will be those who can achieve 
with ease and those who have to work hard for their success. That&#x27;s 
life.

Good luck with the cube to everybody and turn more to yourself for 
answers because this is where the real answers are ...

Sorry for sounding like a mentor, but I just could not stand back 
anymore.

Finally, Eligeon, I encourage you to try the corners-first system. It 
is possible that the by-layer system &quot;does not fit&quot; your mind. Josef 
Jelinek&#x27;s (Gloom) site has quite a collection of useful moves for 
this system. Keep us posted on your progress.

          <div class="email-content">Heyo,  I was playing around with methods a while ago.  I have always <br>
stuck with a layer by layer concept.  Just have been making tweeks <br>
along the way.  One day i was inspired by the corners first method to <br>
try and create a wacky solution.  So far i havent heard of this on <br>
yet.  You start by doing the midle layer, then place all the corners, <br>
and then finish with the top and bottom edges.  Its kinda weird but <br>
it aint to bad.  I don&#x27;t think that i will ever convert to a corner <br>
method layer though.  I just see the layer method a lot better.<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Here&#x27;s some data for the 18x18x18 that I did last night:<br>
(of course some stages had mistakes that will adversely affect <br>
the totals but the main point is not altered)<br>
<br>
first centre 707 turns<br>
second centre 858 turns (less freedom so it should take a bit <br>
longer)<br>
third centre 844 turns (less freedom but less places to look - no <br>
need to keep opposite centre fixed also)<br>
fourth centre 840 turns<br>
fifth and sixth centres 1081 turns<br>
first 8 edges 399 turns<br>
next 3 edges 274 turns<br>
cross 9 turns<br>
F2L 31 turns<br>
fixing last edge 43 turns<br>
OLL 12 turns<br>
PLL 18 turns<br>
<br>
Net turns for each stage: centres 4330 turns<br>
Edges: 716 turns<br>
3x3x3 part: 70 turns<br>
<br>
I got a little lucky in that it was an OLL that I know so that I didn&#x27;t <br>
need two steps. Also I didn&#x27;t have to switch 2 edges but that&#x27;s a <br>
50-50 thing anyway so that&#x27;s not so lucky.<br>
Anyway, the main thing is that centres massively outweigh edges <br>
with the regular solution being least of all so my slowness at <br>
3x3x3 is really not so big an issue on big cubes.<br>
This is why I maintain that centres are the key for large cubes.<br>

          <div class="email-content">1. drunk. ONLY worked 12 hrs today.  finally time to have a beer(old <br>
E hg800 40 oz.)planned on a 9 ball pool tourney, but was stuck workin <br>
too late again.<br>
2. Cross!  switched to the bottom.  I&#x27;m horrible at it, plus I was <br>
never good when it was at the top...  I want it on the bottom b&#x27;cuz I <br>
can C where it might come in handy for starting the F2L (according to <br>
cross on bottom).  I&#x27;d like to eventually B in the low 20&#x27;s.  using <br>
the F2L from speedcubing.com which I&#x27;m just learning (I used to <br>
average 35 seconds w/ puting 1 piece in at a time) I&#x27;m getting some <br>
times in the 30&#x27;s.  However, now I take up to 10 seconds ALONE to do <br>
the cross on the bottom.  of course this will improve... but I&#x27;d love <br>
to do it as fast as U sub-20 second cubers.  so I&#x27;m wondering what is <br>
an average time for U guys on it.. and if you memorize all the moves <br>
4 it B4 you start.?<br>
<br>
3. F2L. Delayed learning matching parirs up 4-ever.(4 months)..  <br>
however recently I started learning 1 alg a day during my 15 min. <br>
breaks.  It&#x27;s been easy (and I don&#x27;t consider myself lucky according <br>
to quickness of learning). started w/ the matching pairs connected, <br>
then pairs in the U layer, next pairs wherever.  Soon E&#x27;nouf I&#x27;ll use <br>
em&#x27; all.  So I would suggest learning it if you have any such <br>
desire.  Both Ron and Jessica&#x27;s sites are a wonderful help.<br>
here&#x27;s the question... what piece... edge or middle. do you spot <br>
first and decide the next alg you&#x27;ll use. or is it either way or just <br>
different.?<br>
<br>
4.  bla bla bla.  here&#x27;s some of the email I wrote to my friends wife <br>
yesterday...--&quot;ughh.. worked from 5am to 8 pm today. basically did 1 <br>
operation all day long for parts that were due in may.  I thought too <br>

    Yea.  If you solve the cube under a minute in front of a crowd.  
People do become impressed.  Especially if its your friends.  So 
being fast is an easy way to become a little popular.

I found orange in a separate roll (the other 5 colors came in a pack) <br>
at Home Depot.  It was in the same section as the pack of 5.  It was <br>
a larger size roll than the pack rolls.  So maybe try there.<br>

There are 4 edges, each of which can have 2 possible orientations. So you can have 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 possible orientations of the edges. However, because of the mechanics of the 3x3x3 cube, you can only change the orientation of the edges in pairs. Hence you have to divide by 2 which gives 8 possible orientations of the edges.

The corners are similar: there are 4 corners, each of which can have 3 orientations, which results in 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 possible orientations of the corners. You can only change the orientation of the corners in groups of 3, so dividing by 3 results in 27 possible orientations of the corners.

Since the corners and the edges can be oriented independently, the total possible number of orientations is 27*8=216. Only one of these orientations is the correct one, hence the probability of the final layer being correctly oriented after F2L is 1/216.

The exact reason behind the fact that corners can only be twisted in groups of 3 and the edges can only be twisted in pairs can be found in group theory and algebra, but I leave that for someone else to explain :-)

As for the probability of not having to solve the final layer, I don&#x27;t know the exact calculation as yet.

I hope this makes sense to you.

the probability of the cube being solved after you do the f2l is 
1/1211, i have no idea how to get that number or anything i just know 
that thats the total possible wayz the cube can be for the LL and one 
is the solved state....

          <div class="email-content">Since 1211 can&#x27;t be divided by 2 and 3, 1/1211 is not the right 
probability. There is 1212, up to isomorphism, different cases for 
the last layer but that&#x27;s not what we are searching here.

Pick a corner and suppose it is in the good position. There&#x27;s a 
probability of 1/3 that this corner will be correctly oriented. For 
the second corner, there&#x27;s 3 possible cubes and 3 possible 
orientations, and for the 3rd one : 2 cubes and 3 possible 
orientations. Finally, the orientation of the last corner is 
determined by the orientation of the other three. Same thing with the 
edges, 4 possible edges and 2 possible orientations for the first 
edge, 3 possible edges and 2 possible orientations for the second and 
there&#x27;s 2 possibilities for the remaining 2 edges. We get : 
(1/3*1/9*1/6)*(1/8*1/6*1/2)=1/15552.

So, there&#x27;s one chance out of 15552 that the last layer will be done 
after F2L (but you may have to turn the LL slice to complete the 
cube).

In fact, it&#x27;s not 1/1211. Assuming you&#x27;re not worried about just 
twisting the last layer it is 1/15552. If you worry about that too it&#x27;s 
a bit less.
To see this orientations and permutations are independent. 
There&#x27;s 216 ways to orient. If we&#x27;re not worried about twisting the 
last layer we can assume a corner is already in position (not 
nec. oriented). Then split into cases:

all corners in position (even permutation) the edges must also 
be evenly permuted hence in a 3-cycle, a double transposition or 
solved. There are 8 3-cycles (4 ways to choose the correctly 
positioned edge and 2 ways to do each 3-cycle), 3 ways for the 
double transposition and 1 solved way. That gives 12 ways to 
permute.

no other corners in position (3 cycle) there&#x27;s 2 ways to do this - 
for each we have an even edge permutation and there&#x27;s 12 ways 
to permute the edges as above so that&#x27;s another 24 ways to 
permute.

one other corner in position (transposition) there&#x27;s 3 ways to do 
this - for each the edges must be in an odd cycle - either a 
transposition (6 ways of choosing the 2 corners) or a 4-cycle (6 
ways of setting this up - choose an edge to start and then there 
are 3!=6 ways to arrange the rest of the cycle) so that&#x27;s 12 ways 
each for a total of 36.

So then we get 72 ways of permuting with one corner in position 
and 216 ways of orienting to give a total of 15552 ways of which 
only one will be solved. So the probability is 1/15552.

If you are concerned about having to just twist the last layer the 
probability is even less.

Another way how to arrive at the results is as follows. It is not 
elegant at all, but can be read out of the algorithm pages some of 
us have (e.g., www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/orient.html).

Go through all orientation positions and count those positions that 
are symmetric about four axes as 1, those that are symmetric about 2 
axes as 2, and those that are symmetric about one axis as 4, and the 
rest, unsymmetrical positions as 8. Then add those numbers and you 
will get 216 (do not forget to include the case when the all cubies 
are correctly oriented). This is because you can flip the cubies in 
just one manner (for the 4 symmetry axes), in two manners for two 
axes (if you can twist the top layer), etc.

Similar resoning can be applied to permutations. A three cycle of 
edges can occur 8 times (four times counterclockwise and four times 
clockwise), the same for corners, etc. Again, adding those numbers 
gives you 72. 

And that 1211 number is actually not so simple to arrive at. It is 
the number of algorithms one would have to memorize (not counting 
reflections and inversions) to solve the LL in one shot. I do not 
know of any elegant way to derive it except for a computer search.

          <div class="email-content">Just for the fun of it, I decided to do a computer study of making<br>
the cross. Although I have been making great improvements over the<br>
last month or so (my average is now in the mid-30&#x27;s, whereas 6 weeks<br>
ago it was about 55s) I still seem to have problems making the cross<br>
sometimes. A lot of speedcubists say they average about 6.5-7 moves<br>
for making the cross. On a good day I can match that, but sometimes I<br>
totally mock it up and need about 6-7 seconds for completing the<br>
cross.<br>
<br>
This led to the following questions :<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the minimum number of moves in which you can always solve<br>
the cross?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the average number of moves you would need if you could<br>
always see the shortest solution?&quot;<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s why I wrote a Java-program that caculated the length of the<br>
shortest solution for all possible configurations of the edges of the<br>
first layer. The number of possibilities is 12*11*<br>
10*9*2*2*2*2=190080. I counted the following moves as 1 move: R, Ri,<br>
R2, F, Fi, F2, L, Li, L2, B, Bi, B2, U, Ui, U2, D, Di, D2. I didn&#x27;t<br>
count slice moves as 1 move.<br>
This is the result:<br>
<br>
0 moves required: 1     case  out of 190080 (0,00005%)<br>
1 moves required: 15    cases out of 190080 (0,00789%)<br>
2 moves required: 158   cases out of 190080 (0,08312%)<br>
3 moves required: 1394  cases out of 190080 (0,73338%)<br>
4 moves required: 9809  cases out of 190080 (5,16046%)<br>
5 moves required: 46381 cases out of 190080 (24,4008%)<br>
6 moves required: 97254 cases out of 190080 (51,1648%)<br>
7 moves required: 34966 cases out of 190080 (18,3954%)<br>
8 moves required: 102   cases out of 190080 (0,05366%)<br>
<br>
So the number of moves in which you can always solve the cross is 8,<br>
but 99,94% of the cases can be done in 7 moves. The weighed average<br>
is 5,812 moves, which gives the anwser to question 2.<br>
<br>
So nothing spectacular, really. I am now investigating whether<br>
counting slice moves as 1 move reduces the number of required moves,<br>
but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far it will only cut down about 1 move.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s probably a totally useless experiment for speedsolving, but I<br>
thought I would share it with you anyway.<br>

it could be worth a try.......maybe you could buy a new cube and use 
it on it, then break the cube in and see if they peel or not

yeah i could just turn the orange side into black or something, but 
orange is one of the better colors in my opinion ( because its 
brighter and sticks out better).....what i ended up doin for a 
temporary fix is just paint over the center sticker, since the center 
was the only one givin me grief thats the only one i 
painted.......still on the lookout for orange tape though.........

if anyone knows where i could pick some up i would really like to 
know, and if i must i would wonder if i could have somebody just send 
me some.  I would pay for shipping and for the tape of course.....but 
i&#x27;d say that would be my last alternative.
thanks

Well, every cubie would have its own battery, I suppose that&#x27;s the 
simple way of doing it, there would be a light for each facelet 
powered from the battery in its own cubie.  Perhaps with some 
clever fiddling, you could have one battery power all the centre 
lights, but one battery for each of the edges would be necessary 
to power two lights each, and one battery for each of the corners 
would power three lights each.

All the edges and corners are big enough in my opinion to 
contain the parts, and even make it easy to change the batteries.  
The tricky part would be to put all the parts in nicely, it would be 
like building a ship in a bottle, tricky but possible!  I&#x27;m not sure 
how the centres can be done, I&#x27;ve never looked inside them.  It 
might be easy to pull facelets off and glue them back down after, 
it&#x27;s just changing the battery that you&#x27;ve got to worry about.

Can you get LED&#x27;s in six colour options?  If you can&#x27;t then 
perhaps you could make the puzzle like the tartan cube where 
only four colours are used anyway, but it would mean four lights 
on each facelet and space gets tight.

However it&#x27;s done, it would look fantastic speed solving in 
complete darkness.  I have a glow in the dark cube, and that 
looks really cool when you do some speedy finger tricks.

On a similar subject, I was pondering on whether a cube could 
solve itself by using internal servo motors.  I suppose a custom 
giant cube would be needed.  Radio control?  Blue Tooth  : ]

          <div class="email-content">On the subject of an auto moving cube,
You would need to rig some type of radio thing up using (high torque,
preferably) servos (which cost $60 for the good ones) to operate motors
that move each face, one for each face is easiest.
It would have to be on the outside, so I don&#x27;t see that you would
necessarily need a giant cube, however it is probably easiest to work
with.
You could drill a hole through the center cap and mount the axle to the
center piece making it as simple as possible. 
I don&#x27;t know why you would want to do this, but you could.
You even (in a giant cube) could rig up a counter system - to count
movements of the faces. This was patented actually, but you could do it
yourself if you could find the parts. All you need is an lcd display (2
or 3 digits) a reset counter button (battery disconnect) a neat little
one chip cpu board, a battery and some wire 
All of it could be put into cubies (of a giant cube) and instead of wire
- re-make the central spindle out of metal to conduct electricity across
the inside of the whole puzzle!

One problem with just stickers on 5 sides is that it would allow 
for cheating in blindfold cubing. I was thinking more of no 
stickers but directly spraying the plastic.
If I spin my cube as hard as I can I can just about get 90 
degrees. Soon I will be opening my new cube though and 
hopefully it will spin better.

Why not coloured, translucent plastic - then you could get way 
with one light in each edge (instead of 2) and one in each corner 
(instead of 3)?

I hear where you&#x27;re coming from.  It would give a different effect to <br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Here&#x27;s a review of the new cube I just bought. It was a <br>
Toybroker&#x27;s cube and I got it instead of the cheaper one at The <br>
Discovery Store because it had my colour scheme on it.<br>
<br>
Initial thoughts:<br>
It seemed a bit stiff but this time I have silicone grease spray on <br>
my side so maybe that will help.<br>
<br>
Because lubricating with WD40 in the past had caused the <br>
stickers to go bad, I stuck clear nail varnish over them to protect <br>
them against the lubricant.<br>
<br>
Opening the cube. This cube is the tightest cube I have ever <br>
seen. I had to take about 4 screwdrivers to it before I could <br>
dislodge a piece (in fact, I had got to the point of putting the spray <br>
on the screwdriver and sliding that into the cube to try and <br>
spread the lubricant.<br>
<br>
After finally getting an edge out (with an enormous cracking <br>
sound), it was still very tight so that taking out a corner was still a <br>
big problem. Indeed even after that getting a second corner out <br>
was a problem. After that I gave up and just decided to spray the <br>
stuff in. Putting the edge back in was also extremely hard. It is <br>
extremely unlikely that a piece will ever accidently pop from this <br>
cube.<br>
<br>
The lubricant helped a little bit and I was able to spin the sides <br>
about 90 degrees with one twist but that&#x27;s hardly any good so I <br>
again battled a piece out and lubricated some more (and again <br>
a third time). So now I can&#x27;t quite get 180 degrees but I can get <br>
more than 90 degrees.<br>
<br>
This cube also jams a fair bit, probably because it is so tight.<br>
It is certainly the worst cube I have ever encountered for turning <br>
(and that includes my c. 20 yr old one from Denmark which is <br>
pretty bad at twisting but is neat for historical reasons).<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
Colour Scheme 5/5<br>
Twistability 2/5 (if that *)<br>
Ease of opening 0/5<br>
Twistability with lubricant 3/5 (NB If I ever se a world class cube <br>
this may fall - this is only from my experience of cubes *)<br>
<br>
So my plan now is to maybe retire this one to blindfold cubing <br>
before I even start trying speed stuff on it and go with the <br>
discovery store. Maybe I can spray paint it with the correct <br>
colours.<br>

Nice little review Dr,

I&#x27;ve never heard of Toybroker, where did you buy it?  I have 
bought the cube that Discovery so, it&#x27;s so rubbish that it&#x27;s in the 
bin now!  I&#x27;ve got a couple of the Oddzon cubes like you can get 
from Hessport, rubiks.com.  You can get them in The Gadget 
Shop, The Entertainer and Beatties.  Are you in Oxford or 
something?  I&#x27;m sure one of them stores are near you but if you 
ever go by Lakeside in Thurrock, you&#x27;ll find luck there.

Here is my review:

White on bottom, blue on top, green, red yellow and orange in 
clockwise order.  Stickers are laminated paper, opalescent in 
appearance, lasted some 6 months so far with moderate use 
most days, starting to peel a little.  It turns very rough but easy 
enough as new, finger tricks are difficult.  I opened it, easy too, 
used stiff silicone lube from a pot found in a hardware shop.  
Turns great now if a little lumpy, perhaps cos I never sanded it.

I know what you mean about your cube being difficult to open.  I 
bought some of them custom cube designs Rubenking, Glow in 
the dark etc, I decided to lube them, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever had 
to use tools to get one open and I swear I though it snapped as it 
came apart!  Took me  just as long to put the bit back in after too.

from when i read the first post what i had pictured in my mind was 
the transparent plastic approach......with a light and battery in 
each piece, and each light will have its color for the side....(white 
might be hard to do though)....and you could have some sort of 
transparent sticker that reflects the light on the cubies and makes 
them glow.............the problem running through my mind now is how 
to turn it off and on  ?!?!?!.......maybe by some type of 
remote?..................i believe there is plenty of room inside the

It can happen.  If you have ever seen a remote control car, sometimes 
they have lights.  What you need to do is buy several watch batteries 
and see if you can run them to a light.  (You would need 30 for all 
the pieces.)  Then you need to put a transmitter in each.  Then using 
the remote, turn on the same frequency channel and bingo!  You have a 
glowing clue.

  IF YOU JUST UNDERSTOOD ANY OF THAT, PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK 
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE DID!

Yes, some 20 years ish.  You can get them from mefferts.com  I 
hear that Mefferts make good ones but I&#x27;ve never tried one.  I got 
mine from rubiks.com but I&#x27;m not sure you can get them there 
anymore, mine was from a limited run.  You can of course get 
them from ebay.com.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not surprising that people might start having RSI problems if 
they are cubing (expecially speed cubing) all the time. I know that 
the cube is heaps of fun and highly addictive, but it&#x27;s not worth it 
if it&#x27;s at the expensive of your health. It&#x27;s *really* important to

          <div class="email-content">I have a car that&#x27;s some 6 months old, it&#x27;s only a modest car <br>
really, but I&#x27;ve been looking at buying a new one already (faster <br>
one).  I was talking to my Mum about it the other day and she <br>
was surprised that I would want a new car so soon.  She thinks <br>
that I just want to waste my money in an effort to bring some <br>
enjoyment back into my life!<br>
<br>
She blames the internet and especially the Rubik&#x27;s Cube!  I <br>
bought my first cube about a year ago and I got addicted <br>
immediately, I just had to learn how to solve it as quick as my <br>
little brain allowed me to do so.  A year later and it&#x27;s still a work in <br>
progress.  I play with it on a daily basis and I&#x27;m well known for <br>
doing so.<br>
<br>
She thinks I&#x27;m boring and what&#x27;s more, she thinks I&#x27;m bored of it <br>
too and that&#x27;s why I want to buy a new car!  I told her that&#x27;s BS <br>
and I still love playing with the cube.  Some people (who aren&#x27;t <br>
capable of solving a cube) just don&#x27;t understand the facination.  I <br>
like playing with the cube because it&#x27;s relaxing, it&#x27;s like a stress <br>
toy for intelligent people (blowing my own trumpet, hehe).  I&#x27;m <br>
sure that in a year, I&#x27;ll still be playing with it, still be improving, <br>
hopefully finally average below 30 secs fingers crossed!  I&#x27;m <br>
also sure that I&#x27;ll be happy with whatever car I have!<br>
<br>
Anyone else have similar stories?<br>

It still jams a bit but the cube is working a lot better today. I&#x27;ve had 
some pretty good times (for me). It&#x27;s still not the best cube I&#x27;ve 
had, but it&#x27;s much better than it was originally.

I find that often when I try to go R, I get F&#x27; instead. Is this a 
common problem and if so, is it easy to resolve?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve ran into a slight end of that story.  People ask me if i get 
bored solving the cube all the time.  Most people know me because of 
my cubing and i cant leave the house without one.  Its funny because 
for us cubers the cube is used for enjoyment, clearing our minds, and 
for stress relief.  Where for people who cant solve one finds it 
frustrating, boggled minds, and a stress causer.  I find that the 
cube is a lot like chess.  If you know how to play you can enjoy it 
without the headaches and frustation.  For us talented people we find 
relief in complicated things like chess and especially the CUBE

          <div class="email-content">I have a collection of rubiks like puzzle ranging from 70 to 80 of <br>
rubiks like puzzles.  Around 45 to 55 of em are normal 3x3x3.  I have <br>
taken many of them apart and noticed that the skeleton peice(if thats <br>
the term) (the 6 way joint) are in many different colors.  I have <br>
red, brown, yellow, white, green, pink, gray, black, purple, and <br>
clear.  Some of the previos are translucent.  But anyway, does the <br>
color mean anything?  I know there are many knock off brands, do each <br>
brands have a different color?  Is one color more rare than another?  <br>
Thanks much<br>

It is well-known (see http://web.usna.navy.mil/~wdj/RUBIKA.HTM <br>
for example) that the cube is a 2-generator group, generated by <br>
the moves<br>
<br>
x=UBLUL&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27; and y=RRFLD&#x27;R&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the usual 6 generators in terms of x and y (not the <br>
shortest possible solutions, I daresay, but rather ones I figured <br>
out using a probably inefficient method):<br>

          <div class="email-content">i think thats an easier system, to go directly to the 2x2x3 block,<br>
instead of starting with the 2x2x2. especially if you previously used the<br>
F2L system. what i usually do is place 3 edges and then place 2<br>
corresponding corner-edge pairs, which leaves you with a 2x2x3 block.<br>
once you get used to it, its pretty easy.<br>

It&#x27;s 1260. Here is the effect of one such algorithm: for the edges 
do a 7 cycle and 2 2 cycles (pemutation), flip the unmoved edge 
and one of the edges (but not both) from one of the 2 cycles and 
for the corners a 5 cycle and a 3 cycle and twist one corner from 
each cycle (opposite ways).
This move is possible (each permutation is even and the 
orientations all work out).
The edges are fixed every 7*2*2=28 moves (if you just look at 7*2 
then you find that two edges are flipped (from the 2 cycle that had 
an edge flpped)).
The corners are fixed every 5*3*3=45 moves (if you just look at 
5*3 then you find that all the corners in the 3 cycle are twisted).
28 and 45 are coprime so to fix both corners and edges 
simultaneously takes 1260 moves.

I don&#x27;t have a particularly efficient way of working out moves but 
the inefficient program I wrote gives this as a solution (it solves 
the cube from such a position so its the inverse move and hence 
also has order 1260):

DiLU^2LiDLU^2BLiF^2LBiLiF^2
UsBUiBiDsLULiU^2BLsU^2RsBU^2
LBiLF^2LiBLF^2L^2
RiBRiF^2RBiRiF^2R^2
UR^2LFiLB^2LiFLB^2Rs^2Ui
BiRBiL^2BRiBiL^2B^2
F^2U^2RiBsU^2FsRiU^2F^2
UiLUiBsL^2FsUiLiU
DiRDiBsR^2FsDiRiD
F^2DRsF^2LsDF^2
UiFsR^2BsUi
Fs^2R^2UFsR^2BsUR^2B^2F^2
F^2R^2UFsR^2BsUR^2F^2
F^2UiLsF^2RsUiF^2
R^2UFsR^2BsUR^2

I&#x27;m using i for inverse here so probably Di would be written D&#x27; on 
here.

I have just joined speedsolvingrubikscube, so hello to all cube-<br>
minded people.  <br>
<br>
By way of introduction I mostly use the F2L method and am currently <br>
leaning the 2-look ll algs (permutations done, orientations are on <br>
the way!).  I picked up a cube about a month ago for the first time <br>
in nearly 18 years.  Back then I was the fastest in my school (even <br>
though I did the ll in 4 looks), but at the moment I am not <br>
specifically going for really fast times, and instead just trying to <br>
get everything into a series of smoothly executed moves.  Once <br>
everything feels more automatic I reckon the speed will come!  So at <br>
the moment I usually solve the cube in just under a minute.  <br>
<br>
And like lots of people here, I want to get my average down to ... <br>
well ... at least 30, no, 25 seconds, ok ok under 20 and then I will <br>
be satisfied ... <br>
S.<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
To see that this is the maximum possible (that 1260 can&#x27;t be <br>
exceeded) is not too difficult either.<br>
<br>
Note that after a certain number, N,  of moves all the pieces <br>
return to their original positions (not necessarily correctly <br>
oriented). After that the cube may be solved (so the algorithm <br>
needs N twists), need corners and edges orienting (so the <br>
algorithm needs 6N twists), need only edges flipping (so it <br>
needs 2N twists) or only corners flipping (so it needs 3N twists).<br>
<br>
We can work out N from the cycle structure of the permutations:<br>
possible cycle structures for corners (and the moves to solve the <br>
permutations - the least common multiple of the length of cycles) <br>
are:<br>
(odd)<br>
8 cycle (8)<br>
6 cycle (6)<br>
4 cycle (4)<br>
2 cycle (2)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (10)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (12)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (4)<br>
3 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (6)<br>
<br>
(even)<br>
7 cycle (7)<br>
5 cycle (5)<br>
3 cycle (3)<br>
identity (1)<br>
6 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (6)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (15)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 4 cycle (4)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (8)<br>
3 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (3)<br>
3 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (12)<br>
2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (2)<br>
<br>
Except for the 8 cycle you can arrange for all of these to twist a <br>
corner in one cycle and a corner in another and the result will be <br>
that the total number of moves needed to solve the corners is <br>
multiplied by 3.<br>
<br>
Only those numbers need be considered which do not divide <br>
others in each table (because the number we are after will be <br>
the least common multiple of the number we get from the <br>
corners (possibly multiplied by 3) and that we get from the <br>
corresponding edge table (possibly multiplied by 2)).<br>
So we get (modified to take account of multiplying by 3, where <br>
appropriate) and removing repeats:<br>
<br>
(odd)<br>
8 cycle (8)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (30)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (36)<br>
<br>
<br>
(even)<br>
7 cycle (21)<br>
6 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (18)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (45)<br>
4 cycle &amp; 4 cycle (12)<br>
<br>
Now we do a similar calculation for the edges. <br>
I get something like this:<br>
<br>
(odd)<br>
8 cycle (16)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 4 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (120)<br>
9 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (36)<br>
8 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (48)<br>
7 cycle &amp; 4 cycle (56)<br>
7 cycle &amp; 3 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (84)<br>
<br>
(even)<br>
<br>
11 cycle (22)<br>
9 cycle (18)<br>
8 cycle &amp; 4 cycle (16)<br>
7 cycle &amp; 5 cycle (70)<br>
7 cycle &amp; 3 cycle (42)<br>
7 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (28)<br>
6 cycle &amp; 4 cycle (24)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 3 cycle &amp; 2 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (60)<br>
5 cycle &amp; 4 cycle &amp; 2 cycle (40)<br>
<br>
Now look at least common multiples of entries from <br>
corresponding tables and take the maximum:<br>
<br>
for algorithms where we have odd permutations the maximum is  <br>
max(lcm(8,16),lcm(8,120),lcm(8,36),lcm(8,48),lcm(8,56),<br>
lcm(8,84),(lcm(30,16),lcm(30,120),lcm(30,36),lcm(30,48),<br>
lcm(30,56),lcm(30,84),(lcm(36,16),lcm(36,120),lcm(36,36),<br>
lcm(36,48),lcm(36,56),lcm(36,84)) <br>
i.e. <br>
max(16,120,72,48,56,168,240,120,180,240,840,420,144,360,<br>
36,144,504,252)=840<br>
<br>
for algorithms where we have even permutations the maximum <br>
is <br>
max(lcm(21,22),lcm(21,18),lcm(21,16),lcm(21,70),lcm(21,42),<br>
lcm(21,28),lcm(21,24),lcm(21,60),lcm(21,40),<br>
lcm(18,22),lcm(18,18),lcm(18,16),lcm(18,70),lcm(18,42),<br>
lcm(18,28),lcm(18,24),lcm(18,60),lcm(18,40),<br>
lcm(45,22),lcm(45,18),lcm(45,16),lcm(45,70),lcm(45,42),<br>
lcm(45,28),lcm(45,24),lcm(45,60),lcm(45,40),<br>
lcm(12,22),lcm(12,18),lcm(12,16),lcm(12,70),lcm(12,42),<br>
lcm(12,28),lcm(12,24),lcm(12,60),lcm(12,40))<br>
i.e.<br>
max(462,126,336,210,42,84,168,420,840,198,18,144,630,126,<br>
252,72,180,360,990,90,720,630,630,1260,360,180,360,132,36,<br>
48,420,84,84,24,60,120)=1260.<br>
<br>
Finally max(840,1260)+1260 so that&#x27;s the number you seek.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;ll see that 990 occurs in the (even) list but isn&#x27;t quite the <br>
highest entry in the list. You have to have an 11 cycle to get the <br>
factor of 11 and that really means you can&#x27;t contribute too much <br>
from the edges (22). With 1260 you get to contribute 45 from one <br>
side and 28 from the other.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have bought cubes, and a car, but they were entirely unrelated <br>
events! Haha! But seriously, yes, cubing can be relaxing. For those <br>
who can&#x27;t do the cube it&#x27;s just frustrating, but for good cubers it&#x27;s <br>
great. By &#x27;good&#x27; I&#x27;m not just talking about the sub-30s people (I am <br>
not in that category!), but anyone who can do it in under a few <br>
minutes because considering the total population, the proportion of <br>
people who can solve a cube in under 1-2 minutes would be very very <br>
small.<br>
<br>
The other thing I&#x27;ve found is that the cube is something you never <br>
forget. I&#x27;ve been cubing on and off for a while and I have gone 2-3 <br>
years without touching a cube, but can still pick it up and solve it <br>
easily without even thinking (although it might take a little longer).<br>

Jessica,

If you, by any chance, received that yesterday, do you think it&#x27;s 
significant that it&#x27;s exactly a year after the alleged event?

According to my calculations the possibilities are:

Any factor of 112, 132, 462, 504, 840, 720, 990 or 1260 and all of 
these are achievable (so there are 72 possibilities of which 1260 
is the maximum).

The 72 possibilities in full are 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24,28,30,33,35,
36,40,42,44,45,48,55,56,60,63,66,70,72,77,80,84,90,99,105,110
,112,120,126,132,140,144,154,165,168,180,198,210,231,240,25
2,280,315,330,360,420,462,495,504,630,720,840,990,1260.

No others are possible.

If you require a position corresponding to a particular number let 
me know and I&#x27;ll post it.

Beats me - I don&#x27;t know how they came up with it. It&#x27;s of course 
clear that one generator is insufficient so 2 would be the best 
case and crazily it can be done. I figured out how to get U, D, F, B, 
R and L from the two generators but I don&#x27;t know how they got 
them originally.
I can offer some possible insight but it&#x27;s only possible in the 
sense that it&#x27;s me looking at it in hindsight knowing the 
generators they&#x27;ve got (rather than anything else).

One of the moves leaves a lot of stuff fixed (only the U layer is 
changed). It switches only two corners and 2 edges and it flips 
two edges (one of which stays in position) and twists 2 corners 
(one of which stays in position).

The other move changes a lot of stuff - it&#x27;s an 11 cycle of the 
edges and a 7 cycle of the corners. It does fix one corner and 
one edge (and even the orientation of the edge that it fixes). It 
fixes one corner orientation (but not the corner it fixes).

Obviously the stuff that one move fixes cannot also be fixed by 
the other move.

The first move (I think I called it x) is probably chosen as it has a 
lot of nice properties 2 of which are:

its 4th power just twists 3 corners and does nothing else.

its 6th power just flips 2 edges and does nothing else.

A move with such properties must satsify certain conditions:

the 2nd power can&#x27;t move any corners or edges from their 
positions (if it did then applying to the 4th power the 6th power 
would) so the permutations of edges and of corners involve only 
fixed pieces and 2 cycles.
At least one edge moves (if not then even powers wouldn&#x27;t flip 
any edges) so there is at least one edge 2 cycle and at least one 
edge 2 cycle in which an edge is flipped. If both edges in the 2 
cycle were to flip then the 2nd power would flip them twice so on 
the 6th power neither would be flipped. So some other edge 
must flip too. The simplest way to do this is to just have one 2 
cycle and flip a fixed edge and a non-moving edge.
Now the corner permutation also involves just 2 cycles and the 
4th power twists 3 corners (all the same way of course). It 
follows that if a corner in a 2 cycle is twisted it will twist either 
twice or 4 times (depending on whether both the corners in the 
cycle twist. If a corner not in a 2 cycle is twisted it will twist 4 
times (or equivalently once).
So every corner that is twisted after one application will be 
twisted after 4 applications and so exactly 3 corners must be 
twisted in the original move. (In the actual move UBLUL&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27; 
there is again 1 2 cycle for the permutation - the simplest 
possibility - and three corners are twisted; both the corners of the 
two cycle and one other - moreover, everything that changes in 
this move is changed in the U face, again this makes things 
simpler).

If the other move had long cycles then we&#x27;d be able to achieve 
quite a lot already:
Suppose we had a move with an 11 cycle of edges and the edge 
it fixed was also fixed in orientation but was the edge that the first 
move both flipped and moved.
Using such a move we could guarantee that all the edges were 
correctly oriented: thus the 6th power of the first move flips 2 
edges and one of these edges is unchanged by the 2nd move. 
Using the 2nd move a certain number of times move bad edges 
into the other of the two positions, flip the edges and then undo 
the 2nd move the same number of times. The effect will be to flip 
the bad edge and the edge fixed by the 2nd move. Do this for 
each bad edge (except possibly the fixed edge which is the only 
edge the 2nd move can&#x27;t move to the other position) and the 
edges will all be correctly oriented - including the edge fixed by 
the 2nd move, since the total number of badly oriented edges at 
any stage is even.
Similarly we can show that we can correctly orient all the corners 
(if we have a 7 cycle as described). 
We can do this at the end so it just remains to show that we can 
position the pieces correctly.
To do that note that conjugation of the form y^{7k}xy^{-7k} can be 
used to do nice things with the edges. Thus y^{7k} fixes the 
positions of the corners (if not their orientation) but since 7 and 
11 are coprime we can choose k to get edges into a position 
which x will switch. Then y^{-7k} will take the edge back. The net 
effect (ignoring orientations) will be to switch the 2 corners 
switched by x and to switch 2 edges (and we have a great deal of 
control over which edges get switched by choosing k 
appropriately). In short, we can get all the edges into position 
(we may have to do one more x, i.e. use k=0 at the end, to 
achieve this).
Then use moves of the form y^{11k}xy^{-11k} to move the corners 
into position; an even number of such moves will be required so 
the edge positions will not mess up.

So that&#x27;s the basic idea behind it, I guess.

Easier is to do nothing at all! (or R4) for instance)

Easier is R2

R is about easiest here.

Yeah, I messed up with that one. Not sure why. It can be 
achieved from a 4 and 6 cycle of edges and a 7 cycle of corners.

> 360 FU&#x27;R
> 396 UDR2EL (incorrect? is not on Richard&#x27;s list)

This is only possible because you&#x27;re using E in your list of 
generators. If you only use U, D, F, B, R and L then 396 is not 
possible (the above move does indeed take 396 sequences to 
come back to the start). It&#x27;s to do with E not fixing the position of 
the centres.
In the set of generators U, D, F, B, R and L if we are to have 
396=11*36 then there must be an 11 cycle of edges. That leaves 
a factor of 36. The edges contribute either 11 or 22 (neither of 
which is divisible by 4) so we must have that the corners are 
fixed every 36 moves. To get a from the corners requires a cycle 
of length 4 or a cycle of length 8 (but then we get a factor of 8, 
which we don&#x27;t need and can&#x27;t get the 3s either). So we must 
have a 4 cycle and since the edge permutation is even we either 
have another 4 cycle or a 2 cycle as well. This leaves no room for 
a 3 cycle so we can only pick up a factor 3 by corner orientation 
aand we can&#x27;t get a factor of 9. So 396 shouldn&#x27;t be on my list 
(although it can be on yours since you&#x27;re allowing the move E).

If you look at UDR2EL you&#x27;ll see that after 6 moves the corners 
are correctly positioned, if not correctly oriented, relative to the 
original centres which come back into position every 4 moves. 
So every 24 moves the centres are back in their positions and so 
are the corners (although they are not correctly oriented). The 
corners are correctly positioned and oriented every 18 moves so 
the corners and centres are correct every 36 moves 
(36=lcm(18,4)) and after 36 moves you can see that the edges 
are 11 cycled. So after 396 moves everything is in place. I didn&#x27;t 
check that the orientations of the edges are OK after 396 moves 
but I guess they are given that that is the given move.

This one should be easy to check. By doing RF2B&#x27;UB&#x27; I can see 
in the edges a 7 cycle and 2 2 cycles (of which in one there is 
one edge flipped and the other not) and in the corners a 5 cycle 
and a 3 cycle (containing one twisted corner) so this move does 
have order 1260.
 
On the other hand  RF2R&#x27;UB&#x27;  fixes the FR and DL edges so it 
can&#x27;t have the required cycle structure so it doesn&#x27;t have order 
1260.

Today I picked up a cheap £5 cube from the Discovery Store <br>

pretty good out of the box (it should be since it is described as <br>

some pretty good things for a raw cube. I stuck in the lubricant <br>
when I got back (didn&#x27;t varnish this time) - the cube was a lot <br>
easier to open than my Toybroker&#x27;s one, but still not the easiest <br>
and putting it back was harder yet - and it&#x27;s turning very well. I can <br>
definitely get 180 and sometimes even 270 degrees on a twist. <br>
I&#x27;ve only just put the lubricant in so I&#x27;m going to wait a bit and see <br>

Bleugh Richard,

That was the cube that I threw away eventually.  Let me tell you, I 
never throw ANYthing away!  If it&#x27;s like the one I had, it turns kinda 
nice from new, although finger tricks are difficult since the 
centres are not sprung.  The same cube?  Well, as it wears in, 
and it will quite quickly, the whole thing will loosen up and start to 
jam a lot.  It will not jam if it&#x27;s lubed though, which is what I did, 
then it turned way too easy for me, I kept pinging it out of my 
hands!  The wrong sides kept turning and I&#x27;d forget where I was 
in an alg.  If you rub the centre stickers firmly, you make out a 
hole, just off centre, this is where the centres are fixed to the 
centres by plastic rivets.

It&#x27;s still the best cube I&#x27;ve ever seen. I can get a 360 turn on it 
now.

Sorry I meant a 4 cycle and an 8 cycle of edges and a 7 cycle of

Ron, the problem is we are working in different groups. I am <br>
working in the group with 43 and a bit quintillion elements (with <br>
fixed centres) but you are working in a larger group of which 24 <br>
elements correspond to &quot;solved positions&quot;.<br>
Your group has elements S, E and M. They generate a subgroup <br>
K. The usual group G is a normal subgroup of your group (as is <br>
easy to see and I&#x27;m pretty sure that G and K intersect only in the <br>
identity (it seems clear enough anyway) so that your group is a <br>
semi-direct product of K with G.<br>
The fact that they are different groups is evidenced by the fact that <br>
your group has an element of order 336 but the usual group <br>
(centres fixed) does not.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer on the next paragraph: it&#x27;s a bit late, so this might not <br>
be completely OK.<br>
<br>
In other words, if you try to identify the &quot;solved positions&quot; by <br>
introducing appropriate relations (like U&#x27;ED etc.) then your move <br>
becomes UDR2UD&#x27;L (although I guess it should maybe be <br>
UDR2UD&#x27;B - too late too think about it now!) and should have <br>
order 99 (or something like that - againit&#x27;s a bit late).<br>

&gt; &gt; It looks like a joke to me ...<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The actual fastest time in competition was done by a man by <br>
&gt; the name <br>
&gt; &gt; of kirt smith of Pittsfield Massachusetts. It was performed on <br>
&gt; the <br>
&gt; &gt; night of 6-26-01 in Caledonia New York and the time was <br>
&gt; 16.73. <br>
&gt; &gt; Writing to you is Dr. Nailos of the United Rubik&#x27;s Association in <br>
&gt; &gt; Virginia.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you, by any chance, received that yesterday, do you think it&#x27;s <br>
&gt; significant that it&#x27;s exactly a year after the alleged event?<br>
<br>
Jessica: I can&#x27;t help but notice that the letters &quot;kirt smith&quot; <br>
anagram to &quot;mirth skit&quot;: co-incidence?.  In fact here&#x27;s another red <br>
herring: &quot;Nailos&quot; is a pretty rare name; but its anagram &quot;Alison&quot; is <br>
not.<br>
<br>
S.  <br>
<br>
You know its funny, but I&#x27;ve just realized that making anagrams of <br>
words feels a bit like permuting the ll!  The letters are all in one <br>
order, and then you re-arrange them into a different one.  Or is it <br>
just me?<br>

This is going to sound dumb but I don&#x27;t know. That is to say this 
very weekend I am going to the Isle of Man to work (!) for 3 
months and I have no idea where I&#x27;ll be living as yet.

No idea - it doesn&#x27;t say. It&#x27;s completely unmarked, but the

You have the naivety of youth. Often I can&#x27;t remember what I had 
for dinner (or even if I actually had any dinner) and I frequently 
forget things like the formula for cubic equations (in fields of 
characteristic not 2 or 3) so I keep having to derive it which is 
troublesome and I very often forget where I am when trying to 
solve the revenge blindfolded. I would think it&#x27;s extremely easy to 
forget something after 20 years. I have forgotten loads of stuff 
over 20 years.
As regards cubing I have forgotten stuff I knew last year even.

Right - I&#x27;ve got two new cubes recently so I&#x27;m going to have a 
crack at 4 cubes blindfolded some day. Also if I can get one 
sticker for the 5x5x5 (blue I think) to replace one that&#x27;s fallen off I 
may have a go at that (but revenge is still hard enough at the 
moment).

I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not at liberty to divulge that information.

Maybe it will last longer. Maybe they&#x27;ll send me back to England

          <div class="email-content">I am also sceptical of people who say &#x27;they used to be able to do the 
cube&#x27;. I would certainly believe that people might forget some 
permutations, or not be able to solve it as quickly (either because

to be or both), but completely forgetting *everything*?

I don&#x27;t remember ever permutation I&#x27;ve ever learnt, but the ones that 
are core to the way I solve the (that I learnt 15 years ago) are well 
entrenched in my brain. The permutations I&#x27;ve forgotten are just 
short cuts that would reduce my times, but do not at all affect my 
ability to actually solve the cube. Forgetting my core permutations 
would be like forgetting how to play the piano (an analogy which I 
guess is more meaningful to fellow musicians, but you get my drift) --
 I don&#x27;t remember every piece of music I ever learnt, but the core 
skills are always there.

It&#x27;s quite possible. I was about 9 or 10 when I first got a cube (on 
a ferry to England from Denmark). I solved it 6 times that same 
day [ maybe about half an hour average then :  )  ] but was not 
able to solve it for months afterwards.

Also it would be possible if you have an incomplete strategy. For 
instance if you know how to solve the cube it is easy to come up 
with a strategy that will solve the revenge sometimes but not 
others.

As for forgetting stuff, I can only remember pi to about 103 
decimal places at the moment but I used to know 830 of which 
several hundred were very well fixed in the memory so I forgot 
quite a lot there that one would imagine would be fairly easy to 
remember (compared to say cube algorithms).

I&#x27;ve no idea about music and stuff like that because I don&#x27;t listen 
to music so I can&#x27;t make any informed comment on that topic.

It sounds very believable to me. They probably just solved it a few<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I always get the &quot;I just peel the stickers off my cube&quot; line. 
And what&#x27;s worse is that they usually say it like it&#x27;s a novel and 
clever thing to do that just hadn&#x27;t occurred to me to try!! Now I 
just tell them that peeling the stickers off is sacrilege and that 
they should bring their cubes to me and I&#x27;ll solve them the proper 
way.

Actually, I&#x27;m surprised there are so few sub 20 avg people.  Seven on <br>
the records list, plus a few more I know of (forget for now others <br>
unknown who may be out there not on these lists).  Considering the <br>
comments I&#x27;ve heard from the over 20 avg crowd about how easy it is to <br>
learn algs, or how easy this or that aspect of cubing is, I would <br>
expect many more around here by now.  I know why I&#x27;m not sub 20- it&#x27;s <br>
difficult for me.  <br>

&gt; I&#x27;ll not be using them any time soon, because I used some on <br>
&gt; my favorite cubes and these stickers last forever!  They won&#x27;t <br>
&gt; need replacing for years.  So, I have 2 sets of holographic ones <br>
&gt; and two sets of plain.  Anytime you need some, let me know.  Oh, <br>
&gt; and I also have a set of plain stickers for the Revenge if you&#x27;re <br>

Take heart my friend, for it is possible, and I have seen a 
glimmer of this truth in my own solving  ; ]

I don&#x27;t use an efficient method by any description.  I form a cross, 
then place three corners, then three edges, then the last corner, 
then the last edge to complete the F2L.  Then I work on the LL 
where I orient edges, permute edges, permute corners, then 
finally orient corners.  

As you can see, this is far less efficient than using full F2L algs 
for placing corners and edges simultaneously, then OLL in one 
alg, and PLL in a second alg.  I can easily see how people can 
solve in under 20 seconds by increasing efficiency by such a 
huge amount.

My inefficient method lets me solve in an average of 45 seconds.  
My big downfall is I still don&#x27;t think fast enough to make the whole 
solution fluid.  On a good day, where I link the algs seamlessly, 
I&#x27;ll often get low 30&#x27;s with a personal best of 29 seconds (a little 
lucky perhaps).  On a bad day when I&#x27;m feeling a big run down 
and I can&#x27;t concentrate, I still get under a minute no problems.

Next on the agenda for me is to learn the F2L algs.  My only worry 
is my thinking times.  If it takes me too long to recognise the 
cases, I might as well use the one by one method.  I&#x27;m also very 
lazy, it&#x27;ll take me ages to bother learning it all.

Why do you call it the boomerang method?  Is it because no 
matter how much you try to solve it, it keeps getting scrambled 
again?  lol?

I have been cubing a little over a year now.  But I&#x27;ve not really got 
any faster for some 4 months now.  So maybe it took me 9 
months to peak.  I don&#x27;t cube as much as some do, but just 
enough to help me through the day  :]

          <div class="email-content">I just recently got finished cubing for the first time in about a <br>
week and a half.  I&#x27;ve been laying off the cube for periods of a <br>
week or so lately due to my wrist, and also just recently I started <br>
following Ron&#x27;s advice of only cubing for periods of ten minutes or <br>
so and then putting the cube down for a while.  Anyway what inspired <br>
me to write this message is I was getting a little worried that this <br>
forced time away from the cube would maybe lessen my addiction <br>
some.  This definitely is not the case.  I had a light cube craving <br>
about fifteen minutes ago, dug my cube up out of the jungle that is <br>
my room and started cubing.  Then it was like this wave of <br>
relaxation came over me.  So I cubed for about ten minutes, and it <br>
was incredibly relaxing, got some good times, got some bad times but <br>
it didn&#x27;t matter cause man it felt good to cube again.  So the <br>
phrase &quot;you know you&#x27;re a geek when&quot; popped into my head and I <br>
decided to write this post.  Ok, my moment of inspiration is drawing <br>
to a close.  Hoped you guys enjoyed this message as some sort of <br>
entertainment.  I&#x27;m still one of you, just cubing less frequently I <br>
guess.<br>

By the end of May, I was happy that I<br>
&gt;could do it in 2 1/2 minutes.  Recently, I have made even further<br>
&gt;process to where I average 1 minute and 2 seconds.  I can&#x27;t help<br>
&gt;though, but question the some things.  Is it possible for anyone to<br>
&gt;have a sub 20 time?<br>
<br>
Hey, you&#x27;ve cut 90 seconds from your time in 2 months!  Keep that up and in <br>
two months time you will be solving the cube 30 seconds before you start!  <br>
Seriously, keep it up and you are pretty likely to keep on cutting your <br>
average, at least for the  moment.<br>
<br>
I ponder this every time I solve the cube.  I<br>
&gt;know that I might reach the time under a minute, but the fact that I<br>
&gt;see mostly older people solve the cube really bugs me.  Does it take<br>
&gt;five or so years to turn a time from 2 1/2 to -20 seconds?<br>
<br>
Good question.  Hey all you sub-20 people: how long did it take to get from <br>
60 seconds down to 20 seconds??<br>
<br>
  I am 15,<br>
&gt;and I think I am the fastest cube solver in my district.<br>
<br>
I might well be fastest in my area, but probably because I am the only one <br>
who actually cubes within a 30-mile radius of where I live :(<br>
<br>
But, could<br>
&gt;someone please answer me....IS it possible for someone who is<br>
&gt;dedicated to solving the cube, able to reach a time under 20<br>
&gt;seconds?  This saddens me since I don&#x27;t know if it is.  Please,<br>
&gt;someone.......help!<br>
&gt;<br>
I reckon that not everyone could reach under 20 seconds, mostly because it <br>
seems that getting that fast is pretty hard work, and most people dont have <br>
the enthusiasm / interest to put in the time required.  But if someone is <br>
keen enough then they must have a pretty good chance, at least, I hope so.<br>

And what is this Boomerang method?  I want to know!<br>

For me low twenties and high teens came about two years after I first 
started cubing.  Sub twenty average is four years and still going.

The toy-industry here have some crazy idea that the cube is &quot;out&quot;. So 
they don´t import it anymore. Havn´t done so for some ten years now.
If your lucky one store might stock upp on some just has a gag. But 
to there astonishment they all sell with in a month! And still they 
don´t understand that they should have the cube on the shelfs has a 
standard product!!!
I looked all over Stockholm, and all I could find was a &quot;Magic cube&quot;. 
Sure it works, and I get a great work-out fighting it. But you get 
fed up quite fast.
What I´m trying to find is some Online shop that has cheap shiping.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I checked your site. And I have some tips for your design.
First of all, change the color of the text. Blue and black does look 
cool, but it´s realy hard to read. Especially when you want to sitt 
back and hold your cube. Try using white instead.
Second, has I´m a beginner in cubing I´ve been looking around ALOT on 
different sites. The ones I never look twice at are the ones that use 
the Java cube. It´s impossible for us beginners to keep upp with the 
cube that moves. So if your purpose is educationall you should use an 
other method.
Take a look at 
http://internet.oit.edu/~cardwelc/rubiks/rubiks.htm 
This method of showing the moves are the easiest I´ve found so far.
Easy to print an bring along on the bus.
Don´t get me wrong. I realy think your solution is interesting! And 
would like to check it our more. But like i wrote, it´s to hard for 
us beginners to keep up.
And don´t diss us beginners! We will overcome and excel with 
remarkable times!!! :-)

Yeah. oinkleburger.com - but maybe you should try 21x21x21 instead.

I have.  Your method looks interesting, I will give it a go this weekend.   <br>
Congratulations on the site.  I am thinking of doing something similar, <br>
although my system is not in anyway original like yours is.<br>
<br>
You asked for thoughts: here are some.  When you get time you might like to <br>
consider adding:<br>
*an overview, on one page, of your system (without algs/applets); the <br>
overview might be a good place to state what you consider to be your <br>
system&#x27;s key attractions<br>
*how many seconds does it take you to complete each stage?, and what do you <br>
consider to be an optimal breakdown to break that 20s barrier?<br>
* a print page that puts all the algs on one or twp pages.  Warning: I <br>
printed out one of your pages but the applets are not clear (at all) from my <br>
b/w laser printer.  Jessica&#x27;s b/w print page is brilliant because it means <br>
you can work from paper, which it really helpful, obviously!<br>
<br>
By the by, the colour scheme for your applets is different from my cube, not <br>
that that matters.<br>
<br>
Keep it up!<br>
S.<br>

i looked at it, and messed around there for awhile.  and the cube 
thing is a bit confusing.  maybe you could explain the steps in your 
method to us....that would help loads

          <div class="email-content">Your solution is very close to what I call the F2L &quot;hole&quot; solution. 
Many intermediate cubers (like me) are using it and I think it is a 
natural and simple way (but of course not the fastest) to complete 
the F2L without learning a lot of algorithms. The goal is to complete 
the first layer without 1 corner and use this hole (the missing 
corner) to place the four edges of the second layer, and then, put in 
place the missing corner (you can also finish with the edge). The 
only difference with your solution is the two edge spots that you 
leave empty in the first layer but I don&#x27;t know how you can exploit 
them to make your solution faster than the old &quot;hole&quot; one.

          <div class="email-content">The overview page works well for me, eligeon.  I have a much clearer picture <br>
of what your general method is.<br>
<br>
Thinking ahead ... possible breakdown for 20 secs. could be:<br>
(1): form boomerang: 3 sec<br>
(2): complete 3 corner/edge: 8 sec<br>
(3): add last corner/edge: 2 sec<br>
(4): Oll: 3 sec<br>
(5): Pll: 4 sec<br>
<br>
Thoughts:<br>
To do (1) is 3 sec prob. means visualizing and planning all the moves before <br>
starting the clock, i.e. before the end of a 15 sec inspection time.<br>
To do (3) in 2 seconds means doing edge and corner together<br>
... obviously steps 4 and 5 need to be one look each, so a 2-look ll <br>
solution.<br>
<br>
The key challenge would be getting step (2) down to eight sec., and I reckon <br>
that where things will start to merge into one will I think begin straight <br>
away with step 1, becuase here you are placing a corner, but not an edge, <br>
and one way to reduce time is to put the corner and edge in together.  And <br>
you need to know all those algs for step 3 anyway.  But once you start doing <br>
that the boomerang won&#x27;t be appearing!<br>
<br>
The way I see it, your method is a good intermediate method that can produce <br>
pretty quick times, and can be adapted later on, if need be, to a system <br>
that is faster but needs more algs.  It is a sort of combination of the F2l <br>
&quot;empty slot&quot; method and the first stages of the Petrus method, and like you <br>
say, for some this will feel more natural than other ways. You say that the <br>
site is still in progress, so thanks for putting it on preview.  Looking <br>
forward to any updates, as well as your faster times  :)<br>
<br>
cool!<br>

          <div class="email-content">   I use the Jessica (Fridrich) method.  Although I haven&#x27;t learned 
all of the Orientations of the last layer yet, so I sometimes have to 
use three looks for the last layer.  I don&#x27;t remember everything that 
happened during the solution, but this is the scrambling algorithm 
that I used:   B U2 B&#x27; D2 F2 U F2 U R B L B2 R U&#x27; F U&#x27; F2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; 
L2 F L U2.  Solved in 19.64 seconds and was not a lucky time. I had 
to perform every step of the solution.  This was the sixth time out 
of twelve.  Even with the 19 it was still one of the worst averages 
that I had in a while (30.18).  All I can tell you is keep practicing 
and learning algorithms and the speed will come.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone!!! <br>
<br>
It&#x27;s certainly been quite a while since I&#x27;ve come to the weekend <br>
chat, or posted anything here, but I have not given up the cube!  As <br>
a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve done more things with the cube than before, <br>
and am striving for a world-record, that&#x27;s right, a world-record!  <br>
But not in the way of beating the 22.95 second time, (although I, and <br>
many others can) but rather, I am going to post the fastest time for <br>
solving a rubiks cube while riding a unicycle!  I have posted times <br>
in the 30&#x27;s while riding, with my best being 38.  I will submit to <br>
guinness when I break 30 seconds for the first time on my unicycle, <br>
though it is exceedingly difficult while keeping your balance.  At <br>
any rate, just thought I&#x27;d give you a progress report.  I&#x27;ve been <br>
unbelievably busy lately, it&#x27;s been quite a summer. I had an <br>
interesting cube event recently actually.  A few friends of the <br>
family and relatives came over for a big party, and they all wanted <br>
to see me do the cube.  Everyone gathered around, and it was for sure <br>
more than 30 people in total watching, at least 5 of them had a <br>
stopwatch to make sure.  My dad made a big deal out of it, boasting <br>
that I could beat the record and all, and had them all scramble my <br>
cube, after which he had them time me exactly 15 seconds inspection. <br>
Of course I couldn&#x27;t help but thinking how much this resembled the <br>
actual championship.  But here&#x27;s the strange part:  I felt absolutely <br>
NO pressure whatsoever.  For the first time I can remember performing <br>
the cube for people, I was COMPLETELY calm.  I still can&#x27;t account <br>
for it, maybe it was just the fun of the party that loosened me up. <br>
At any rate, I solved it 3 times consecutively in 20, 20, and 21 <br>
seconds!  All three times below the wr.   It was very strange, but <br>
certainly happy!  I also came away with over 25 dollars from the <br>
crowd, after saying to them &quot;Ya know, folks, world records don&#x27;t come <br>
cheap!&quot;, and jokingly passing around a jar.  I never actually <br>
expected them to fill it! :D  <br>
<br>
If I could just get back to that feeling, I know I can get some <br>
really good times no matter who I&#x27;m solving for.  If anyone has any <br>
similar stories, let me know! <br>
<br>
By the way, nice to see all the beginners getting better too since my <br>
hiatus.  Keep on cubing all!  And I&#x27;ll be back in the chat this <br>
weekend for sure.<br>

Yeah, what I meant was, once I have gotten down to the 20&#x27;s or so for 
an average on the uni, I will contact them, and hopefully they will 
come see to verify.  Otherwise I&#x27;d just tell them I did it and be in 
there already! ;)  I hope they&#x27;ll accept it as a record, too.  If 
jump roping on a unicycle is a record, this should seem to be 
reasonable as well.

i&#x27;ve been wantin to try cubing underwater for awhile.......i should 
be able to do it, but i havn&#x27;t ever tired.  I dont wanna mess up my

HI and welcome to yahoo (i agree yahoo sucks) lol.....

1st off, loose cubes are good for speedcubing,(it makes finger tricks 
LOTS easier to do, and the sides just turn alot smoother and 
all).....as for the stickers starting to look crappy... my advice is 
to go out and buy some kind of colored tape, then cutting the tape so 
its the right size for the cube....sometimes its hard to find all 6 
colors though, i think its almost impossible to find the color 
orange............i have never got a 3x3x3 cube from rubiks.com but 
they&#x27;re made by oddozon and i usually get my cubes @ walmart and im 
pretty sure its the same type of cube.....and mine is working really 
well....

from Rubiks.com.  (also one from DanG off eBay, but that doesn&#x27;t count).
They were all manufactured by Oddzon but the one from Rubiks.com was
terrible.  It would hardly turn.  I pulled it apart and the plastic had
lots of flash from the molding process.  Even after trimming the flash
and lubing it up, it still was terrible (and it&#x27;s too light to be a good
doorstop!).  I may have gotten a bad apple but I&#x27;m now reluctant to buy
without seeing first.
 
Also, the middle white stickers do have the logo but there is three sets
per order.. So, sacrifice one outside sticker from the third set to
replace the middle sticker.

          <div class="email-content">ok heres the deal....i did a couple averages the other night, using <br>
rons timer....so i could look up and see how long my f2l took me <br>
while cubing and i wouldn&#x27;t have to stop(so i could get my splits for <br>
f2l and LL)......well for my f2l on both averages there was only a <br>
1.4 second difference in the averages...( 19.7 and 18.3).....amd well <br>
i guess for my LL there was only a .9 second difference in the <br>
averages (10.9 and 11.8)...<br>
<br>
then one other thing i did was figure up my averages for the ones <br>
that i did for 2 look LL VS 3 look LL....and in the first set of <br>
averages it was a pretty logical amoung...2 look avg. was 9.5 and 3 <br>
look avg was 12.........<br>
<br>
the part thats weird is in the second average i did......my average <br>
for the 3 look was 11.12 and my average for the 2 look was <br>
12.75....to me that doesn&#x27;t seem right.......<br>
<br>
the only thing i can think of that made my 2 look take me longer <br>
would be that the algs are newer to me and i have to take longer to <br>
recognize which alg to use, what the moves are, and the alg is a bit <br>
slower because ive used it less...but that doesn&#x27;t account for my <br>
first average where my slowest 2 look was 11 seconds........<br>
<br>
what do you guys think about that??????????????(this is mainly why i <br>
made the post..i wanna hear what u got to say about this)<br>
<br>
by the way... the first average was 31.2 +.5 so...31.7....and the 2nd <br>
one was 29.6 + .5 so....30.1.....<br>
<br>
i really need to go over a few of those orient. algs so i can use the <br>
2 look more often...and get it down better!....<br>
<br>
sorry for the long post, i was just stareing at my averages and was <br>
bored lol....<br>

You should also try alternative ways of performing the algorithms. For example: some situations are symmetric, so you can mirror the algorithm and this may suit your hands better. Some of the more difficult algorithms can become really easy of you just experiment various ways of doing them.

          <div class="email-content">
thanks for the advice lars......

acutally i was to the point where i had ALL the algs learned except 
2, and i had about 3 or 4 algs that i knew but wasn&#x27;t ready for 
speedcubing........but for the next 2 weeks or so i never really had 
any time to go over my other algs or anything....so i pretty much 
totally forgot the 4 that i just barely had a handle on....and then 
even some of my algs that i had know for some time were torn from my 
memory.....kinda sucks...lol.......with a little work this weekend i 
sould be able to get the algs that i have already learned , learned 
again........and then my average will go back down to where it should 
be..

really i think one of the reasons why my 3 look was faster is because 
i didn&#x27;t have to stop and think about the alg at all...i just saw the 
first look and didnt even wanna try to do the 2 look on it and i just 
flew through it...........but it is a little aggrevating when you 
can&#x27;t remember some alg&#x27;s that you used to use in speedcubing and 
were fast at!.....:|.....i guess i know what im doin this 
weekend...lol

          <div class="email-content">I think that everyone who has switched from the 3 look to the 2 look <br>
has had this problem.   You know why it happens.   Picture this:  <br>
with your practiced 3 look system, you need only look for the alg <br>
that you know, then perform.   This alone can take some time.  This <br>
is the same for the 2 look.   But you are hurting yourself IN <br>
ADDITION to figuring out which alg.  Before you can move on the LL, <br>
you have to first figure out whether or not you can solve it in 2, <br>
then go about finding which move.  You have an added step which will <br>
slow you down dramatically.   I believe that you would actually be <br>
slower for many cases knowing half the orientations then only the 3 <br>
look method, because at least you would omit the first step that you <br>
must think through now.  There is no way around this but, you guessed <br>
it, learning all the orientations so the 2 look method becomes your <br>
default.  Once learned, you will no longer worry whether or not you <br>
can solve in 2 looks, and this will drop key seconds from your time.  <br>
Just learn them all at first, so you will not forget.   As for speed, <br>
here&#x27;s what I did to improve my LL *drastically*.   Print out an alg <br>
sheet for permutations and orientations.  Go through EACH case one by <br>
one, and record your average of 4 for that particular case.  Once <br>
they are all recorded, it is easy to go through them, and find your <br>
problem areas.  Circle all the ones that you feel are slow, and focus <br>
on them one by one until you have gotten faster at it.   For <br>
starters, see if you can get all orientations down to a 3 second <br>
average, and all permutations down to a 4 second average.  This will <br>
force you to find fingertricks, and concentrate on speed.  Once you <br>
have done that, improve all orientations to near 2 seconds, and all <br>
perms to near 3 seconds.   With sufficient practice and hand <br>
training, you can go to a 7-8 or so second average for the LL.   <br>
<br>
<br>
So, just learn them all, and be done with it! Don&#x27;t wait any longer!  <br>
You can drop to the twenties without even touching your F2L!  Now <br>
THAT&#x27;S a scary thought...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
I will be on a holiday for the next three weeks, so it may take some <br>
time before the records are updated.<br>
<br>
&gt; So, what with so many members of this club solving in under 20 <br>
&gt; seconds, is it easy for you to do 3 cubes a minute?<br>
Nice idea!<br>
My best cubing averages today are mid to high 17 seconds, so I would <br>
expect times of 51 to 60 seconds for 3 cubes.<br>
I tried it a few times:<br>
- scrambling 3 cubes (my favorite cube; my previous cube, still <br>
reasonably good; my antepenultimate cube, now a bit too loose)<br>
- a total of 15 seconds preinspection (about 5 seconds per cube).<br>
- 2 cubes on the table, 1 in the hand<br>
<br>
My times were: 59, 56, 58, 57, 55 seconds.<br>
<br>
So yes, all times below 1 minute, but a clearly higher average per <br>
cube than normal. The main differences, I think, are:<br>
- Not all cubes start in your hand (two on the table).<br>
- More lock-ups, because you tend to rush more than normal.<br>
- Your fingers get tired along the way.<br>
- You have to watch your breathing.<br>
- It is hard to stay concentrated.<br>
<br>
Btw. it is possible to look ahead to the next cube, when doing the <br>
permutation algorithm for the current cube.<br>
<br>
I will practice this some more, and see if I can get better times.<br>
<br>
Have fun, keep on cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Initially it was the challenge of solving something that seemed so
difficult.  I had never seen anyone, in person, solve the cube.  So now
it is the satisfaction and pride of being able to do something better

Subject: [Speed Solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube] Question!
 
Good Day!,

Today I was interviewed by a reporter for 2 magazines discussing the 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube and the upcoming World championships.

There was a question he asked that I could not answer with just one 
explaination and I would like to run the question by each of you to 
get your personal responses...

The Question was:

&quot;What draws people into solving the cube and why do they get 
obsessed with it&quot;????

I gave him about 5 reasons........What would your answer be??

          <div class="email-content">You bought up an interesting point about 0^0.  When a quantity is undefined, 
as it is here, we can make it anything that we want it to be!  0^0 can be 1 
or it can be 0 or it can be any number.  It has been a while since I took 
real analysis in graduate school but one thing that I do remember is that in 
the case of a functional discontinuity, that value is often determined by 
the limit of the particuliar &quot;path&quot; that we take to that point. Often there 
were cases of right-side and left-side limits (like in the real/imaginary 
plane).

Anyway, another similiar example is the value of 0/0.  Note that this is 
undefined and it can be any value we want to be.  Consider that if we write 
0/0 = y then we have 0 = 0*y.  y can be any number for it to be true.  We 
would not have differential calculus if 0/0 was not undefined!

Going back to the claim that 0^0 = 1, they are correct since it is 
undefined.  But they would be incorrect to assert that 0^0 can ONLY be 1!

No, that&#x27;s not the case.
(0,0) is not in the domain of the function (x,y)|->x^y.
If you contruct a function by adjoining a triple ((0,0),c) to this 
function, you don&#x27;t have the power function anymore.
No value of c will give an analytic continuation. Some functions can 
be so continued - e.g. (sin z)/z can be analytically continued to C 
because it has a removable singularity at z=0 (and you would define a 
function equal to 1 at z=0 and (sin z)/z elsewhere and the result 
would be analytic).
Of course, you could adjoing a triple to the power function as above 
but then it wouldn&#x27;t be a power function since it would violate the 
conditions you want a power function to satisfy.

That doesn&#x27;t sound like a graduate course to me but anyway the point 
is that if you are able to extend a definition you want to be able to 
do so without losing the majority of the properties of the function.
The standard definitions of some functions like the gamma function or 
Riemann zeta function for instance are only valid in a right half-
plane but they can be analytically continued to meromorphic functions 
on C whilst retaining most of their properties.

Again that&#x27;s untrue. Since it is undefined it can&#x27;t be any value, 
whatever we might want it to be.

>Consider that if we write 
> 0/0 = y then we have 0 = 0*y.  y can be any number for it to be 
true.  

You&#x27;d also have 0=0*x*y and then would need to conclude 0/0=x*y if 
division by 0 were allowed. You simply can&#x27;t just say that a function 
can take any value we please at a point where it is not defined. If 
you do extend it&#x27;s domain then you will likely lose certain 
properties (as demonstrated above for &quot;0/0&quot;).

>We 
> would not have differential calculus if 0/0 was not undefined!

Well, if we could define 0/0 then it would be very easy to calculate 
derivatives.
They just wouldn&#x27;t have much use. : )

No, that&#x27;s not the case. They&#x27;d be correct in saying that you can 
extend to get a similar function with 0^0=1 but that&#x27;s not quite the 
same thing. To use your line of reasoning above, in terms of 
calculus, we&#x27;d be in bad shape if we defined 0^0=1.

>From the pure mathematics point of view you can&#x27;t reasonably assign 
any value to 0^0 (which is different from saying that you can 
reasonably assign any value as long as it doesn&#x27;t matter which).
In certain systems (such as the class of ordinals) it is possible but 
then you don&#x27;t mess up continuity and so forth.

Good question - I might make the trip (if funds allow) in that case. 
Also some clarification on the blindfold contest might be useful. (Is 
the time to memorize or to solve the main thing, for instance, or the 
sum of the two.)

I think DanG would advise that these questions are posted on the official 
website.  But I would also be interested in the answers, so if someone knows, 
Dan?  Can you post here too?  After all, it might attract more attention to the 
event.

          <div class="email-content">Has anybody heard of any updates on the championships? Ever since the 
site was put up a few months ago I&#x27;ve heard nothing (although I guess 
there really isn&#x27;t anything to update).

What do you guys think of the following competition to be added to the 
event? 

TRUE BLINDFOLD

I would stick different materials onto a cube in place of the colors. 
For example, taped sandpaper for one color, bandaids for another 
color, etc., etc. You know the rest. We are all blindfolded, THEN we 
will be allowed inspection time for 60 seconds.

This was something my friend and I did a lot of in school during 
class. The teacher would be teaching something boring and we would be 
playing with our cubes inside the desk.

          <div class="email-content">My understanding is that the blindfold event at the championships 
allows you to look at the cube before blindfolding yourself. My idea 
is a &quot;braille&quot; cube where you don&#x27;t have sight of the cube at anytime.

In that case, I&#x27;ll probably skip because my best part is the 
memorization bit and I figure out the solution whilst blindfolded.
Unless of course there&#x27;s a Revenge blindfolded contest - I might have 
a shot at that.

          <div class="email-content">Since learning the F2L algs, and ll perm. algs a couple of months ago (ll <br>
orientation still not learnt, so I always do the ll in 3 looks) I have not <br>
been really focussing on speed, but just trying to get things working <br>
smoothly, without a pause.  Anyway, last night I thought I would time myself <br>
to see how I was getting on.  I did not want to do it at some extra-fast <br>
super-frenetic rate, but just stay relaxed and calm.  With an inspection <br>
time of 15 seconds my average was around the 45 second mark, but I did make <br>
quite a few in the low 30s, and one time of 28 seconds!  It was not lucky at <br>
all, and it is my first time under 30 seconds!  The funny thing was, it did <br>
not feel much different from 45 seconds, so when I put the cube down and <br>
checked the time I got a real surprise.<br>
<br>
Well, I just felt like telling everyone that I have (only once I know) <br>
broken that half minute barrier!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
Two weeks and finaly solve the cube without help!<br>
Please understand that it does not meen two weeks of continual <br>
cubing! Have to work and watch TV as well.<br>
I took the cube with me on a vacation to Greece and took the time to <br>
practice on the plane.<br>
I have two questions:<br>
<br>
1.  Does anyone have some tips how I should scramble the cube? This <br>
is extremly booring! And it seems that I always end up with the cube <br>
simularly scramled everytime. The last layer looks the same almost <br>
everytime.<br>
<br>
2.  I´m not using any special system yet. So my times are pretty high <br>
compared to you guys! :-(<br>
Now I pop one into place at the time. Can someone guide me to a <br>
system that is good to start with if I want to learn how to pop more <br>
into place at once?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advace!<br>
/Dani<br>
&quot;May the cube be with you... always!&quot;<br>

I didn&#x27;t realize there was a point. What was it? To say that a 
function that is undefined can have any value is meaningless. Perhaps 
you could elaborate?

<br>
Firstly, in my experience, even if a cube is carelessly scrambled <br>
it&#x27;s probably enough for most people.  See the thing is, you are <br>
kinda scrambling the last layer as you solve the F2L anyway.  If <br>
you think that you keep coming across the same cases in the LL, <br>
then I guess you are causing that by solving the F2L the same <br>
way from the same original scrambled case.  Get me?   If you <br>
think the the LL is easy everytime, and you are recognising the <br>
case very quickly, it probably means that you are just very good!<br>
<br>
You only need to turn a cube a little over 20 times to ensure a <br>
completely random case, assuming that you do random turns.  I <br>
scramble my cube by practicing several finger tricks and algs, <br>
and I alter the sides on which I begin each alg.  I must turn my <br>
cube at lease 60 times for each scrambling.  I have heard the <br>
pro&#x27;s (Jessica and Lars) comment that lazy scrambling is a <br>
problem for them, especially on long practice sessions, but for <br>
the most of us, it shouldn&#x27;t pose too much of a problem.<br>
<br>
My advice for learning more in depth systems for moving more <br>
than on piece at a time?  Look in the links section and keep <br>
surfing until you find a good place that makes sence to you!<br>
<br>
Lastly, how was Greece?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Expierenced speed-cubists use a lot of fingertricks, called triggers or macros. With some practice, they enable you to perform sequences of 3 or more moves at very fast speeds. For a good explanation and demonstration I recommend Dan Knight&#x27;s page:

http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints

He shows how to perform one of the permutation algorithms with triggers (with video!) and also some frequently used move sequences. Once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll soon develop your own finger-tricks. It does require a good cube though. Triggers are very hard to execute on a stiff cube so you might need to lube it (although I haven&#x27;t lubed my cubed for a month now). On a loose cube you might get a lot of piece pops which is also very annoying.

I also used to have problems completing the cross efficiently and to some extent I still have. I now practice planning the whole solution of the cross in advance before starting (like if you would solve the cube blindly) and try to improve the time it takes to see the solution. I&#x27;m trying to work my way down to less then 15 seconds.

And it certainly doesn&#x27;t take years to get fast. About 10 weeks ago I averaged 55 seconds. I bought a new cube and started using triggers and I learned the 2-look final layer method (I just finished doing that this week). Every week I was dropping seconds and now I&#x27;m averaging in the high twenties and I&#x27;m still improving (my single-PB is 21.08). You can track my progress over the last weeks at the Sunday Contest page (my name is Lars Vandenbergh):

http://www-eleves.iie.cnam.fr/formet/contest/

So just keep practicing and check out the great sites on speedcubing and your times will drop for sure!

Ahhhh yes, the 30 second barrier......keep on cubing and you&#x27;ll

IF you cannot move the cube fast enough it could be that the cube 
needs lubed a lil bit....silicone lubricant spray seems to work the 
best, just pop out a edge piece and spray a little bit inside then 
put the piece back in and scramble the cube for a couple of mins(to 
get the silicone spread throughout the inside of the cube)...let dry 
and you have an awesome cube........

as for making the cross faster you need to be able to look ahead 
enough to see all the moves you will need to make the cross before 
you start, so you don&#x27;t have to waste time looking for your next 
move....and having a lubed cube will make you a little faster also....

in the f2l you just have to force yourself to look ahead for the next 
piece you need and be able to follow its movements while doing the 
previous alg....another thing that helps in the f2l is to get in a 
rythm and try to have NO stops in the f2l....if that means you have 
to slow down some so you can keep a good 1 or 2 moves a second...or 
even 1 move every 3 seconds......but then start speeding up a little 
every time...and that should help with the f2l...

the lube they sell is wax based and does not work nearly as <br>

caused me some wrist pain.<br>
<br>
Anyway, they have since changed their formula and they have <br>
sent me a free sample!  cool!   It&#x27;s in the same easy to apply <br>
syringe as before but now it&#x27;s silicone based.  I&#x27;ve not tried it yet <br>
but I&#x27;ll let everyone know what it&#x27;s like as soon as I have some <br>

          <div class="email-content">As part of her sub-20 solution, Jessica allows 2 seconds to form a cross <br>
before going on to the next step.  I find this is quite a challenge, partly <br>
because it requires a certain awareness of all 6 faces of the cube at once, <br>
but mostly because 2 seconds goes by pretty fast.<br>
<br>
Lars V. posted an email about the cross a few weeks ago with some statistics <br>
that I found really useful.  He worked out that, from a scrambled cube, <br>
percentages for forming a cross on a pre-selected face are:<br>
4 moves or less: 0.059%<br>
5 moves or less: 30.38%<br>
6 moves or less: 81.55%<br>
7 moves or less: 99.94%<br>
8 moves or less: 100%<br>
The general principle is pretty obvious: you should expect to form a cross <br>
in 6 moves; sometimes it will take one move less and, a bit less often, one <br>
move more.<br>
<br>
Now, moves for forming the cross are of two types: (1) a move that actually <br>
puts an edge onto the correct face in the correct spot, and (2) a <br>
preparation move that makes it possible to do move (1).  Bearing in mind <br>
those minimum number of moves, forming a cross will normally require four <br>
(sometimes three) of those type (1) moves, which leaves you with about only <br>
three moves of type (2).<br>
<br>
There seem to be two tricky things about all of this:<br>
Firstly, if you want to get the minimum number of moves you often need to <br>
combine things, so that a type (1) move for one edge is, at the same time, a <br>
type (2) move for another edge.   Doing this takes a bit of lateral <br>
thinking, well, it does for me :-)<br>
Also, to do 6/7 moves in 2 seconds means using finger tricks, just the same <br>
as the algs that are needed for the rest of the solution.  I can practice <br>
the algs for the later stages because they are the same each time, but the <br>
6/7 move sequence for the cross is always slightly different, and to exploit <br>
really fast finger tricks might mean having to move the cube around in my <br>
hands, which makes planning the ideal sequence in my head in 15 seconds <br>
pretty difficult.  The thing is at the moment, even if I give myself an <br>
unlimited inspection time, so I have a sequence in my head all worked out, <br>
it usually takes me longer than 2 seconds to execute it.<br>
<br>
So ... I find it hard!  At present it usually takes me 6 or 7 seconds to do <br>
the cross.<br>
<br>
These are my suggestions / ideas for getting the average time down to 2 <br>
seconds, sort of ordered from &quot;beginner&quot; to &quot;advanced&quot;; some I&#x27;ve done, and <br>
others I&#x27;m working on<br>
*  don&#x27;t align the cross with the correct centre colours until all four <br>
edges are in place<br>
*  avoid forming a cross in more than 8 (but practically speaking, 7) moves<br>
*  practise doing the cross &quot;blindfolded&quot; after a 15-second inspection time. <br>
  (At the moment the full 15 seconds are essential for me, but I have read <br>
that in this time the pros can also plan subsequent moves, but that&#x27;s way <br>
down the road for me, if ever!)<br>
* continue extending your repertoire of finger tricks so that you don&#x27;t need <br>
to move the cube around so much (a tip that applies to all the steps of any <br>
solution, really)<br>
* I suppose if you were able to start from any face it would be possible to <br>
choose a starting colour that was good for doing the cross quickly, but I <br>
always start with white, because if I don&#x27;t everything else takes that much <br>
longer to do<br>
* ?? other tips would be great!<br>
<br>
I have sometimes wondered if starting with a cross is just not for me, and <br>
have experimented with starting with three edges instead of four, then doing <br>
the corners/edges for those, ending with a 2x2x3 block, then adding the <br>
fourth edge, and then filling in the last two corners/edges.  I tried this <br>
out (plus going from 2x2x2 to 2x2x3) for a while but it didn&#x27;t make much <br>
difference really, so for the moment I&#x27;m sticking with the cross.  I think <br>
part of the reason why I am is because I find that working out how to do the <br>
cross in your head, and then doing it as quickly as possible, is excellent <br>
fun.<br>

I was the one who did that experiment. While I was reading one of your earlier posts I was wondering just the same. I can run the search algorithm again and let it print out the cases with a minimum of 8 moves required. I&#x27;ll publish them as soon as they are available

have you ever tried Rons cube timer?.... 
http://www.speedcubing.com/games/OnlineTimer2.html

it has a count down timer, so you can say set it to 15 and when you 
start the timer thats when your inspection time starts and when it 
hits 0 it will start the timer and then to stop it you simply hit any 
key on the keyboard (hit any key to start the count down too).....

its a kewl timer, i use it when im cubing and im on the 
computer.....I like it alot better than a wrist stopwatch....

yeah i sometimes use a watch like that, it works...but Ron&#x27;s timer is

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eivind, 

You are right. I am not a real programmer. 
So you or other computer peoples can do it. 

My final goal is to have such program on PDA. 
(I don&#x27;t have PDA yet!)

I only know visual basic a little bit,
 and I thought Excel macro might be compatible for any OS on PDA.  

I asked about this thing previously, but nobody responded. 
So I decided to make this by myself with my poor knowledge of 
computer programming. 

You are the first guy who responds to me! 
Could you please make such program on PDA?

          <div class="email-content">I would use it.  So far I think that it works pretty well.  The only 
thing that I would change would be to merge the inspection timer and 
the solving timer so that they&#x27;re more like Ron&#x27;s timer.  I like to 
inspect and then go right into solving.

          <div class="email-content">Well then I guess I could just go on with it. Sorry but I can only make 
programs for stationary computers and laptops (i.e. PCs), not PDAs or Macs 
or anything other than IBM compatibles. It&#x27;s sad but it&#x27;s true :(.

Sure I can merge the timers.

          <div class="email-content">As we discussed earlier, there are exactly 102 configurations in which you need at least 8 moves to form the cross on the face of a preselected color.

This file contains the alogrithms you need to perform in order to get from a solved situation (which means cross on the U face) to the unsolved situation.

I hope you&#x27;ll find it usefull.

It is good to be looking at the problem with a fresh perspective, but 
I can think of a couple of problems of not doing the cross first.

First of all, it would take more moves to place the first layer edge 
pieces without disturbing an already solved f2l.

Second of all, you would need to learn a new set of moves for solving 
second layer edges with their corners when the edges were misplaced 
in the first layer.

If you can come up with solutions for these problems, it would be 
interesting to look at.

Not only is it possible to solve under 20 seconds, it&#x27;s possible to 
do just about every single time you try.   As for the age thing?  
That is not a factor.  I JUST turned 16, and I average 20.9 seconds 
at the moment to solve.  You can do it, and what&#x27;s more, you can do 
it in under a year if you have dedication.  Learn a good solution, 
and it&#x27;s no problem at all, just never stop practicing!  You will no 
doubt break the minute mark soon, and that&#x27;s the first step.  Keep at 
it!

minute 20 average with a layer by layer piece by piece (i.e. less effective)

All I can say is I&#x27;m glad that they only come up 0.04% of the time!  I <br>
reckon the list could be used to make some useful / fun puzzles that someone <br>
could do to get better times for making the cross.  Once I have done them I <br>

  I have a few questions that I&#x27;d like some responses to. (I&#x27;ve never <br>
actually had the opportunity to interact with another cuber which I <br>
think would be invaluable.)<br>
<br>
1) Is the Petrus method able to get you below 20? Or is it easier for <br>
me to relearn the cube using the layer-by-layer method, Jiri-<br>
Friedrich-style?<br>
<br>
2) If Petrus is sufficient, please give me some strategies to speed <br>
myself up. Should I learn how to start on any corner? Should I <br>
memorize the edge-twisting algs? What?!<br>
<br>
3) I&#x27;ve started learning the layer-by-layer to see if it&#x27;s faster. So <br>
far I feel like a complete idiot... is this normal?! I&#x27;ve gotten <br>
pretty fast at getting the cross, but past that I&#x27;m always hunting <br>
and pecking at my algorithms sheet. I know I need to memorize at <br>
least 50 algorithms, but I&#x27;m not very good at that kind of thing. Any <br>
suggestions on memorization?<br>
<br>
   Basically, I need someone to tell me &quot;Hey Donnie, I suck at <br>
memorizing. It took me months to memorize enough algorithms to bring <br>
down my time. But it will work!&quot;, etc... I&#x27;m not a brainiac!! Do I <br>
need to be to get to 20 (or at least averaging at 30)? Any <br>
suggestions on the layer-by-layer would be SO SO APPRECIATED. Only <br>
average people that are good at cubing need respond :).<br>

<br>
congrats on gettin thus far without any help....(from any <br>
conversation with another cuber)....<br>
<br>
well heres my advice....practice, practice, practice........and then <br>
practice till your blue in the face :)...lol........<br>
<br>
other than that maybe you could try something different.....which <br>
probably means your going to have to learn some more of those pesky <br>
last layer alg&#x27;s.....<br>
<br>
i have my own method workin for me...its sorta a hybrid of lars and <br>
fridrich....i do the 2x2x2 corner....expand to 2x2x3, then whats <br>
different is i do the next corner-edge pair, then the last edge for <br>
the one color, then place the final corner-edge pair and the F2L is <br>
complete....then i do the last layer in 3 looks...(slowly but surely <br>
workin on 2 looks).......i have an average of 28.8 and a best of 20 <br>
without luck using that....<br>
<br>
if you think its worth a shot give it a try...<br>
<br>
what you need to practice is looking ahead in the F2L, and being able <br>
to plan the whole 2x2x2 corner before you move anything....and its <br>
nice to beable to make the corner in 2 seconds.......and then for the <br>
LL, you need to have good algs with finger tricks to get it done <br>
quickly......<br>
<br>
just my 2 cents....<br>

          <div class="email-content">Back in high school chemistry, we learned Avogadro&#x27;s number which is the 
number of atoms in a mole of a substance.  The atomic weight is the weight 
in grams of one mole of a substance.  The atomic number of carbon is 12 
grams.  Avogadro&#x27;s number is 6.02*10^23.  This means that 12 grams of carbon 
has 6.02*10^23 atoms.  The total number of combinations of the Rubik&#x27;s cube 
is about 4.3*10^19, though very large is smaller than 6.02*10^23 by several 
magnitudes!

We can say that about 1.14 milligram of carbon has as many atoms as the 
total number of combinations of the 3X3X3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube!  So that factoid 
which you were questioning is ludicrous!!

          <div class="email-content">I use the Petrus method and I get below 20 about 1 in 10 times. So it
is clearly possible. And I&#x27;m not that great at memorizing.

The Friedrich method is used by most sub 20 people, so you have to
say it is the most proven speed cubing method. I believe that someone
more talented, younger and dedicated than me should be able to get
down to sub 20 averages with my method. Then again, I&#x27;m perhaps not
the most objective judge of that.

I&#x27;ve never done it, but I suspect it is VERY hard to switch method
after you&#x27;ve gotten so trained on one that you do it in 45 seconds.

If I haven&#x27;t completely misunderstood it, the Friedrich method is
not a layer by layer method, in the sense that you complete layer 1
before you start layer 2. You build the F2L as one cross + four
edge/corner pairs.

I agree with Heath. The key to getting faster is endless practice.
But not just mindless speedsolving (even if that is important). Try
solving slowly, getting the absolute minimum number of moves. Try to
think of different ways of doing things. Memorize final layer
positions. Visit Tibetan lamas.

Yes, you should learn to start with every corner. One fun practice I
do sometimes is to study each of the 8 corners, think hard about a
good way to do 2x2x2 for each, and pick the one with the least number
of moves. It can take several minutes, but you learn a lot. If you
solve with a 15 second preinspection, you should have the full 2x2x2
plan ready. It&#x27;s usually 5-7 moves.

          <div class="email-content">Practcing should come in 2 parts to maximize speed.<br>
<br>
Part the first:<br>
<br>
Memorize algorithms.  This is especially crucial for the *many* <br>
algorithms in the complete Fridrich method.  My advice would be to <br>
print out all the algs on a sheet, cross off ones you don&#x27;t like if <br>
there are more than one per case, then begin memorizing them in <br>
convenience groups.  This is all for the last layer of the Fridrich <br>
method only.  You should start by learning the 3-look last layer <br>
method, which can enable times in the 30&#x27;s quite easily.   As for the <br>
first 2 layers, don&#x27;t merely try to memorize them.  Look at each <br>
algorithm as you perform it.  Soon, you will begin to see what each <br>
move does, and you will no longer be merely *memorizing* anything, <br>
but rather, I think you can understand each and every algorithm for <br>
the first 2 layers.   To learn any given algorithm, perform it OVER <br>
and OVER again, each time looking for finger tricks, not just trying <br>
to get through the move.  Finger tricks help you memorize much <br>
faster.  Perform algs again and again, until it is engrained in your <br>
memory. <br>
<br>
Part the second:<br>
<br>
NEVER, I repeat, NEVER let go of a cube or alg sheet.  During the <br>
learning phase, it&#x27;s really crucial that you never take a break.  <br>
Breaks do NOT help when you are learning.  They make you forget.  Try <br>
to dedicate one hour per day to learning.  I set a goal to learn.  If <br>
you can learn 4 algorithms per day, it will all be done in less than <br>
a month.  Which is not bad at all.  Keep at it, until you know every <br>
situation!<br>
<br>
This is all of course, assuming you wish to change systems.  I&#x27;m sure <br>
with about, say 6 more months of dedicated practice, you can be in <br>
the 30&#x27;s with consistency using your method.  I will say this, <br>
however: there is MUCH more support and documentation for the <br>
fridrich method, than for any other method that I know if.  This <br>
makes it very friendly, and much more likely that someone within this <br>
group can answer your questions.  As for progress, I can solve in <br>
20.9 seconds, in about one year exactly since I started learning.  It <br>
took about 8-9 months to get into the 20&#x27;s I think.<br>
<br>
My advice?  Go for it.  Why not?  Just print them out, and go do it!  <br>
Don&#x27;t waste time, start practicing/learning right away!<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>

Cool link!

OK, lets assume that there are 1e79 atoms in the universe.  How 
big would a cube have to be to surpass that number?

          <div class="email-content">On the rubiks forum there is a formula for calculating the number of

4x4x4 cube: 7.4x10^45
5x5x5 cube: 1.7x10^82

All this maths is extreemly interesting but I&#x27;m still having a hard 
time with the reality of it all.

As I look at my 3xCube, I can&#x27;t imagine that there are more 
permutations to it than there are atoms that form it!

I look out of the window and I think about all the atoms there are 
in a brick, and all the bricks that were needed to build this city, 
and all the cities around the world.  And all that doesn&#x27;t come 
close the the atoms that are needed to form a super cluster of 
galaxies.

Perhaps I&#x27;m over looking a fundamental issue with the theory 
behind all this, but I imagine that if you calculated the 
permutations of all the cubes in the world together, it wouldn&#x27;t be 
a patch on the number of atoms in the whole universe.

Perhaps someone can understand how I&#x27;m getting mixed up 
and point me in the right direction?

          <div class="email-content">The Fridrich method might feel demanding at first, but the sequences for <br>
placing the corner/edge slots after the cross are all very intuitive, so <br>
pretty soon you do not do them from memory, but by &quot;what needs doing&quot;: I <br>
hope that makes some sense.<br>
<br>
So it is only the algorithms for the ll that need memorizing, but then you <br>
would have learnt a lot of these already with the Petrus method, especially <br>
if you were combining steps 5 to 7 of his solution into two looks instead of <br>
three.  You only new ones will be the orientation algorithims that flip the <br>
edge cubies (32 algorithms in all).  But if you start with a 3-look last <br>
layer you only need to learn three algorithms, which doesn&#x27;t sound too bad!<br>
<br>
A point in favour of the Petrus method is this: once you have solved the <br>
2x2x3 block you can pretty well see all the cubies that still need work in <br>
one glance, without rotating the cube around.  With the Fridrich method you <br>
will sometimes not get to this stage until you have slotted in 3 corner/edge <br>
cubies in the F2L.  This means that while you are solving the F2L you need <br>
to keep your wits about you, so that you can find matching corners/edges <br>
without taking too much time.  I find this pretty hard, but at least it has <br>
nothing to do with memorization :D  ... but it has got a lot to do with <br>
practise!<br>
<br>
There are quite a few good sites for finger-tricks etc., all linked from the <br>
usual main cube-sites.  But the following page can be easily overlooked (the <br>
site is not but this page in it is):<br>
http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/.<br>
&gt;From here you can get all the algs for slotting matching corners/edges in <br>
the F2L when one or both of them are not on the top layer.  They are very <br>
intuitive (so no more memorization) and you might find them useful.<br>

OK, some of my classic logic and rationale has been going mad 
on a note pad this afternoon...

If everytime you found a new combination on your cube, you 
wrote a &quot;1&quot; on a piece of paper to mark that combination.  Once 
you found 8 new combinations you would have written 
&quot;11111111&quot;.  You could also call this a byte.  See where I&#x27;m 
coming from?  After many lifetimes, you would have written more 
than 43 quinillion &quot;1&#x27;s&quot; on your very large pad.  This could also be 
expressed as 5.4065 quintillion bytes?

Now here&#x27;s where my maths might let me down.

5.4065 quintillion bytes = 5.4065 quadrillion kilo bytes?
5.4065 quadrillion kilo bytes = 5.4065 trillion mega bytes?
5.4065 trillion mega bytes = 5.4065 billion giga bytes?
5.4065 billion giga bytes = 5.4065 million tera bytes?
5.4065 million tera bytes = 5.4065 thousand peta bytes?

To be honest, I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m going with this.  Perhaps 
now I have to figure out if all the computers in all the world could 
combine together and hold such a massive chunk of 
information.  And since it is essentially atoms that would hold 
that information, then it was a ludicrous claim to make in the first 
place!

OK, Apple have recently released a 1U server unit that can hold 
half a terabyte each on four 120GB disks.  That would mean that 
more than 10 million servers would be necesary to hold that 
chunk of data?  (all of which is ones).

I think I&#x27;m geting closer but I&#x27;m also getting a headache and I&#x27;m 
wondering if I have way too much spare time today!

Can anyone tell me if I messed up my maths?

If you want I can give you the exact figure. For now, I&#x27;ll just 
mention it is roughly 1.5715*10^116.

It&#x27;s not too hard to show that it is true with a little bit of 
combinatorics if you can solve big cubes.

For N=20, the number is about 1.3366*10^1477. : )

   New question! I know that Oddzon cubes are apparently the best you <br>
can purchase, at least in America. I bought my first cube at Toys R&#x27; <br>
Us, and after lubing and replacing the stickers, it seems to be a <br>
pretty fast and forgiving cube even after several months of use (I do <br>
maintenance on this thing more than my car). Is the Toys R Us cube an <br>
Oddzon? I&#x27;ve looked on the packaging and there&#x27;s no mention of that <br>

that great? If so, why?? Thanks a lot!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s about how much of the puzzle is changed in any way by 
one single move. If I had some odd move on the cube that would change only 
two pieces (i.e. not an algorithm but just one turn of one side) it would be 
a lot more easier to solve if I hadn&#x27;t read about it in advance and such. 
Sliding tile puzzle in itself is rather easy since you only move one tile in 
a time and your ability to configure the moves to get what you want is much 
larger than in a cube.

Another thing to think about is that on a 5x5x5 cube f.ex. one turn of one 
side scrambles a less percentage than an equal turn on a 3x3x3 cube. But 
that doesn&#x27;t mean the 5x5x5 is easier, it&#x27;s just &quot;not particularily harder&quot;.

and I wondered if it was actually true, specifically the part about 
the length of time it takes to solve the puzzle (assuming a constant 
rate of twist). The answer was depends on your strategy for solving 
the puzzle. Us humans like to use intelligence and generally solve by 
achieving a series of subgoals that eventually leads to the/a 
solution being reached. A lot of us use such a solution on a 3x3x3 
cube called the Jessica method which requires &lt;60 face turns to solve 
the cube.
An interesting diametrically opposed method would be to do work out a 
sequence of moves that takes a cube through every possible state. 
This would involve a lot of moves, but at some point (in the very 
distant future!) the cube would be solved. Here you are blindly 
following a predetermined sequence of moves (which works on any 
random cube, just the number of moves from that sequence that you 
need to apply will be different) instead of applying a sequence of 
operators based on the specifics of the cube at the time you choose 
the operator.

So, in this scenario the 5x5x5 does indeed take a lot longer than the 
3x3x3. Anybody agree? Any flaws?

Well, I guess I agree in the same sense that you could get the 
complete works of Shakespeare many times faster if you added a few 
more monkeys with typewriters.

But I was referring to efficient solutions, not random ones.

Have you considered taking logs? Maybe then there would be a closer 
connection.
Of course, if we measure the difficulty of a cube by the number of 
quarter turns that is sufficient to restore any cube to one of the 
solved positions (in general, we tend to identify 2 positions if they 
look the same and we treat them as the same position although they 
may be different in the big scheme of things (i.e. if we label the 
centre pieces)) then this number is only known for the 1x1x1 cube 
(where it is 0) and the 2x2x2 cube (where, I think, it is 14).
Anyway, that number might increase a bit like the log of the number 
of permutations although in my opinion it is more likely to be O(n^2) 
where n is the side-length.
Certainly it must be bounded by Cn^2 for some C, although I suppose 
it could be o(n^2) - but I do not believe that this is true.

I imagine that a sliding block puzzle would also be O(n^2) in 
difficulty.

The reasons here are that there are similarities in the puzzles. 
Essentially each is 2 dimensional (you don&#x27;t have to solve an entire 
cube only the surface and the surface has a number of squares that is 
related to the square of the side-length.

I guess it is possible to calculate the exact size of the number of <br>
positions in a sliding block puzzle of side-length n.<br>
Assuming that we consider only the case where the hole is in the <br>
lower-right corner then the answer is (n^2-1)!/2 as I recall (this <br>
for n&gt;1 - if n=1 then the answer is 1).<br>
That&#x27;s because basically you can get any even permutation of the <br>
numbers so the size of the puzzle is that of the alternating group<br>
A_{n^2-1} (for n&gt;1).<br>
If you allow the hole to be anywhere then you&#x27;ll be able to get n^2<br>
(n^2-1)!/2 positions for n&gt;1 and still 1 position for n=1.<br>
(To see that note that you can always move the hole to the lower <br>
right position, permute down there and move it back and conversely so <br>
you&#x27;ll get as many positions for the hole in any place as in any <br>
other.)<br>
(Whether the permutation is even or not in the case of the moved hole <br>
will depend on certain factors - one can say that for any given <br>
position of the hole all permutations of the numbers will be in the <br>
same coset of the alternating group but the coset may change <br>
depending on the position of the hole (and hence implicitly the side-<br>
length of the puzzle).)<br>

At least it is a finite game though. Infinite games (and especially 
games of uncountable length) take much longer to get through. : )

No doubt! F2L&#x27;s regardless of your method is the most intuitive and 
most challenging. The LL is also challenging, but not in the 
intuitive sense, merely in patience and diligence regarding 
memorization of tens of algorithms. (IF you use layer by layer 
method. I sponsor Petrus because the memorization of the Sune alone 
eliminates the need for 20 algs. But I&#x27;m trying layer by layer to 
give it a chance.)

Well, I&#x27;m still here.
Can&#x27;t do the cube quite as well on this machine though but my 
blindfold cubing is coming along quite well. I solved the Revenge 
blindfolded 4 times in 7 attempts (including twice in a row) so 
that&#x27;s OK.
It&#x27;s pretty long hours. I calculate that by c. 13th May 2008 I will 
have done the equivalent of a 40 hour week since 1st September 2000 
and hence in some sense worked off the time I was unemployed - that&#x27;s 
assuming I&#x27;m still here then.
I&#x27;d sooner do 9-5 for half the pay but having been out of work for so 
long I&#x27;m hardly in a position to complain.

Not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to get the holiday time or not. Also I don&#x27;t 
know that I&#x27;d do OK in the WC. Apparently the blindfold stuff is for 
speed in solving (where I am better in the speed in memorizing 
position) although maybe I can try practising multiple cubes again 
(haven&#x27;t done that for a while) or Revenge - if they have that as a 
competition.
Also for some reason the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 will apparently only be 
allowed for real cubes and not virtual ones. I can&#x27;t see why that 
should be the case unless they don&#x27;t want sub 3 minute times on the 
5x5x5.

My method is described on my blindfold cubing pages which are 
currently hosted by Jessica Fridrich. The easiest way to get there is 
via www.speedcubing.com and then follow the &quot;Interesting links&quot;. 
There&#x27;s 2 choices of pages of links after that - the first will link 
you to Jessica&#x27;s pages and thence to mine and the other has a direct 
link to my pages.

My method requires you to have a decent memory and the ability to 
change stuff in your memory fairly often and keep things accurate. It 
doesn&#x27;t require much preparation. It&#x27;s possible to study the cube for 
less than 2 minutes and then solve it blindfolded.
In my method you don&#x27;t work out the entire solution in advance (in 
fact, you really don&#x27;t work out any of it, or at the most very 
little) so you have to do that when the blindfold is on - which is 
one reason why it takes a bit longer perhaps.

I disagree with a poster who recently posted about receiving the cube 
blindfolded but having faces of different textures. In some sense 
that could be described as true blindfold cubing but I think that the 
other way is better - after putting on the blindfold you have to be 
fully aware of where everything is. It&#x27;s more of a sensory 
deprivation this way.

I actually think that wearing gloves might also make it more of a 
challenge. That way you can be sure that possible imperfections in 
the stickers would not give anything away.

Of course, one could compromise like this.

Be blindfolded and given a cube as described by the poster I refer to 
above (sorry, but I can&#x27;t remember who it was). Then after one is 
done memorizing, take the cube away and give them a normal untextured 
cube which has been mixed up the same (giving it to them the same way 
up of course!) and then get them to solve it.

That way you never see the cube but neither do you feel the textures 
after you are done memorizing.

Solving the cube blindfolded is really not very difficult. It 
requires a lot of concentration and focus but probably less memory 
than learning all the LL algorithms (something I still haven&#x27;t done!).

I&#x27;m pretty sure now that solutions can easily be traced that by next 
year faster people will have broken most if not all of my UWR times.
Maybe if I get a load of time one weekend and am really bored I will 
have a shot at that 31x31x31 cube record. I think 2 months should be 
beatable. : )

Didn&#x27;t work for me - but then again I didn&#x27;t sit down and learn the 
algorithms. Couldn&#x27;t think of a good way to do that.

          <div class="email-content">During F2L, is it possible to switch the position of two middle slice <br>
edges with one algorithm? I encountered a situation where the F2L was <br>
completed, apart from 2 middle slice edges (diagonally opposite each <br>
other), were switched so that they were in the wrong positions. Is <br>
this solvable in one short algorithm? And if so, would it depend on <br>
the flip of each edge? ie, are there four such algs for the four <br>
possible combinations of flips. It is only out of interest that I <br>
ask :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was wondering if anyone had any comments/advice about switching <br>
methods once one method is so deeply imbedded that you could do it in <br>
your sleep?<br>
<br>
I have been doing the cube on and off for about 15 years and I&#x27;ve <br>
basically been using the same method the whole time. My times are <br>
around the 1 minute mark (45s-50s on a good/lucky day; 75s-90s on a <br>
bad day). Until I joined this group I hadn&#x27;t realised that 1 minute <br>
is actually pretty slow, so I hadn&#x27;t really felt the need to change <br>
my method.<br>
<br>
&gt;From reading the postings and looking at various websites I&#x27;ve <br>
concluded that my method is inefficient. It almost always takes over <br>
100 turns to solve - often up to 120 turns!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been having trouble learning another method and I think it&#x27;s <br>
because my method has been so deeply entrenched in my head for so <br>
long. I don&#x27;t remember finding it particularly difficult 15 years ago <br>
when I first started cubing??<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m guessing the answer is just practise, practise, practise, but I <br>
thought I&#x27;d ask in case other people have had similar experiences.<br>

<br>
It depends how determined you are to get faster.  If you are, then I <br>
say switch methods!  I used two other methods years ago, then didn&#x27;t <br>
cube for years, picked it up, and the algs were still in my head.  <br>
When I went to learn a new method, it was hard!  But, if you just <br>
totally forget about your old method, and say to yourself that you are <br>
going to learn a new one, you can do it!  Of course, you must be at <br>
least slightly obsessed in order to become fast.  Anyhow, for anyone <br>
mired in a slow method, or using 3, 4 look LL, and who wants to get <br>
super fast, switch your ways and/or learn all the algs.  If your goal <br>
is not to become super fast (say, under 30 at least), then other ways <br>
are fine.  Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have mentioned in a previous method that i had to alter my solution <br>
5 times in 1 year.  It is very hard to switch solutions because once <br>
you stick with a solution it becomes second nature.  That was the <br>
hard barrier that needed to be crossed.  On my first transition i <br>
spent hours just sitting and turning my cube slowly so i can <br>
concentrate on learning a newer process.  It was a tough battle <br>
because i was solving non stop with an old method, when switching <br>
over i couldn&#x27;t think straight, made stupid mistakes at school, and <br>
suffered a lapse of memory for about a week,  but its all good.  My <br>
first switch was the hardest. Now its much easier to change.  Yes you <br>
must practise practise practise, but be sure you practise slow so you <br>
are catching every move.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I was wondering how fast people are, in terms of turns/second?<br>
<br>
I timed myself yesterday (using the online timer on <br>
www.speedcubing.com) with a few sequences to get a rough idea how <br>
much time I was losing by having to have too many looks when doing a <br>
complete solution.<br>
<br>
I was averaging around 2.25 turns/second. If my solution takes about <br>
100-120 turns (let&#x27;s say 110 avg) then theoretically it should take <br>
me 110/2.25 = ~49s + &#x27;looks&#x27; time. The fact that the fastest times I <br>
got yesterday were about 65 seconds suggests to me that I am wasting <br>
far too much time with looks (in addition to the fact that a solution <br>
which takes oover 100 turns is inefficient!!). Hmmm.<br>

If Lars himself doesn&#x27;t get to you first:

   In step 4, try doing what he suggests and keep your &quot;non-turning&quot; 
hand tight on the 2x2x3 block you&#x27;ve created (Thumb on the green 
layer, fingertips on the blue). This allows you to only move R and U 
layers, making it impossible to screw up your good edges. As for 
completing step 4, what I like to do, and I don&#x27;t recommend this to 
anyone going for few moves, is get the Blue-White and Orange-White 
edge pieces up on the white layer immediately. This way I can keep 
track of where they are as I look for and/or manipulate the Blue-
Orange-White corner. Once the &quot;2nd 2x2x3&quot; is completed I go for the 
Green-White-Orange bit. Instead of trying to describe the algorithm I 
use, I suggest looking through Lars&#x27;s examples of that last corner 
area and picking one that looks like it has an easy starting 
position. I used one algorithm every single time and was making 40 
seconds or so (I shouldn&#x27;t talk like I&#x27;ve improved--I&#x27;m still at 40, 
but I&#x27;m trying to learn more alg&#x27;s to cut the time. I&#x27;m beginning the 
Friedrich, however, and am about halfway through the F2L alg&#x27;s. Man 
this is tough... I think I&#x27;ll send a message asking for hints and 
help later). So I don&#x27;t know if this helps, nor do I know if you were 
asking for, or needed help... but I like actually being able to 
contribute on this board and not just beg for scraps like a good 
Omega cuber.

Cool, how did you calculate that? Or did you have too much time on 
your hands and made 105 R&#x27;UL&#x27;U moves? ;) I suspect the former :)

I didn&#x27;t have enough time to do 105 moves but I did have enough time 
to do 7 which saved me some hassle from only doing 1.
Doing the move once you can see that, disregarding orientation, the 
cycle structure of the edge permutation is a couple of 5 cycles and 
2 fixed points and of the corner permutation it is a 7 cycle and a 
fixed point.
Thus, doing the move 5 times induces the identity permutation on the 
corners and we can note that no edges are flipped (it would be 
possible to work that out at the outset but it was quicker just to 
do it 5 times). Doing it another twice (a total of 7 times) induces 
the identity permutation on the vertices and we can note that some 
corners are twisted so that it takes 21 times to get the corners 
solved. Then 105=lcm(5,21) is the order of the move.

Well, in England we&#x27;d generally call it the order of an element and 
in the US they call it period.
It&#x27;s the least positive n such that (the move under consideration)^n 
is the identity.
So the order/period of R is 4, for instance.
You want the corresponding number for R&#x27;UL&#x27;U.

You can compute this in two stages - this may get a bit complicated, 
unfortunately.
The set of moves of the cube that don&#x27;t permute anything but only 
twist corners or flip edges is a subgroup N of the Rubik&#x27;s cube 
group G.
In fact it&#x27;s even a normal subgroup so we can find the quotient 
group G/N=H.
It&#x27;s easy to see how many times you need to perform the move to get 
into N (that is to get to the identity in the quotient group).
To calculate that you just look at the disjoint cycle structure of 
the edge and corner permutations and take the lcm of their orders.
For instance, in the case of R&#x27;UL&#x27;U the edge permutation looks like 
(a b c d e)(f g h i j)(k)(l) with suitable edges in place of the 
letters a-l. The lcm (lowest common multiple) of 5, 5, 1 and 1 is 5.
The corner permutation looks like (A B C D E F G)(H) with suitable 
corners in place of A-H and the lcm of 7,1 is 7.
The lcm of 5,7 is 35. Thus it takes 35 iterations to get into N.
Now once you&#x27;re in N your order is either 1, 2, 3 or 6 (according as 
you are solved, have edges to flip, have corners to twist or have 
edges to flip and corners to twist).
In the case in point we first get into N after 35 iterations and the 
edges don&#x27;t need flipping but the corners do need twisting, so we 
need to do the 35 iterations another twice yielding 105 iterations 
in total.
(We should take care to note that we could already be solved as soon 
as we get to N. One can observe in our case that after 5 iterations 
the edges are solved so they are still after 35 iterations but after 
7 iterations some corners need twisting. Take any corner that needs 
twisting and say it needs twisting k times (so k is 1 or k is 2). 
After 35 iterations it will need twisting 5k or 10k times but we 
only need to work modulo 3 so that is 2k or k times (i.e. 2 or 1 
times if k=1 or 1 or 2 times if k=2). Anyway, the corner will still 
need to be twisted so 35 iterations are insufficient and so 105 is 
the answer.)

If the order of a sequence is large (or it is a long sequence) it 
may be worth spending the effort of figuring it out after once move 
rather than by the above technique where I did the move 7 times.

I think last time I posted I missed one 336 as the other possibility.

> So what is the theory for calculating the periodicity of any

Well, it&#x27;s possible to do it just by looking at the resulting 
position from 1 move but I did the move 7 times to save me some 
work. : )
Calculate how many moves it takes to restore the edges and corners 
to their original positions (disregarding orientation). This will 
put you in a normal subgroup and the position (i.e. a move that gets 
you to that position) has order 1, 2, 3 or 6.
You can calculate the number of moves by taking the lcm of the 
number of moves to permute the corners, k,  and the number of moves 
to permute the edges, l.
If like me, you are too lazy to work it out by doing the move once 
then it is easy to do it in max(l,k) moves, which in this case is 7.
Suppose k&lt;=l (the other case is similar).
First do the sequence k times and note if the corners need twisting.
Then do the move a further l-k times and note if the edges need 
flipping.
Now if neither twisting nor flipping was required the number of 
moves you need is lcm(l,k).
Otherwise it is a little more complicated.
Suppose we needed only to twist corners but not to flip. If l/k (as 
a fraction in lowest terms) has numerator divisible by 3 (so that a 
higher power of 3 occurs as a factor of l than does in k) then you 
still get lcm(l,k) but otherwise you get 3 lcm(l,k).
If we only have edges to flip then if a higher power of 2 occurs as 
a factor of  k than does in l then you get lcm(l,k) but otherwise 
you get 2 lcm(l,k).
If you need to twist corners and to flip edges then you combine the 
above methods and get either lcm(l,k), 2 lcm(l,k), 3lcm(l,k) or 6 lcm
(l,k).
In the case of R&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27; we only had corners to twist. Now 5/7 is in 
lowest terms and 3 does not divide 5 so the order is 3*5*7=105.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the tip but I was actually talking about something 
slightly different.

By &#x27;good edges&#x27; I was talking about the &#x27;good edges&#x27; on the two 
messed sides (ie. the sides not part of the 2x2x3). Lars used the 
term &#x27;good edges&#x27; on his site in step 4 as meaning the edges on the 
non-2x2x3 sides which when spun around match the edge to their 
appropriate center piece (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here Lars!)

I haven&#x27;t had trouble keeping the 2x2x3 intact, that part is easy. 
It&#x27;s just that sometimes when I&#x27;m expanding the 2x2x3 to the 2x3x3, I 
end up messing these &#x27;good edges&#x27; so that I&#x27;m not left with the cross 
on the bottom once the 2x3x3 is completed. I need more practice!!

          <div class="email-content">At 40s, you&#x27;re doing better than me!! Even on a really good day I 
have rarely gotten lower than 50s.

Was the Petrus method the first one you learnt? If not, what were 
your times like before that? Now that your learning the Friedrich 
method, have you found this easier or more difficult to learn?

I had a quick look at a few methods when decidingd which one to 
tackle next. The Petrus and Friedrich methods seemed to be the two 
most popular so I had a more thorough look at them. The Petrus method 
seemed less dissimilar to what I already knew so decided to start 
with that one.

I reckon loose enough to do finger tricks (something I&#x27;m still 
working on!) but not so loose that that it regularly explodes when 
you speedcube. It can be a fine line between to the two states!

   I think there must have been a misunderstanding somewhere along 
the line here... I know exactly what you meant by &quot;good edges.&quot; What 
I was saying was once you&#x27;ve made the &quot;bad edges good edges&quot; (through 
much scolding and discipline) it is IMPOSSIBLE to make them bad edges 
again IF you hold onto that 2x2x3 block with all your life throughout 
the entire process. The procedure I described afterward was merely a 
suggestion on how to easily and consistantly finish the two layers 
with just R and U turns -- it had nothing to do with the good or bad 
edges in other words. Am I making sense? Or did I misunderstand again?

I hear the...peel the stickers off one, do you got a life, ur a <br>

me&quot;...lol.....<br>
<br>
I had one person ask me if there were pieces that were colored that <br>
you couldn&#x27;t see, then when you turn it they come out and other ones <br>
go inside....<br>
<br>
Alot of people say they&#x27;ll solve it, then act like they&#x27;re going to <br>
throw it into the wall (smashing the cube to bits)...(nobodys been <br>
stupid enough to go through with it though)<br>
<br>
Then everyone, EVERYONE says they have solved it once, or even they <br>
used to be able to do it in 5 mins or so, but just forgot <br>
EVERYTHING...lol<br>
<br>
but if you show your cube skillz at a party when everyones mostly <br>
drunk (including yourself)...everyone thinks your the MAN! :) hehe<br>

oh yeah, and don&#x27;t forget this one... &quot;whats the secret, I know that <br>

i&#x27;ve did the moves (R B L F) over and over and over again, (and <br>

again....(actually ive did it a couple times)...so that would be 315 <br>

This is probably the most common one I get. I really hate this one -- <br>

     Yes&#x27;m... Petrus was the first to.... de-flower me in the ways of 
the cube. Since then I&#x27;ve... refused any other as they just were not 
as enduring, consistant or as easy as Lars. :)
     It&#x27;s difficult for me to gauge how much more difficult Friedrich 
is to learn. Wait, no it isn&#x27;t.. it&#x27;s frickin HARD! I can only 
imagine what it&#x27;s like for brand new mini-cubers to start learning 
this method. The multitude of algorithms and extent of memorization 
is at best intimidating. Then again, I&#x27;ve never been good at 
memorization. The beauty of the Lars method is how the addition of 
one step (making bad edges good) and a handful of algorithms can 
compete with such an extensive method as the Friedrich. Another thing 
to consider is that I&#x27;m switching a method I&#x27;ve been using for 
months. It would be impossible for me to tell if this really affects 
things in the beginning, but I&#x27;m pretty sure when I&#x27;m 60 and pick up 
the new digitally enhanced, holographic helo-hover-cube, I&#x27;ll resort 
to Lars. You always remember your first eh?
    I don&#x27;t know which method you use to get 50s time so it&#x27;s tough 
for me to give you any hints. As a generic rule of thumb (from what 
I&#x27;ve noticed in the 6 or so months I&#x27;ve been doing this) the biggest 
cut-backs in time is putting algorithms into your &quot;muscle memory&quot; 
or &quot;subconscious&quot; however you want to put it. This allows for two 
things: speed limited only by your muscles, and the ability to &quot;look 
over your shoulder&quot; while doing the algorithm. Locating the cubies 
needed in my next step always helps me to &quot;cut my thinking time down 
to zero&quot; (Friedrich). In other words, you&#x27;re constantly turning the 
layers of the cube. It&#x27;s amazing how much those seconds spent 
thinking and finding pieces adds up to your total time. My biggest 
problem in the Lars&#x27;s method, however, is the first step. I average 
almost 10s on this one step! I have almost no ability to plan the 
2x2x2 completely in advance in the 15s &quot;looking time.&quot; I can barely 
do it with limitless time! I just can&#x27;t predict how positioning the 
cubies correctly will affect the other pieces I need.
    OKAY... there is NO WAY I&#x27;m good enough at cubing to be writing 
this much. The insanity must end here... right now.... instantly... 
with unyielding expedience.... now.

The cube explosion is definitely a problem. Even if it doesn&#x27;t 
necessarily explode, misalignment during your fingertricks can be 
very irritating and time-detremental. The cube I&#x27;ve been using for 
months is just about perfect. It can never be as loose as a brand new 
cube, and it always provides enough resistance to help slow down the 
layers as your zooming through your turns during finger tricks. (Oh 
and to Jasmine -- another huge cutdown in time stems from finger 
tricks if you didn&#x27;t already know and utilize that. It easly takes 
10 - 20 seconds off).

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure I follow.

After forming the 2x2x3 there will usually be some &#x27;good edges&#x27; and 
some &#x27;bad edges&#x27; on the two free sides. Turning those two sides is 
then necessary to make the bad edges --> good edges, and this can 
easily be done without interfering with the 2x2x3 (ie. can hold onto 
the 2x2x3 to make sure of this). If bad edges can be made &#x27;good&#x27; by 
holding the 2x2x3 (ie. not scrambling it at all) and turning the two 
free sides, then the reverse of the turns can make good edges &#x27;bad&#x27; 
again.

Does this make sense or am I talking about something different??

PS. I&#x27;d be interested to have a go at your suggested procedure for 
expanding the 2x2x3 --> 2x3x3 though, unfortunately it will have to 
be later though because I have to get back to work now (end of 
lunchtime for me!) Maybe your posting will make more sense to me once 
I try this. :)

          <div class="email-content">    I agree. It&#x27;s not corny. Maybe a little demonstrative of how 
little life you... and admittably I, have. I feel the same way about 
this site. I just saw it about 4 days ago and love talking to all of 
you. Within 4 days both Petrus AND Friedrich responded to me in some 
way and I was just in awe. And they both are so cool! (Little kissin 
up for Donnie) But seriously, they&#x27;re both funny and not snobby about 
their obviously refined abilities. I know when I break 20 I won&#x27;t 
care about anyone. But seriously... I won&#x27;t.
    Anyway, I wish I could find someone else in my area that was at 
least interested in learning how to cube. Like you said, none of them 
even have enough interest to actually do it. They just like it when I 
perform my act for them. And in moderation, despite comments to the 
contrary, it does get the ladies.

          <div class="email-content">My 2c towards the discussion about the hardness of methods, number 
of algorithms, etc. If you want to get to the top level of 
speedcubing (i.e., sub 20 average consistently), you will have to 
memorize lots of algorithms and perhaps even multitude of methods as 
well. And the better you want to be, the more algorithms you need to 
learn whether you are using my method, corners-first, or I believe 
Lars&#x27; method as well. There is simply no free lunch.

Just out of curiousity, Ron, Dan G, Dan K, and all other sub-20 
cubists, how many algorithms and what methods do you actively use?

          <div class="email-content">ok im thinkin back to when I was tryin Lars method, and about makin <br>
the bad edges good....and yes im fairly positive that to make the bad <br>
ones good you must temporially mess up your 2x2x3 block.....I think <br>
Donnie was sayin that you dont&#x27; wanna mess up your 2x2x3 block once <br>
you have all the edges &quot;good&quot;.<br>
<br>
that step and then solving the f2l with only the 2 free layers was i <br>
bit much for me...thats why I just keep adding onto my 2x2x3 block <br>
till i got the f2l completed (requires &quot;temporially&quot; breaking up the <br>
2x2x3)...i add on in a specific order though!...lol.....but doing it <br>
my way doesn&#x27;t help you out at all in the LL......so you still have <br>
to learn all thems algs to solve it in 2 looks....<br>

          <div class="email-content">anybody else have this &quot;problem&quot;....<br>
<br>
whenever I cube within about an hour or two before I &quot;try&quot; to go to <br>
sleep I can&#x27;t get to sleep...my mind is overwhelmed with thought, <br>
about anything and everything!  <br>
<br>
My only reasoning behind this kinda goes along with Chris Hs &quot;cube <br>
high&quot; theory...that is, when you cube and you do the algs and <br>
everything when you don&#x27;t have to think about the moves, your brain <br>
is trying to think and gives off this stuff(i can&#x27;t remember the <br>
name), which enduces thought or whatever, and so while cubing your <br>
brain is releasing this stuff thats not being used and you get an <br>
oversupply of it....which causes a sort of &quot;cube high&quot;...lol<br>
<br>
sleep is good, so in my attempts to get a lil more sleep i&#x27;ve been <br>
putting off cubing in the evenings...the only problem is thats like <br>
my &quot;best&quot; time to cube, Its just when im in the cubing mood I guess.  <br>
And when i have the time to do it....<br>
<br>
...just wondering if anybody else experiences these things, and what <br>
u do about it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s funny!  That is almost the exact opposite of what happens to <br>
me.  I rarely cube in the middle of any day.  I always cube for and <br>
hour or 2 before I go to sleep.  For me, however, I cube slowly, and <br>
without thinking about it during this hour or 2 period.  I cube <br>
slowly, rhythmically, and detach my brain from thinking about the <br>
cube as much as possible.  In this way, I dont&#x27; wind up my brain at <br>
all, rather, I wind it down from the busy day.  During this period, <br>
my brain is unlocked, and can sort out all the thoughts from the <br>
day.  It pieces everything together one by one, and when the hour is <br>
up, my mind is clear and ready for sleep.  So, I&#x27;m not like you <br>
apparently, in that cubing *helps* me get to sleep much easier, and <br>
much more peacefully.  Likewise, I cube right when I wake up, for <br>
speed this time, and for thought, and the mental exercise prepares my <br>
brain for the day.  That&#x27;s why I find it best for speed to cube in <br>
the morning, and best all around to cube at night.  Cubing at the <br>
extremes of the day, helps to start off and end each day well.  I <br>
guess then, my advice would be this:  Don&#x27;t cube for speed at night. <br>
Just go through the motions calmly.  (Note: this still may be much <br>
faster than you think you are going!)  and when you need to give your <br>
mind a jump start, especially before a math test or something, cube <br>
for speed, and think about your moves.  A relaxed approach before you <br>
sleep may actually help you out!<br>
<br>
Hope that makes sense!<br>

Just trying to get an idea of where my blindfold cubing is at at the <br>
moment.<br>
Recently I set a new PB of 9 minutes 40 seconds (total of <br>
memorization and solving) and am curious as to how that compares <br>
with other people (in terms of how much I need to speed up if I am <br>
to have a chance in the WChamps next year).<br>
Also, I am curious on multiple cubes. There are apparently at least <br>
2 people who can do the 5x5x5 blindfolded; I would have thought <br>
they&#x27;d find it a piece of cake to do 4 cubes blindfolded. What&#x27;s the <br>
progress on this?<br>

I used to get poppage all the damn time on it, because I wasn&#x27;t used to the<br>
loosness, but now I find it&#x27;s so rare.  It must be weeks since my last<br>
poppage now.  I guess I&#x27;ve kinda honed my muscle action to prevent it from<br>
happening.  I recently decided to get going on the revenge and I just about<br>
prevented a pop whilst being adventurous in an alg.  I hope that poppage on<br>
the revenge will be as rare as on the 3xCube, and I hope that I can hone my<br>
muscle action for this cube too.<br>

How often to the pro&#x27;s get poppage then?  I realise that you are subjecting<br>
your cubes to a lot more stresses and strains compared to my sedate style,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Dan,

it might be a little early to post this info here now - one year 
ahead of the event. Why do not you put it on the web page instead?

How many sponsors have you got already? Does it look promising at 
all? If I recall correctly, it was the lack of interest from sponsors 
that killed the earlier attempts to organize such an event.

know that they haven&#x27;t done this -- problem is that they think I&#x27;m 
watching to try and reverse the large number of random moves they&#x27;ve 
just used to mess it (I couldn&#x27;t do this even if I wanted to!!)

Something I often do to pre-empt this issue is tell them I can solve 
any combination formed by any number of turns of a solved cube.

If someone brings me a cube (eg. the messed one that has been sitting 
at the back of their cupboard for the last 10 years) and they don&#x27;t 
know if a single edge has been flipped or stickers have been put back 
in the wrong place then I always explain that it can only be solved 
by normal methods if it has not been tampered with (and then try to 
explain the mechanics of this -- usually resulting in dazed looks).

For these sorts of reasons I usually just demonstrate solutions using 
my own cube so I can be sure it&#x27;s okay!!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had several weird dreams about the cube.  Most almost nightmares <br>
if you are a cubomaniac.<br>
<br>
1. Solving cube on a rolleroaster and an edge pops.  That was a very <br>
BAD dream!!!  The whole cube disenigrated and i watched as each cubie <br>
pelted a passerby bellow.<br>
2. some of you might remember my virtual cube from a previous post.<br>
3. Finding a super rare cube in a store for like 5 bucks and you only <br>
have 4 dollars.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve had some more but those tend to freak me out the best<br>

          <div class="email-content">I really think its funny if try and walk a person through the cube <br>
and they point to an edge and asks &quot;how do you move it here?&quot; and <br>
points to a corner.<br>
<br>
Also they think the longer they scramble the cube the longer it takes <br>
to solve.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve ran into people that enjoy popping an edge and turning it <br>
around. But that is so easily detected at a point in the solution.  <br>
<br>
All in all I think extreme cubing is meant for those who are willing <br>
to put up with repetitive stupid, illogic, and outright histarical <br>
comments and phrases.  Still that sticker one erks us the most.  <br>
Especially with Rubiks stickers nowadays.<br>
Does anyone no what happened to the beautiful vinyl/ linolium <br>
stickers they used to use?<br>

Oh MY GOSH!!! I HATE THAT SO MUCH! And for someone to say that to 
Jessica is an abomination. If I may, a list of comments I receive 
frequently that really bug me. Some of them, I completely admit, are 
purely annoying because of my pride and show-off-i-ness. (Well... I 
worked hard to be able to show it off!) The rest bug me because I 
hear it SO OFTEN:

- &quot;Oh my gosh... I haven&#x27;t seen one of those in years!&quot;

- (I know we all get this one a lot, but it&#x27;s always worth 
mentioning) ::laughing hysterically as if they&#x27;re so original:: I 
always just peeled off the stickers and replaced them! HAHAHAHAAAA&quot; 
(Someone mentioned this on their cubing site, and since then the 
constant repitition just bugs.

- &quot;Did you know there&#x27;s a book somewhere that teaches you how to do 
that thing?&quot; OR &quot;You know, they solved that years ago.&quot;

- &quot;Isn&#x27;t there some trick to that?&quot;

- This one astounded me... after demonstrating my mad skillz to 
impress a new friend, he said: &quot;Oh don&#x27;t you just kinda go like this 
over and over to solve that?&quot; ::motions with his fingers a completely 
indiscernable pattern with his hands over and over::.

- &quot;Solved that yet?&quot; Or after they saw me just at the beginning of a 
solve the previous day, whereupon seeing me starting again the next 
day say: &quot;You&#x27;re still working on that? Just give it up!!&quot; (This is 
an example of a purely prideful annoyance. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just stare 
for a second and say quickly, loudly and monotone: &quot;I can do it in 40 
seconds.&quot; Usually they just give me a look like, man he&#x27;s full of 
himself. And they&#x27;re probably right.

- 15 year old comes up and says &quot;Oh I solved that once.&quot; (This bugs 
because it means one of two things: He&#x27;s either lying to impress me, 
or he actually solved it on his own at 15).

- You&#x27;re showing someone who&#x27;s never seen you do it before and you 
ask them to time you. They&#x27;re more than happy to oblige but then 
consider it cheating when you ask for 15 seconds to look at it. Isn&#x27;t 
it enough I can solve it in a lifetime? Just gimme the damned 15 
seconds!!

That&#x27;s about all I can think about right now. Any others out there? 
I&#x27;ve seen some great ones so far..

I did not find that comment offending at all. To the contrary - it 
was the funniest comment I ever received :) Come on, it is just a 
puzzle and we do it for fun, right?

I do not get too many comments in general. But then, I do not cube in 
public often. I typically bring the cube to airports and planes. The 
comment I receive the most is &quot;Wow, you are fast!&quot; and &quot;What is the 
world record?&quot; A lot of people ask more and I usually end up giving 
them my business card so that they can look at my system in detail. I 
am typically approached by highly educated men. I guess, the comments 
must somehow depend on your age, too, and the way you present 
yourself.

Still, my favorite funny cube-related story is in the ninth paragraph 
at http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/history.html

I beleve that most of the persons saying they´ve solved the cube once 
some times must be lying! But there is thow some people that actually 
manage to solve it by themselfe in early ages. But they have to be 
some kind of fanatics to do so, in my case I was 13 when I first 
solved it by myselfe. I used a tecnic when forming a 2*2*3 to begin 
with and then play with the cube until it has all the 8 corners 
solved. The solve two opposit layers and then the middle one.

My technic was to put opposite colors together and then, use simple 
rotating or swaping fromulas (like (R2 U2)^3) to complete the cube. 
Of course, this is not a good method (in fact, it was incomplete). It 
sometimes took me more than 30 minutes to slove the entire cube. But 
I was able to do it! But today, I don&#x27;t remember how I was doing... 
So don&#x27;t say that poeple &quot;who used to solved the cube&quot; are lying!
By the way, using a layer system, I now average 32 seconds with a

Aye, but at least you remember the principle behind your former method.<br>

where I&#x27;m completely focused on that for hours, in years. Decades 
even.

I think my last casual averaging session during boring parts of TV 
resulted in 26, I&#x27;m certain I could get down to at least 24 if I did 
it seriously. Sometimes I get in The Zone and do 17-21 very easily 
for 5 times or so, but then I get so excited I lose it. Hopefully 
that&#x27;s my real level. Then again sometimes I get in another &quot;zone&quot; 
and can&#x27;t get under 30, so...

Anyway, I&#x27;m clearly not a candidate for winning the World 
Championship, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have fun there anyway.

   Ok, so I&#x27;ve heard numerous testimonies of the hand pains, cramps <br>
and injuries associated with this hobby, err... lifestyle of ours. I <br>
was wondering, though, what pains, specifically are commonly <br>
associated with cubing? I mean, I can understand why your wrists <br>
would ache, or if your thumb muscles cramp or whatever... but have <br>
any of you also experienced an almost arthritic presence in the <br>
joints of your fingers? I&#x27;m really hoping that this is just a normal <br>
side effect of cubing because I don&#x27;t want to be 19 and already <br>
beginning to get tendonitis or arthritis. If you all could just tell <br>
me what kind of pains you experience on a regular basis, please do <br>
tell. I know about Rubik&#x27;s wrist and cubist&#x27;s thumb... but feel free <br>
to go over that too. I love cubing, but I don&#x27;t want to have a <br>
detrimental affect the rest of my life.<br>

This subject has been discussed on here before.  Mathematically speaking,<br>
7x7x7 would be possible if some compromises are made.  One way of achieving<br>
it is to make the cubies that are nearer the middle smaller.  This means<br>
that the edge pieces would be oblong and the corners would be the biggest<br>
pieces.  Another way, as Rube discovered, is to make the cube bulge a bit,<br>
thus creating some room by not making it a real cube shape as such.<br>
<br>
I hope someone will work on these designs and make something soon.  I&#x27;ll<br>
master the 5x5x5 any day now and I&#x27;ll be needing something a little harder<br>
to get my hands on.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I also find that I can easily carry on a conversation and solve the <br>
cube and it seems like my brain (which is focussing on the <br>
conversation) and my hands (running through the motions of cube <br>
solving, pretty much on auto-pilot) aren&#x27;t connected! Non-cubers <br>
watching find this particularly freaky. Most people find it <br>
incredibly impressive to even see someone solve the cube, but it <br>
blows them away when they see it done so casually, while carrying on <br>
a conversation, and without even looking at the cube a lot of the <br>
time.<br>
<br>
I also find the same thing with the piano. Like cube algorithms, if <br>
it&#x27;s a piece of music I know really well (ie. it&#x27;s in my <br>
subconscious) then once I start playing I go into auto-pilot. Another <br>
similiarity to the cube is that if a piece of music goes into my <br>
subconscious I find it difficult to play in any other form than auto-<br>
pilot, for example, I can&#x27;t just think about the bass part and play <br>
that part by itself. If a cube algorithm has gone into my <br>
subconscious then I can&#x27;t explain it to anyone unless I have a cube <br>
in my hands -- it&#x27;s almost like my brain has forgotten the actual <br>
moves and it&#x27;s my hands that remember!!<br>
<br>
The musical instrument/Rubik&#x27;s cube connection is not surprising <br>
really because there are many basic similarities between playing an <br>
instrument and solving a cube -- digital dexterity, complex sequences <br>
of patterns to perform, thinking ahead to maintain a flow and make <br>
sure your fingers/hands are in the right place to move to the next <br>
sequence, etc.<br>
<br>
I saw that someone else has the same experiences with playing the <br>
cello. I&#x27;d be interested to hear if other people find it&#x27;s the same <br>
with other things (other than musical instruments)?<br>

RSI is BAD NEWS!! I know cubing is fun and addictive but it&#x27;s not <br>

          <div class="email-content">I wasn&#x27;t around when the 7X7X7 cube was discussed.  However, it is a rather 
interesting idea to use cublets of non-uniform size.  It would make a rather 
ugly cube but it would be 7X7X7!  I wonder what the size limit would be 
then?  Meanwhile I will start thinking about how to make such a cube.

I know that cubing won&#x27;t cause arthritis; that it will only worsen 
the pain if you already have it. That&#x27;s why it scares me. I get pain 
in the joints after I cube for awhile. I&#x27;m wondering if completely 
normal, arthritis-free people feel knuckle pain after cubing for 
awhile. If you don&#x27;t... then there&#x27;s prob something wrong with me 
that I should get checked out. Thanks for the help!

Yep, know what you mean. I&#x27;m finding that while I&#x27;m learning a new 
method, I&#x27;m constantly seeing how it relates to the algorithms I 
already know.

And to make another analogy with musical instruments, I find that 
regardless of what instrument I&#x27;m playing I still &#x27;think&#x27; in piano 
(my first instrument). Sometimes when I&#x27;m playing my flute, I&#x27;m 
actually visualising the notes being played on a piano in my head! I 
find this is especially so when I&#x27;m learning a new instrument or a 
new piece of music, it&#x27;s like I need to translate everything 
into &#x27;piano&#x27; to do the mental processing.

out of the box. The other annoying thing is that most of the cubes 
are packaged up and so can&#x27;t be tested before purchasing anyway! I 
sometimes ask the shop assistant if they have any opened onesthat I 
could have a play with to check whether they&#x27;re okay.

I think you&#x27;ll find that there are many people (including many people 
on this site) who first solved the cube before the age of 15. I was 
10 years old when I first did the cube. At the time I was probably 
averaging about 80-90 seconds with a best time of just under a minute.

The reason I feel behind now is because, many years on, I haven&#x27;t 
really improved much at all, it still usually takes me about a minute 
to solve!!

I tend to agree. There&#x27;s a big difference between not remembering the 
exact twists in the algorithms you used to use and claiming to have 
solved the cube once with no real system. The likelihood of just 
making random twists and happening to stumble upon the 1 combination 
of the 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations that is the 
solved cube!!

I wish there was renewed interested in Rubik&#x27;s stuff here in

I can understand that!  When I first started cubing, little over a year ago<br>
now, I watched videos by DK and Ron for ideas.  I thought it was freaky and<br>
mind bending watching some of the finger tricks.  At the time I hadn&#x27;t heard<br>

don&#x27;t look so odd now, and I can sometimes keep up with them too :)<br>

  I would get on that as soon as you can. It&#x27;s probably the big 
reason you&#x27;re looming around the 1-minute dolldrums. It&#x27;s awkward at 
first, and you&#x27;ll say to yourself &quot;self, I could never actually put 
this to practice. It&#x27;s just a fun-looking flourish.&quot; But once you 
practice the motions for a few days, there will inevitably come a 
point during your regular ol&#x27; solve where unconsciously your hands 
will just do the move! It&#x27;s a freaky step, but you&#x27;ll be really happy 
when you find 1-minute a detestable score. 
  I strongly suggest you look at: 

http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints

   And click on the very first link that says &quot;slow.&quot; It shows a very 
useful way to switch, diagonally, the edges. Because of that video, 
it&#x27;s my most favoritest position to get in. But besides being useful, 
it demonstrates a bazillion trigger techniques. It&#x27;s a whole lesson 
in one algorithm. The hard part is around the middle where you move 
two layers simultaneously... that took a lot of practice for me. 
Anyway, just a tip. 
   It&#x27;s also difficult to see what orientation you need to hold the 
cube initially. If you&#x27;re stuck, he&#x27;s holding it so that the very top 
of LL, by now with solid colors on top, is closest his body. From 
here just do the motion and you&#x27;ll see if you&#x27;ve got the correct 
layer facing UP. It&#x27;s by far my favorite algorithm now.

I know a lot of people solved it on their own pre-15. It doesn&#x27;t mean 
I have to like it :). Nor does it mean I want to meet them if they 
are of the type to gloat (as if it&#x27;s not something deserved to gloat

          <div class="email-content"><br>
   I have to be the most impatient being on this planet. As some of <br>
you know I&#x27;ve been switching to Fridrich&#x27;s method from Lars&#x27;s in the <br>
hopes that it will cut down my times. I&#x27;ve been at it for about 5 <br>
days and I still haven&#x27;t hit 20s! (Just kidding... not that <br>
impatient.) I just timed myself and I seem to average about 1:10s on <br>
the F2L using about 2/3 of the &quot;all possible F2L&quot; algs I&#x27;ve memorized <br>
so far. I&#x27;m noticing a few problems that I hoped some of you could <br>
help with:<br>
<br>
_The Cross:_<br>
<br>
Getting the cross is easy, but I can&#x27;t seem to be able to examine the <br>
cube and memorize all 7-10 moves needed to get to the cross. This <br>
means I&#x27;m constantly looking for the cubies I need, and turning the <br>
cube around in my hands which takes tons of time.<br>
<br>
_F2L:_<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s how I do it: I pick a &quot;corner area&quot; (the space where a corner <br>
piece should end up (ie Red-White-Green with white as the color of <br>
the cross)) and go hunt for the corner that fits it. I swing it into <br>
its appropriate &quot;column&quot; on the cube (between the red and green <br>
faces.) Then I hunt for its corresponding edge-piece. If it&#x27;s already <br>
on the top layer, I do a &quot;mental search query&quot; for the correct <br>
algorithm and do it. If it&#x27;s a position I don&#x27;t know yet, I&#x27;ll morph <br>
the position to fit an alg I do know.<br>
  However, if the edge-piece is in an incorrect &quot;column&quot; (ie between <br>
blue and orange) I make exactly 3 moves to get it to the top layer. <br>
1st move breaks the cross and gets the edge-piece up on the top <br>
layer. 2nd move moves the edge-piece out of the way. 3rd move <br>
restores the cross (The same goes if the corner piece is on the <br>
bottom layer between incorrect faces). Then I search for an <br>
algorithm, etc.<br>
<br>
_LL:_<br>
<br>
Haven&#x27;t even gotten started. I just practice F2L right now.<br>
<br>
    I figure that the cross portion is just practice, with very few <br>
hints associated with it. If you have any, please let me know. But <br>
what really concerns me is F2L. Am I doing it the right way? Should I <br>
JUST move the edge-piece to the top layer and then find an alg, <br>
restoring the cross at a later time? If someone could tell me what is <br>
going on in their brain RIGHT after the cross is completed in the <br>
beginning and about to start F2L, it would help me a lot. Especially <br>
from the master herself. Thanks!<br>

Not very efficient. Look for first layer corners that are already on 
the third layer, then go hunting for the corresponding edge.  Most of 
the time you can find one.  If not, look for a f2l edge piece on the 
third layer, and look for the corner.  Very rarely, all of the 
unsolved f2l pieces are misplaced on the first two layers.  In which 
case, bring a corner to the third layer and continue.

Sounds like you could use some practice solving for number of turns 
instead of speed.  Try solving the f2l in about 35 turns.

          <div class="email-content">Donnie,

do not sweat the cross. If you can do 3, do just three and then, as 
you are inserting them, look for the fourth one. It is OK to use, say 
10 moves to do the cross instead of the optimal 7 or so. Do not try 
to memorize the cross at all price. I sometimes do it exactly this 
way if the cubies are scattered in unfavorable positions.

F2L requires a lot of experience but is lighting fast once mastered. 
Instead of memorizing the algs from my page, try to develop your own 
algs and then learn only those that you are having problems with. Do 
not just apply the algs blindly.

Here is my advice. 
1) There are two basic ways to bring a corner from the LL into the 
1st layer (OK, with the exception when the white is on the bottom): 
the one that picks up a distant edge along the way and the one that 
inserts the corner and the edge that is right behind it. Both moves 
are 3 (or 4) moves long. Now, 90% of the situations can be composed 
of combinations of those two basic moves. The remaining 10% are less 
obvious but only a move or two shorter than those &quot;obvious&quot; composed 
of those two basic moves. The secret is that you do not really need 
any special algs for the F2L. The savings you gain from using the 
shortest ones instead of the obvious ones make a small difference 
that becomes important only when you try to get below 20.

2) In the beginning right after the cross, you can use even simpler 
and shorter moves to insert the edges because you can use the fact 
that no corner-edge pair is in place. Again, those simple 3-move 
basic &quot;algorithms&quot; can do the job.

3) Finally, when I finish the cross, I look at the last layer 
searching for pairs of cubies. In most cases, there is at least one 
pair already. Do that one and then repeat again. If you at some point 
do not see any pairs in the LL, you can do the following. Say, you 
have a corner in the LL and the edge is somewhere in the middle in 
some incorrect place. Then use the bottom layer to move the corner to 
the edge (or down-left or down-right - I hope you know what I mean) 
and do that 3-move to &quot;pick up&quot; that edge. You can always pick it up 
into one of the two positions that will only need one of those basic 
moves to insert the pair into the correct place. 

You rarely, very rarely, need to remove a corner (or edge) in order 
to proceed. That will hold you back. Usually, you can do something 
like I described, which is fast, filled with two-side moves, finger 
shortcuts, and it is easy to see.

4) Go slowly. The system works best when you do not apply the algs 
blindly but rather you try to minimize the number of moves, ignoring 
the time for a while. This is why I also always advice to forget 
about the time and, instead, start paying attention to the number of 
moves in the F2L. Then, _very_gradually_ increase the speed. This is 
the best warm up as well, by the way. Much better than twisting like 
crazy right from the moment you pick up the cube.

I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, let me know.

I think it would be kewl if everyone had a video, especially the 
faster people (sub 20 or 30)...and the people who use a little 
different method.....like ME...lol.......I need to get a video too, I 
just gotta find someone with a good quality digital video camera, and 
i&#x27;ve been tryin for some time....

Then there are the thousands who participated in the US championships <br>
who aren&#x27;t on these boards.  Discounting those, of the 57 on the <br>

contest hasn&#x27;t created a cube isolation, cuz I was liking the advice I <br>

          <div class="email-content">Doesn&#x27;t sound weird at all. I just can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 20 years 
since the last championships. It&#x27;s totally understandable that a lot 
of the participants would lose interest and retire. I guess as a &quot;50-
second&quot; cubist at the time, I retired for a while, but I guess the 
fever is back now.

It will be interesting to see if the &quot;old school&quot; of Jessica and Lars 
can overcome the challenge from the kids who weren&#x27;t even born when 
Minh Thai first one the championships.

   Hello everyone. I just found out a few minutes ago that this <br>
competition is the first in 21 years! I sure hope that it can be a <br>
bit more frequent in the years to come. I&#x27;m certain a little ESPN <br>
coverage in USA would spark some interest again (I&#x27;m one of those who <br>
was not yet born when Minh set the record by the way). Anyway, I <br>
noticed on the list of top 20 at the last championship, that if you <br>
could beat about 50 seconds, you could make the top 20. I average <br>
about 42 seconds and would just be honored to make it on that board. <br>
My question to you guys is, do you think the cubists nowadays have <br>
evolved their times enough to make any hopes of my making the top 20 <br>
obliterated? I&#x27;m tempted to compete just to say I did it, but if <br>
cubing has grown such that only sub 30&#x27;ers need apply, I&#x27;m not sure <br>
it would be worth it for me. I don&#x27;t even know if I am able to <br>
compete. What is the procedure to be a competitor? Thanks all!<br>
<br>
-Donnie<br>
<br>
P.S. Maybe by then I&#x27;ll have figured out that Fridrich and have <br>
gotten down to competitive times. (I&#x27;m still reading your response to <br>
me Jessica, I really appreciate that! Some of it confuses me so far, <br>
but I&#x27;m going to make sense of it, and if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll ask ya.)<br>

  I&#x27;ve been actively checking this site for about a week now and have 
not heard anything about a Saturday chat. I assumed you had weekly 
chat meetings but I&#x27;d never seen it plainly advertised. I agree with 
dan... it should really be displayed at first page-load.

Also i think everyone should register for the competition regardless <br>

from a best time of 1:10 to 31 sec. in one year!! av wise went from <br>
1:30ish to 50ish!  If i can keep on working like this I&#x27;ll be in good <br>
shape for the RWC.  Keep at it everyone!!!<br>

Hey Tyler, where have you been hidding????  I picked up a UFO and <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not completely sure I know which orientation you&#x27;re referring to, 
but if I&#x27;m right, try this:
R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27;

Not quite the R U R&#x27; F start you though, but it&#x27;s close...  Just to 
make sure I&#x27;m talking about the right orientation, is this right?:
- Two edges are correct F and B
- Two edges are incorrect (duh) R and L
- The two front corners (UFR and UFL) need to turn counter clockwise
- and the other two corners (UBR and UBL) need to turn clockwise

I just painted the result of this starting position and your first 
four steps into Ron&#x27;s cube solver applet 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/CubeSolver/CubeSolver.html), and that was 
the first thing it found...  Seems like a good sequence to me :-)

It has the same effect on the cube (orientation and positioning) as 
the first algo on Fridrich&#x27;s page...

Hey...I like that alg....except I changed it to R&#x27;U&#x27;R U&#x27;R&#x27;U F&#x27;U F 
R.........im trying to decide between that one, and R&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;U F&#x27;L F L&#x27;F 
R.....with the one u gave me I only have to change my grip on the 
cube once, and with the other I have to change my grip 3 times....so 
i&#x27;ll probably endup using yours(I did change it to the front of the 
cube insted of the back though) :D....thanks again...

It is not the way you used to do it but try it this way:

(R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;(DE))(R&#x27;URB)

(DE) = the 2 bottom layers clockwise

wow....thats pretty much the same thing as i was doing except holding 
on to the top layer and moving the 2 bottom layers, insted of 
changing my grip on the cube.......this one has promise 
also....thanks Peter...

  Thank you for the help Jessica! Here are a few Q&#x27;s:

Thank you, this helps. Did it take you a lot of practice to be able to 
memorize your moves or was this natural for you?

 
> Instead of memorizing the algs from my page, try to develop your own 
> algs and then learn only those that you are having problems with.

I actually use algs from speedcubing.com. I&#x27;d use yours, but I&#x27;m not 
certain where, in the cube graphic, the cross is. And at first I was 
trying to memorize them outright, but there came a day when I was just 
unable to remember all the &quot;memorization&quot; and suddenly just started to 
turn sides. 8 out of 10 times I was correct... it was weird. Anyway, 
through memorization I realized a lot of key &quot;reasons&quot; for moves and 
just started doing them myself.

    When you say picking up a distant edge along the way, is this 
regardless of its orientation? Are you simply getting the two together 
so you can perform an algorithm? If so, does this mean the majority of 
the F2L algorithms on your page take place with the corner in the LL 
and the edge directly connected?

Can do.

By &quot;pair&quot; do you mean that the corner-piece and the edge-piece are 
right next to each other? If so, are they correctly oriented? Or do 
you mean that the corner and its matching edge piece are simply 
somewhere, in some orientation, on the LL?



>If you at some point do not see any pairs in the LL, you can do the 
following. Say, you

  I&#x27;m not sure I know what you mean. OK... you&#x27;re holding a cube with 
the corner you want in upper-right. The edge piece is middle left. Are 
you saying I should move, say, R&#x27;D&#x27;F or something similar? 
  Also, when you&#x27;re &quot;escaping&quot; the corner and its edge from the bottom 
and/or middle layer into the LL, do you immediately restore the cross 
you broke to get it up there? Or do you wait until the pieces are 
together, for example?

I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by remove a corner.

Will this actually help me significantly? The way I imagine it would 
go, would be that I sit down for weeks and go slowly, trying to do few 
moves. Then when I actually tried to speed cube, my mind would just be 
racing and I wouldn&#x27;t have the ability to think about those things. 
After doing few moves for a long time, does your brain recognize 
enough patterns from previous few-move-solves to cut your time down 
significantly in practice? Or is it like a guitar teacher telling you 
to sit &quot;just so&quot; in order to enhance your playing, when its effects 
are really negligible? Not that I doubt your advice, I just have 
always wondered what of the tips I&#x27;ve heard are just &quot;good habits.&quot;

P.S. How is your last name pronounced? Is it Fr-ih-drich, as in 
Rub-i-k or Fr-ee-drich as in Rubik&#x27;s R-ee-venge? And same to you 
Lars!! Is it P-eh-trus as in pock-eh-t cube (ahh forget it) or 
P-ee-trus. Petr-oo-s or Petr-uh-s?

   Yah, the stickers seem to be the biggest problem with cubes today. 
When I get a brand new cube I wait maybe a week before replacing the 
stickers. You can replace the stickers either by ordering 
replacements off of Rubiks.com, which I don&#x27;t recommend, or do what 
most do and get 6 different colors of vinyl electrical tape. I found 
all colors except orange from my local hardware store. However, I 
couldn&#x27;t find Orange ANYWHERE!! I went to all the big name stores 
hardware stores and could only find half-an-inch wide orange tape. 
Well, let&#x27;s just say my dad got lucky while on a short vacation in 
New Mexico, 3 states away. I hope you have better luck. Anyway, I 
just peel off an original sticker, and cut out a template out of 
cardboard or something slightly stiff. Then I start cuttin&#x27; out the 
stickers! It&#x27;s lasted me about 6 months now and I&#x27;ve only replaced 3 
since then. Great stuff...

&gt; you saying I should move, say, R&#x27;D&#x27;F or something similar?<br>
<br>
F&#x27; D&#x27; F<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, when you&#x27;re &quot;escaping&quot; the corner and its edge from the <br>
bottom <br>
&gt; and/or middle layer into the LL, do you immediately restore the <br>
cross <br>
&gt; you broke to get it up there? Or do you wait until the pieces are <br>
&gt; together, for example?<br>
<br>
LL is up? Yes, I always put it back.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; You rarely, very rarely, need to remove a corner (or edge) in <br>
order <br>
&gt; &gt; to proceed. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by remove a corner.<br>
<br>
Nothing is in the LL, all cubies are somewhere in the F2L but <br>
incorrectly placed or positioned.<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt; 4) Go slowly. The system works best when you do not apply the <br>
&gt; Will this actually help me significantly? The way I imagine it <br>
would <br>
&gt; go, would be that I sit down for weeks and go slowly, trying to do <br>
few <br>
&gt; moves. Then when I actually tried to speed cube, my mind would <br>
just be <br>
&gt; racing and I wouldn&#x27;t have the ability to think about those <br>
things. <br>
&gt; After doing few moves for a long time, does your brain recognize <br>
&gt; enough patterns from previous few-move-solves to cut your time <br>
down <br>
&gt; significantly in practice? Or is it like a guitar teacher telling <br>
you <br>
&gt; to sit &quot;just so&quot; in order to enhance your playing, when its <br>
effects <br>
&gt; are really negligible? Not that I doubt your advice, I just have <br>
&gt; always wondered what of the tips I&#x27;ve heard are just &quot;good habits.&quot;<br>
<br>
By going slowly, you will develop &quot;economical&quot; twisting rather than <br>
speedy twisting that is inefficient. You will learn how to &quot;see&quot; the <br>
cubies, how to register several of them at a brief glance, how to <br>
predict where they will end up after you do certain short moves, <br>
etc. <br>
<br>
If you try to go too fast, you will be doing many more moves than <br>
you really need. Trust me, the twisting speed is one of the less <br>
important factors, actually. Ron, Dan, help me with this. Am I <br>
telling a lie? :)<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

I know that feeling.  I was recently away on business and I shared a hotel<br>

got bored but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to cube while he was in the room.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A weird thing happened today. I decided to finally set up the<br>
camcorder and shoot a video of my solving, as I have been<br>
procrastinating about for a year or so.<br>

Long story short: To my amazement, I produced my personal best time<br>
ever today, on camera! My previous 20+ year old record was 15.92 sec.<br>
Today I did 14.87.<br>
<br>
As any record, it&#x27;s a lucky time, of course. Both Step 5 (1 chance in<br>
6) and Step 6 (1 chance in 27) were solved when I came to the final<br>
layer. It&#x27;s not quite only luck, since I can choose from 1 of 2-4<br>
final layer situations when I get to the end of step 4, but something<br>
that only happens once in 50 solutions or so.<br>
<br>
But it wasn&#x27;t really an isolated random thing either. I have footage<br>
of a 16.16 and a few 18-somethings, all done within 30 minutes or so.<br>
Probably my best session ever. And with a cube that&#x27;s decidedly less<br>
that super smooth.<br>
<br>
I made a Quicktime movie of the 14.87. It&#x27;s 4.3MB, so I decided to<br>
try to distribute it with Gnutella. The file name is &quot;Lars Petrus<br>
solves the cube in 14,87 sec.mov&quot;. Try to search for it on LimeWire<br>
or some other Gnutella client, and see if you can grab it.<br>
<br>
This is so weird. I *really* thought I was far too old and out of<br>
practice for things like this...<br>

   No but seriously, Lars... that&#x27;s awesome! Congrats! I imagine 
things get very boring when you&#x27;re as good as you are... personal 
record-breaking is a rarity. And to get it on video!! I actually 
can&#x27;t find it yet on LimeWire but I&#x27;ll keep looking. I don&#x27;t suppose 
there&#x27;s any possibility of posting it on a page or something? Or give 
it to the webmaster of this page to send out via mass e-mail? I&#x27;ve 
never ever seen someone speed cube using your method. Well, once and 
it took him 1.5 minutes. Not very exciting. (I have my own though... 
33 seconds :)  )  Aaaaanywho. Congrats again and keep on shootin for 
that 10-second sign-of-armageddon record time!

on this URL:

You need QuickTime to watch it, which you can get at 
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qt/

Gnutella doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well as I expected... I think 
you need to be &quot;near&quot; my computer in the Gnutella network to see my 
files, and that&#x27;s probably a real small part of the whole Internet.

I&#x27;ll probably make at least one more file out of the batch. After a 
while I rigged up the camera so it looks over my shoulder, and that 
gives pretty much the view I see. As opposed to this one where you 
mostly see my hands and the already solved parts.

I guess I&#x27;ll just upload that too to the site. Unless there is some 
kind of size limit we&#x27;ll hit other than the 20MB?

have learned.  So over the past few days I&#x27;ve been wondering a <br>

much practice is there each day?  I just want to get to about a <br>

          <div class="email-content">About a month ago I was working diligently on memorizing the <br>
orientation cases. I addition to the 7 or so I had learned from <br>
mastering the 3-look, I had probably memorized close to 15-20 more. <br>
But then I went on vacation to my father&#x27;s house and didn&#x27;t bring a <br>
cube or my notes. I did this mostly because I knew I&#x27;d be playing <br>
computer games the whole time. This was a horrible mistake though as <br>
I have forgotten all the orientation cases I had so previously worked <br>
hard to remember. There is hope though. I think that even though I <br>
forgot them, it should be easier to remember them the second time <br>
through. <br>
<br>
Since people are talking about videos, I may as well plug mine. It&#x27;s <br>
a 26 second video and you can download it at <br>
http://homepages.spider.lu/liquid/26sec.wmv and be sure to tell me <br>
what you think. At the very end I miss a trigger on the permutation <br>
and waste about half a second. I also seem to take about 2 seconds <br>
looking for my first corner/edge pair after completing the cross. I <br>
find it difficult to look for it while I&#x27;m completely the cross. I <br>
imagine this can be solved with some more practice though and slowing <br>
myself down more. Anyway, ta ta for now...<br>

I&#x27;m not sure I follow the question but there are some moves which 
will yield the same result if the cube is differently oriented, if 
that&#x27;s what you mean (obviously the superflip is one and then the 
orientation doesn&#x27;t matter).
One such move is R&#x27;U&#x27;RL2U&#x27;R2B2R&#x27;L2U&#x27;R&#x27;UD2R&#x27;U2F2U&#x27;D2 which is a move 
I recently found on Cube Explorer 2.21 (looks like Windows has some 
advantages after all).
This move can be done with the cube in 3 different orientations and 
has the same effect (basically, fix the position of DFL corner but 
then there are 3 ways to orient the cube).
Lots of other such moves exist.

          <div class="email-content">Hi: welcome to the group!<br>
<br>
How often / long you would need to practise in order to improve will be <br>
different from person to person, and will also depend on how you practise.  <br>
If all your &quot;practise&quot; is, is solving the cube again and again, you will not <br>
improve as quickly as if you practise in a more strategic, intelligent <br>
manner. Also, a key component to speedcubing is physical, so practising <br>
every day is a big help for developing your muscular &quot;memory&quot;.<br>
<br>
Using finger-tricks on a well-lubricated cube makes a huge difference; if <br>
you are not sure what I&#x27;m talking about check out Dan Kight&#x27;s videos on his <br>
web-page.  If you&#x27;re keen to get your speed down, I strongly recommend using <br>
finger tricks from the start.<br>
<br>
That said, I reckon if someone practises well for about 1.5 to 2 hrs a day, <br>
five days a week, they could reach the 1 minute mark within ten weeks, and <br>
maybe quite a bit sooner.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>
S.<br>
PS get your friend to work on it too, nothing like some competition to give <br>
you some incentive ...<br>
<br>
&gt;So, hi.  I just started cubing a couple days ago when I read about a<br>
&gt;friend doing it in 4 minutes...I thought that was impossibly fast so<br>
&gt;I found an old cube and found Lars&#x27;s method first and that is what I<br>

          <div class="email-content">Jessica: can you give an algorithm that generates a cube-state such that <br>
when you do F U&#x27; F&#x27; U the cube state is only different in that the patterns <br>
have all shifted around the cube as a whole? (which is, I think, the start <br>
of the question?  Or am I off beam?).  Presumably this is a ll <br>
orientation/permutation alg.   I suppose it is natural that someone would <br>
only notice this doing the ll; if it happened on a less-solved cube you <br>
probably wouldn&#x27;t notice that the pattern had moved around the cube in such <br>

&gt;Of course, three-cycle of corners is not the position that can have<br>
&gt;this property.<br>

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not sure I follow the question but there are some moves which<br>
&gt; &gt; will yield the same result if the cube is differently oriented, if<br>
&gt; &gt; that&#x27;s what you mean (obviously the superflip is one and then the<br>
&gt; &gt; orientation doesn&#x27;t matter).<br>
&gt; &gt; One such move is R&#x27;U&#x27;RL2U&#x27;R2B2R&#x27;L2U&#x27;R&#x27;UD2R&#x27;U2F2U&#x27;D2 which is a<br>
&gt;move<br>
&gt; &gt; I recently found on Cube Explorer 2.21 (looks like Windows has<br>
&gt;some<br>
&gt; &gt; advantages after all).<br>
&gt; &gt; This move can be done with the cube in 3 different orientations<br>
&gt;and<br>
&gt; &gt; has the same effect (basically, fix the position of DFL corner but<br>
&gt; &gt; then there are 3 ways to orient the cube).<br>
&gt; &gt; Lots of other such moves exist.<br>

I have a firewire camcorder.  My Mac runs OSX and it has firewire ports.<br>
iMovie is available for free.  Simply plug the camera in, no drivers<br>

I&#x27;m interpreting this as this kind of position:

R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R&#x27;B2R2

(possibly with the whole cube turned around the z axis) 

but then FU&#x27;F&#x27;U doesn&#x27;t seem to do what you describe unless my 
interpretation is far different from what you mean.

Can you describe the initial position (as in the sequence you&#x27;d need 
to do on a solved cube to get the position you intend).

          <div class="email-content">Lars,  I don&#x27;t mean to split hairs here but, I make your solution to be 13.9<br>
seconds!  This is like how I time myself, I lose about a second just by<br>
operating a wrist watch.  So rather than find an easier way to time myself I<br>
just deduct a second from what I see on my watch.<br>
<br>
And although you say that you had some lucky stages on that attempt, I&#x27;ll<br>
bet you could have knocked a quarter of a second off at the pause near the<br>
end.  So, I&#x27;m really impressed with that little show off video  :]<br>
<br>
Also, I can&#x27;t help thinking that your fingers seem quite long and slender.<br>
Is this a favourable trait in the world of speed cubing?  Do others that<br>
average such low times consider themselves to have slender fingers?  I have<br>
long but chunky fingers so I sometimes get jammed against my own thumb when<br>
trying slice moves  :[<br>

If you have a digital camcorder (one that has Firewire, a.k.a. IEEE 
1394 plugs on it), you get a Fireware card for your PC to transfer 
the video to your PC.  Such cards usually come with video editing 
software that you can use to trim the video down to the apppropriate 
length and convert to popular formats (like MPEG).

If you have a non-digital camcorder, you need a video card with TV or 
NTSC (if you are in the US) input.  Some video cards, like the ATI 
All In Wonder cards, come with TV input.  I have an ASUS V7100 Deluxe 
Combo card that works ok for this.  If you want to spend less, you 
can buy a cheaper card that works with your existing video card to 
add video input capabilities.  One such card is the ATI TV Wonder.  
This type of card can probably be found for less than $50.  Some of 
these cards come with personal video recorder (PVR) software so that 
you can use your PC sort of like a Tivo and record TV shows.

Lastly, if you don&#x27;t have a video camera at all, you can use a 
webcam.  The quality won&#x27;t be nearly as good.

          <div class="email-content">Let me preface what I say with this - I by no means would consider 
myself an expert (I&#x27;m still averaging over 30 seconds), but here&#x27;s 
several thoughts:
- I think some algorithms lend themselves more easily to be 
remembered and/or performed with two hands...
- Use of two hands doesn&#x27;t have to be a replacement for finger 
tricks... Use them together, see if that helps...
- Be careful that you don&#x27;t use two hands more than necessary... At 
least for me, when I shift the cube between hands, I know this slows 
the flow considerably...

if nothing else worked for you, i could either put Lars video in my 
shared Kazaa folder and you could try to find it....file name 
is &quot;lars petrus cubing&quot; OR, i could send it direct to you thru MSN or 
Yahoo messengers....i have a fairly fast connection speed, (DSL)...it 
took 16 seconds to download the vid from the group file :D

          <div class="email-content">I love stories like this. I&#x27;m always interested to hear how people 
got into speedcubing. Here&#x27;s my story...

I think I was about 4-5 yrs old when the cube craze first hit the 
world. The cube interested me at that pointed and I asked my parents 
if they would buy one for me. Although I was a reasonably bright 5 yr 
old, I found that the cube was really too hard for me at that age. 
The cube then spent the next 5 yrs at the back of the cupboard. I dug 
it out and got back into it when I was about 10 yrs old. At that age 
I was able to start to get an understanding of how it worked. Also, 
my hands were no longer too small to manipulate the cube properly!! I 
worked out F2L by myself, but LL was beyond me at that point so I 
studied other people&#x27;s LL algorithms and within a few months I was 
regularing able to do it in 1.5 mins, with a PB of just under a 
minute. :) I&#x27;d be interested to hear what age&#x27;s other people were 
when they started cubing?

I&#x27;ve tried to encourage my friends to learn so we can race, but I 
think they (i) aren&#x27;t sufficiently interested to put in the time and 
effort required, and (ii) are a bit daunted by seeing me do it in 1 
min (slow by the standards of this group, but quite impressive to 
someone who can&#x27;t even to 1 face).

Re the WC bringing a cube revival down here... From my observations, 
Australians do tend to absorb a lot of American culture (I know 
Toronto is Canada but I talking generally in terms of the Nth 
American continent), but only through movies and TV shows. If 
everyone on Friends and Buffy started cubing then I&#x27;m sure it would 
make a comeback here!!

is the position. Do

U2F2U&#x27;R2U&#x27;R2UF2U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27; (thank you Herbert for this :)),

look at the R face, and then notice that after you do the commutator 
BRB&#x27;R&#x27;, you get the same position on the B face.

Now, what other positions in the LL are so easily &quot;transferable&quot; to 
a different face using a short sequence of moves as that commutator?

          <div class="email-content">this is for those of you who are a little experienced with corners <br>
frist methods.  Which of these would be better (faster)...<br>
<br>
     #1). To orient all corners first, then permute them all in one <br>
alg.<br>
<br>
     #2). To orient and permute 4 corners (lets say white), then <br>
orient the yellow corners then permute them?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i&#x27;ve been playing around with corners first for a couple days, I <br>
don&#x27;t have any plans to really speed cube with it though.  It would <br>
just be nice to get it under a minute once or twice......(using the <br>
first situation, using notes 62 seconds is my fastest :D )<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, this is pretty much why. The airfare alone would be a few 
thousand (Australia) dollars and if you do the maths with the 
exchange rate... I think you get the picture!!

I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d actually want to compete because my times are 
too slow (although there is a year between now and then...), but it 
sounds like it will be heaps of fun and lots of interesting people to 
meet and lots more to learn!

I assume there will be regular updates on the WC site re what happens 
each day next August??

Start betting people $5 that you can do the cube in under 1 minute (or<br>
$10 you can go under 40 seconds) and I bet in a couple of months you&#x27;ll<br>
have enough for a nice trip to the greatest country in the world.<br>

&gt;   I agree that the WC next year will probably resurrect some cube<br>

   So, I&#x27;ve been using this same cube for nearly a year now and it <br>
has treated me a well. But I&#x27;ve noticed that it starts &quot;chirping&quot; <br>
much like the chirps one hears late at night trying to memorize the <br>
orientation cases. Has anyone else noticed this? It&#x27;s definitely <br>
something to do with the spring mechanism. Sometimes when I do <br>
my &quot;ultra-lube&quot; sessions where I take it all apart, wash it, dry the <br>
pieces, lube each piece, dry it, put it together and play with it for <br>
a few days acheiving ultimate lub-ed-ness, the chirping stops. Then <br>
after about a month when the lube starts to fade, the chirping comes <br>
back. If any of you have noticed this, let me know. Is there any way <br>
to fix it? Am I using a weird cube? (I use one I bought from Toys R&#x27; <br>
Us in USA. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same as the Oddzon. The Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube logo on the white face has color, and the picture I&#x27;ve seen of <br>
Oddzon&#x27;s cube logo is just black and white.) Any thoughts?<br>

I figured so.  I think that I like the first way better.  I didnt 
like it at first because it uses new algs for me, but after working 
on them a little bit I found they were pretty simple to learn (as are 
pretty much all of the algs for the whole corners first method im 
trying out).

I don&#x27;t think im really cut out for a corners first method though, 
because of all the slice moves you use.  Im not all that great with 
slice moves :( ........

I did manage to break a minute with the corners first 
method...without notes even!...54 seconds....i think im going to 
learn the rest of my algs for the 2 look LL for my speedcuing, then 
go into a little more detail with the corners first :)

Totally different.  Hey, I did an average w/ the corners first method 
and it turned out to be 61.4 seconds..with a pb of 51. I still dont 
know a few of the algs that go along with it, so sometimes i have to 
do a step or two twice :)...i&#x27;d say thats not too awful bad for 
seeing the method for the first time 2 days ago!

Thats pretty much how I see it too.  

I&#x27;ve worked too hard on my method to just drop it too, but who says 
you would have to drop it.  Why not work the two together?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been trying to download Lars&#x27; video for the last few days using <br>
different URLs, different browsers, different computers and different <br>
applications but without much luck... until now! Now I can finally <br>
see it for myself!<br>
<br>
Lars, while watching the clip I noticed that you just use the ends of <br>
your fingers when speedcubing. I realised that I hold and twist the <br>
cube differently. Much more of my palm comes into contact with the <br>
cube when I&#x27;m solving, especially the part of my palm near my thumb. <br>
For example, when turning the right hand slice with my right hand my <br>
my thumb and the bit of palm it&#x27;s connected to is kinda sitting along <br>
the edge of the right column of the front face. Basically, my <br>
hands &#x27;hug&#x27; (can&#x27;t think of a better word at the moment) the cube <br>
more closely.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m thinking that this is slowing down my times because it means I <br>
have to change hand positions quite frequently, and it&#x27;s also making <br>
it hard for me to learn finger tricks &#x27;cos my hands aren&#x27;t used to <br>
just using the ends of my fingers.<br>
<br>
I shall have to experiment with this. My hands are much smaller which <br>
might make it difficult but I&#x27;m curious to see if changing techniques <br>
will (by itself) have a noticeable difference on my times.<br>

I wonder ... would we get faster times, and better records, with a cube that <br>
was slightly smaller?  My cube is 55x55x55mm: is that standard?  Has anyone <br>
made a cube that is 50x50x50, or even 45x45x45?  Would they be better for <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
I am back from a great vacation, and all new records have been <br>
updated.<br>
Welcome to all new members. This forum has been very busy lately, so <br>
I had to read a lot of new messages. Great!<br>
<br>
Here are some holiday quotes:<br>
I was solving different puzzles at the pool side to get used to <br>
people watching me while solving. And indeed many people are <br>
interested and watch you. The younger kids are amazed about the <br>
cube: &quot;Wow, it moves!&quot;, &quot;What a nice colorful toy!&quot;, &quot;What can you do <br>
with that block?&quot;. The grown-ups: &quot;Does that stupid thing still <br>
exist?&quot;, &quot;Man, you are old-fashioned&quot;, &quot;Are you some kind of <br>
exhibitionist?&quot;, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that thing make you nervous? You should <br>
relax here!&quot;, &quot;Can you solve it?&quot; (this one was after I had solved <br>
cubes for 30 minutes).<br>
I was solving the 5x5x5, and did a reasonable 4 minutes or so, then <br>
this wise guy came and said: &quot;Pfff, you are slow! I could do that one <br>
in 1 minute each time&quot;. I took my 3x3x3 and said: &quot;I think you meant <br>
this one. But since you are that fast, I will scramble it, and see <br>
how fast you really are.&quot;. He walked away saying that he forgot all <br>
his tricks. Later he came back to try the 5x5x5, but he came nowhere <br>
close to solving one side.<br>
<br>
Btw. they had the tiled Chinese 3x3x3 cubes in some kind of surprise <br>
gumball machine. Price was $1.<br>
<br>
Have fun! See you all in the chatroom during the weekends.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Smaller cubes certainly do exist. I&#x27;ve had fully moveable cubes in 
several sizes from about 25x25x25mm (a keyring cube!) up to, and 
beyond, the standard size. Problem is that I don&#x27;t quite know where 
they are now. When I moved out I only took my main racing cube, my 
sparkly cube and square-1. My other 20+ Rubik&#x27;s cubes + puzzles are 
probably buried somewhere in a cupboard at my parent&#x27;s house. Maybe 
I&#x27;ll search for a few next time I visit.

          <div class="email-content">  Yea.  You said 20 cubes?  Dang, I only have one lol.  The smaller 
cubes might be better for finger tricks, but I think there are 
regulations to the cube&#x27;s size for the championships so it would be 
more or less for your own amusement.  Even still, it sounds really 
kewl.

I&#x27;m not sure, but most girls I&#x27;ve talked to say that size doesn&#x27;t 
matter.

All I know is that the 2x2x2&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s solution&quot; is 11 moves long in 
its worst mixed-ness. Don&#x27;t know about the others.

Well, it all depends on the metric you use. For the 2x2x2 with 
quarter turn metric it is 14. With half turn metric it is 11. It 
isn&#x27;t actually known for the 3x3x3 - there are just suspicions and 
known bounds but the exact figure isn&#x27;t known.
Upper bounds should be easy enough to calculate for any cube and 
some lower bounds too but the intervals may be large.
The fact that the cubes of size >3 don&#x27;t form a group (at least in 
terms of identifying positions that look the same - you&#x27;d have to 
mark the centres in some way to rectify this) probably makes the 
analysis harder.

Needless to say, you assumed that OLL practices while seeing only the <br>

<br>
The page of OLL 2-face look page is very difficult contents.  <br>
You need to learn the differences of 167 appearances. <br>
If you are able to master the contents of this page your OLL will <br>
evolve very much. <br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt;OK, the easiest thing will be to show the answer to the puzzle. Here<br>
&gt;is the position. Do<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;U2F2U&#x27;R2U&#x27;R2UF2U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27; (thank you Herbert for this :)),<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;look at the R face, and then notice that after you do the commutator<br>
&gt;BRB&#x27;R&#x27;, you get the same position on the B face.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Now, what other positions in the LL are so easily &quot;transferable&quot; to<br>
&gt;a different face using a short sequence of moves as that commutator?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
OK I have had a look, it seems that there is just one other (L&#x27;U&#x27;LU), but <br>
this is only the trivial reflection of the position you have already given.<br>
<br>
There are only 4 2-move commutators (any other can be expressed as one of <br>
these plus an initial cube rotation):<br>
1) + 2): LUL&#x27;U&#x27; and L&#x27;U&#x27;LU<br>
3) + 4): LU&#x27;L&#x27;U and L&#x27;ULU&#x27;<br>
<br>
Commutators 1) and, effectively, 2) are solved. (In fact I have presumed 2) <br>
works without testing it, but surely yes.)<br>
<br>
You can prove that the LU&#x27;L&#x27;U/L&#x27;ULU&#x27; pair is not possible, because:<br>
(a) the commutator only affects three edges (a corner, and the three <br>
corner/edge pairs that radiate from it), and<br>
(b) by restricting the pattern to the ll you need to have one of the three <br>
affected corner/edge pairs solved before performing the commutator, and a <br>
different corner/edge pair (target corner/edge pair) solved after running <br>
the commutator, and<br>
(c) you have no choice over which of the three available corner/edge pairs <br>
the target corner/edge pair needs to be: the corner of this corner/edge pair <br>
has to be the one from the very centre of the 3 affected faces, because with <br>
any of the others three corners it, together with its matching edge, are not <br>
touching each other and so split between two faces: this results in three <br>
unsolved edge/pairs, thus breaking out of the ll, BUT:<br>
if you do use this central corner and its edge, the two remaining edges get <br>
flipped by the commutator, resulting in a different cube pattern.<br>
<br>
So it seems to me that it cannot be done.  Now I just *know* someone is <br>
going to prove me wrong!<br>

astounded I don&#x27;t hear more about it. Jess, if you&#x27;re on here, thanks <br>
for a great site!! Not only does he have a great collection of <br>
solving-videos, but also video of his finger tricks for ALL of the <br>
Fridrich-algs, if not, more. I also commend Jess for what seems to be <br>
a very elequent twisting style. I&#x27;m not sure how many of you are like <br>
this, but from all the videos I&#x27;ve seen of him, his twisting has an <br>
almost mechanical fluidity. If you&#x27;re on here, pray tell what cube <br>
you use, and if that has made a difference for you!<br>
   Also, www.rubikscuberecord.com. Videos. Speechless.<br>

I recently bought a meffert cube because I wanted a cube with
tiles instead of stickers that was reasonably smooth turning.
The cube was very easy to turn out of the box, but after 
about 30 solutions, became much too loose (without lubing).  The cube
now
overturns, which is impossible to compensate for since
there is no spring action.  See David Knight&#x27;s page for 
more info in this regard:
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#whereget

My best time on that cube was about 3min30sec; when I realized that it
would be very difficult to progress on that cube, I started buying 
rubiks.com cubes, which were easy to break in and have very nice
spring action.
Of course, there are the stickers, but I may follow Knight&#x27;s advise
and just
transfer the tiles from the meffert cube to the rubik.com cube.
I&#x27;ve yet to lube the cubes but have seen my average 10 rep time go
down to 
2min06sec, with a non-cheat personal best of 1min44sec using the
rubiks.com
&quot;new solution&quot;.  After i reach 1:30, I will start learning faster
algorithms
like the ll and/or f2l.

Wish me luck and happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">Yeah - the assembly cubes do move very nicely from the start, but 
they tend to be too unforgiving, making any real speed difficult 
(especially finger tricks)... I&#x27;ve also experienced the overturning 
you mentioned; very difficult to work with...

Regarding tiles vs. stickers, you can actually buy a set of tiles 
from Mefferts for $2 or $3 (I don&#x27;t remember how much, off hand)... 
They don&#x27;t have an actual item in their store (at least didn&#x27;t 
before), but if you contact them, they can give you instructions on 
purchasing a set of tiles (if they get back to you - I&#x27;m currently 
waiting for an e-mail response from them on another issue)...

I actually know some of these for once!

R&#x27;F&#x27;L&#x27;FRF&#x27;LF can be used for 2 diagonally opposite (with the common 
colour on the B face (for the UBR corner) and the L face (for the 
UFL corner).

R&#x27;F&#x27;LFRF&#x27;L&#x27;F can be used for 2 adjacent (with the common colour on 
opposite faces) (the B and F faces)

R2D&#x27;RU2R&#x27;DRU2R can be used for 2 adjacent (with the common colour on 
the same face) (the B face)

Alternatively you can use the move that you use to twist 3 corners 
more than once:

I make it that you&#x27;d need to use it 3 times.

The first time you need to twist two of the correct corners and one 
of the others (*) (a bit of experimentation will let you see which; 
basically you need to finish up needing to twist 4 corners).
Then there&#x27;ll be 4 corners needing twisting 2 of each type. Twist 
both of the type that was twisted (*) and one of the others.
That should leave you with 3 corners left to twist, if my 
calculations are correct.

Here&#x27;s a summary:

Number of twists needed:
2 1 0 0 (the 2 and 1 need not be adjacent in the real cube)
Twist the corners indicated:
1 0 1 1
To leave:
1 1 2 2
Twist the corners indicated:
1 0 1 1
To leave:
0 1 1 1
Twist the corners indicated:
0 1 1 1
To leave:
0 0 0 0
Now you should be done.

S.
If you havn&#x27;t tried it yet it must mean you are not practising 
enough!  Either that or the last time you lubed you just dropped your

Not sure which technique you are using. If you are reading it from 
my page it works like this:

the U &amp; D faces have highest priority and the R &amp; L faces have least 
priority (so the F &amp; B faces have middle priority).

Now every edge has colours from two faces and the colours are from 
different faces which are not opposite (so one colour of the edge 
will have higher priority than the other). For instance, the UF edge 
has a high priority colour (corresponding to the colour of the U 
face) and a middle priority colour corresponding to the colour of 
the F face.
Each edge lies in 2 faces. These faces also have different 
priorities, one higher than the other.
If the higher priority colour lies in the higher priority face then 
the edge has good orientation (0). Otherwise it has bad orientation 
(1).

So if the UF edge is in the BR position it has orientation 0 if the 
U colour is on the B face (because U is the higher priority of U and 
F and B is the higher priority of B and R) and has orientation 1 if 
the U colour is on the R face.

Similarly if the BL edge is in the DR position it will have 
orientation 0 if the B colour is on the D face and orientation 1 if 
the B colour is on the R face.

Whenever the the U or D colour of an edge is in the R or L face that 
edge has orientation 1. Whenever the R or L colour of an edge is in 
the U or D face that edge has orientation 1.

Whenever the the U or D colour of an edge is in the U or D face that 
edge has orientation 0. Whenever the R or L colour of an edge is in 
the R or L face that edge has orientation 0.

This is a good reason to always choose the same colours as the U 
face and the F face which is something I virtually always do) - I 
use white and green respectively - as it saves a lot of thought in 
figuring out the orientation of each piece.

The total number of edges of orientation 0 (or equivalently of 
orientation 1) should be even. If it&#x27;s not you have to dismantle the 
cube to solve it. If someone has tampered with the cube it is 
possible to detect this and go ahead and solve it anyway and at the 
last moment take out an edge and flip it (or twist an edge or 
whatever needs to be done) before putting the cube down and removing 
the blindfold. This should amaze the tamperer yet further.

Hope this helps. If not I can try to make the post less confusing.

I use Lars method but only know the moves you must know to solve the cube + four extra moves.
Last layer is usually quite fast but first two is quite slow since I want to put pices in the same way all the time instead to adopt to the specific possition.

My best time is 52s and I get less than 80s all the time. Average would be 65-70s I think.

if you use the Petrus method then the odds are alot better than 
1/216, because your always going to have the edges 
oriented....correct?

          <div class="email-content">Lars Petrus would probably be one of the best helps here...<br>
<br>
Im putting together all the cases/algs for my F2l...as most of you <br>
know I use a modified Petrus method...(Petrus/Fridrich hybrid)...<br>
<br>
when expanding to the 2x2x3, what I do is do that first corner/edge <br>
pair, then do the first layer edge.  Well, I got all the possible <br>
cases for corner edge pairs figured out with algs..(this doesnt <br>
include when pieces are in either the wrong slot on the middle layer, <br>
or wrong slot on the first layer)...I came up with 37 cases.  The <br>
reason there are more cases for mine VS the Fridrich f2l (22) is <br>
because the reflections can&#x27;t always  be performed as reflected <br>
algs.  <br>
<br>
and well my quetion is, it worth it to learn the alg. to put my <br>
corner edge pair in, AND then learn another alg for the same corner <br>
edge pair that would preserve next first layer edge if it happened to <br>
be in place....the algs that preserve the edge are 1 or 2 moves <br>
longer than the one that wouldnt preserve the edge.  So what should i <br>
do...<br>
<br>
1. learn 2 algs for the same case, 1 to preserve the edge, and <br>
another thats a couple moves shorter that doesnt preserve the edge...<br>
(on some of the cases the shorter alg, does preserve the edge, so i <br>
wouldn&#x27;t have to learn 2 algs for ALL the cases)...<br>
<br>
2. just learn the shorter alg. and dont worry about preserving the <br>
edge...then use another 3 or 4 moves for the edge...<br>
<br>
3. Learn just the algs that preserve the edge for each case...these <br>
will be a couple moves longer...<br>
<br>
<br>
then im going to be in the same deal for my next corner edge <br>
pair...which on most im going to have to use different algs than the <br>
37 that i already went through (this one having about 37 algs <br>
too) ...THEN theres going to be the 22 algs for the final corner edge <br>
pari...phew..<br>
<br>
that is alot of algs for just the f2l, but they are more like <br>
intuition ya know...and i think quite a bit of them are going to be <br>
the same alg. the different corner/edge pairs...<br>
<br>
<br>
well, what do you guys think??<br>

thanks<br>

<br>
I can complete the cube trying about 1.30 mins. Now I am  learning to <br>
speed things up. So I found some resources on the net.<br>
<br>
This is the site I am currently refering to. <br>
<br>
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html<br>
<br>
This page has permutations for the last layer.<br>
<br>
Now the problem is, when I match the pattern and try to apply the <br>
algorithm the whole cube gets screwed up. ( for example If I want to <br>
move the last layer 3 middle cubes clock wise I use the algorithm<br>
R²U Fs R²Bs U R² = R²U FB&#x27; R²BF&#x27; U R² )<br>
<br>
now once I moved that I can nicely jumbled my cube :(<br>
<br>
What am I doing wrong here ?<br>
<br>
When I do the move I turn the cube so the last layer is the top layer.<br>
<br>
please help!!!<br>
<br>
Also some notations like<br>

well if only that one layer was messed up, then its because your not 
holding it right, but since the whole cube is messed up then your 
turning something wrong....tripple check that your turning stuff the 
right direction, and just to make sure, F= front, B= back, R=right, 
L= left , D= down (bottom layer) and U= up (top layer).....

hope that helps...

ps....man it seems like every messes up the algs when they start 
out...I know I did at first, and its the same with some people i&#x27;ve 
helped figure it out....so your NOT alone..haha

As for what algs to learn, my philosophy is to start with the most 
common ones. Or more precisely the ones that will earn you the most 
number of moves on average. One that would save you 10 moves 1% of 
the time is less important than one that saves you 3 moves10% of the

It will be a case of more and more diminishing returns.

Which of 1, 2 or 3 to pick depends entirely on the frequence of each 
case, and how much you gain by learning each one.

I dont mean expanding from the 2x2x3, im talking about that first 
corner edge pair right after the 2x2x2 corner is made.....its like on 
your site, you say it took you months to figure out the little simple 
moves, acutally someone you taught showed them to you....i think 
we&#x27;re talkin about the same moves for that first pair.

for me expanding to the 2x2x3 block is adding a corner edge pair + a 
top layer edge....(i do the f2l on the top two layers, and i always 
go around the cube to the right...by going around the cube, i mean 
that first corner/edge pair is to the right of my 2x2x2 corner, and 
then my next thing to place is to the right of that.....

i go like this.. 2x2x2 corner, corner/edge pair, top edge, 
corner/edge pair, last top edge, last corner/edge pair...

so you suggest not doing either 1, 2 or 3 but to do each case 
differently by how much it will gain me?

thanks

          <div class="email-content">Oh, OK, I get it now. And I get why you thought I could answer :)

I also do thing in that order. Unless I see some better option. That 
happens perhaps 1/3 of the time.

I&#x27;m surprised to hear there are only 37 positions. I don&#x27;t 
consciously know any of them, though I&#x27;m sure I recognize a lot of 
them instantly. I just look at it and &quot;understand&quot;. I&#x27;m not that much 
into learning a lot of algorithms. That&#x27;s just a personal preference, 
and I&#x27;m sure you can get better than me at my method if you memorize 
a ton of algs.

The thing with this step is that you have three corners to choose to 
expand to. That means that being able to see which of the three 
options is the best (fast!) is just as important as knowing how to 
solve them. It also means that you don&#x27;t need to learn any 
unfortunate cases. All you need to learn is to recognize them and 
pick an other corner for the expansion!(*) If you once in a 100 
solutions happen to get three lousy options, just take that extra 
second or three to sort it out some how. That&#x27;s not worth spending 
valuable brain power on.

It sounds like you always pick one of the three corners, regardless 
of how easy the others are. I realize it may be a really difficult 
habit to break, but it helps a *lot*.

So I think I&#x27;m closest to option 2.

Hope that helps!

/Lars

(*) Come to think of it, that&#x27;s *not* what I do. I look until I find 
a *good* option, and then I do it immediately. If nothing real good 
pops out at first, I lower my demands until I settle for one option.

My stock answer is that if you do &quot;View Source&quot; (or whatever your 
browser calls it) and look at the html, you&#x27;ll find the code for 
applets look like this:

&lt;applet code=lrubik.class width=125 height=145>
&lt;param name=pos value=&quot;ebfeacdcbcafebefcdadcfcbdceaacddfbfebdfaeedacebaffdabb&quot;>
&lt;param name=move 
value=&quot;B2L1D3L3U3F3D1R2U1R3L3B1L2U1L3U1B1U1B1U1B2U3B2U1B1R1D1L3D3R3D1L1D1L2R2U2F1D2L2R2U2&quot;>
&lt;/applet>

The &quot;move value&quot; line should be easy for you to decipher if you 
really find the written notation so useful :-)

Tack för tipset. Kanske provar på det om jag får ett par veckor 
över :-)
Åker buss en timme varje dag, och tycker det är skönt att leka med 
kuben då. Men har lite svårt att få med mig datorn då. Har även 
funderingar på att knåpa ihop dem bästa anvisningarna i PDF format 
till min hemsida så fort jag lyckas knäcka FTP-spärren här på jobbet.
Grattis till nya rekordet förresten!

          <div class="email-content">I find, and think you will find too, if you are right handed, the 
easiest algorithm to execute is R2 D&#x27; U2 R&#x27; L F2 R L&#x27; D R2  These are 
the basic moves and as you practice them more and more you will see 
shortcuts like moving the two layers at the end rather than just the 
one, so you can do it all more or less with your right hand.

To move them anti-clockwise, you can use a similar alg, R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; L F2 
R L&#x27; D U2 R2 (same, but different positioning of the U2 move)

Hope it helps

          <div class="email-content">I have been speedsolving for about 4 months now, and for 3 of those, 
i have been learning and practising the finger tricks and triggers. I 
am still improving my performance with them, it seems to take a lot 
of time to get them moving quickly, for instance, you have to take 
into account the accuracy with which you turn each face, so the cube 
doesnt get stuck, and the grip you have to use. With practice, you 
will see how best to hold the cube, the grip and the angle at which 
you look at it all affect the speed of the trick. I have more or less 
mastered the right hand (it has taken three months :)) and now, I am 
working on my left-hand, which is much more difficult for me, but 
necessary to go faster. I practice maybe a couple of hours each day, 
often more, hopefully having mastered the right-hand it shoudnt take 
as long to work out the left hand ones :D

Lars, have the people you refer to below got websites? Where did they 
post their claims? Please let me know.

Thanks,

btw I seem to have got a touch of rsi (so pay heed to the warnings 
that Jasmine was giving) and am going to have to change my handle to 
one_hand ;) as I can&#x27;t cube with my lefthand anymore.

ps GOD2 what about onehanded blindfold cubing - have you tried that 
yet? Its beyond me, but I guess I can keep working at it. Maybe a 
possible category at the wc?

pps smoothcuber, I promise to rejoin the chatrooms when I get a 
replacement computer for home that actually works, maybe we will have 
to discuss onehanded finger tricks, lol

ppps and before the rumours start, yes the rsi is from too much 
cubing ;)

&quot;Of&quot; not just &quot;O&quot; (otherwise the shorthand is not good).

Haven&#x27;t yet tried it but I will sometime. First I&#x27;m working on doing 
the 3x3x3 and the 4x4x4 simultaneously - been close a few times but 
no result yet.

After that I guess I&#x27;ll try the one-handed blindfold thing.

Also, hopefully I will improve my blindfold technique as I need to 
speed up a bit to keep pace with the top times (as ascertained from 
the UWR page).

Of course, there&#x27;s also the 5x5x5 but I haven&#x27;t got one with me on 
the IOM.

Unfortunately on the screen here the orange and yellow are too 
similar which makes big cubes too hard to practice.

Too bad about your wrist.  I hope it gets better in time.  In the <br>

          <div class="email-content">I just took a look at Gaetan&#x27;s site...  It is a little hard to 
follow, and the English version is incomplete...  It is a corners

he does the edges)...  I don&#x27;t know French, but I looked at the 
French version, and there were images that I could infer were related 
to solving the edges...  As I understand his method, it is a fairly 
standard corners first method that works something like this:
1) Orient 3 corners by inspection (he seems to require for orienting 
the rest that there be a face with exactly three properly oriented)
2) Orient the other 5 corners (he has sequences for all possibilities)
3) Put the corners on their respective faces (U corners on U face, D 
corners on D face)
4) Position all corners together
5) Place 3 U edges
6) Place all D edges
7) Orient other edges
8) Place the other edges

          <div class="email-content">You can find a good explantion for placing the edges on this page: 

http://cube.misto.cz/corners.html

At the bottom you can find algorithms for placing the top and bottom edges and for orienting and permuting the middle layer edges. On the same site you can find 8 algorithms for placing the final U- or D-layer edge and orienting the middle-layer edges simultaneously:

http://cube.misto.cz/_MAIL_/cfsm.html

This only leaves the middle layer to be permuted (which only takes 4 to 6 moves). This is great for saving moves. 

If you&#x27;re also interested in an alternative way of placing the corners in as few moves as possible, I can recommend you Ron&#x27;s algorithms for placing and orienting the final layer corners in one look.

http://www.speedcubing.com/corners_first_corners.html

This averages 8,5 moves and with a bit af practise you can solve the corners in about 17-18 moves (Ron needs 15 moves).

Using this method I can solve the cube corners-first in about 60-65 moves, which is OK considering I only learnt it two weeks ago.

Well, the great thing about lube is that it can be washed out if you think<br>
it&#x27;s become too loose.  There&#x27;s no worries about irreversible damage if you<br>
use silicone.<br>

I remember you mentioning this in an earlier posting. If I did that I 
wouldn&#x27;t have any cubes. I&#x27;ve never found one that&#x27;s worked well 
straight out of the box!

          <div class="email-content">today I made a new best average....I only beat my previous one by .2 <br>
seconds but hey, its goin down :D...new avg is 28.6<br>
<br>
its almost crazy how many times i&#x27;ve hit 22 the past couple days....I <br>
cant remember the last time I got that low except for the last 3 or 4 <br>
days<br>
<br>
I guess the reason I was gettin my low times (22 and such) was <br>
because I was just movin right along through both the f2l and the <br>
LL...but last night and the first average I did today it seemed like <br>
my f2l was taking forever...somethin like around 20 seconds or a <br>
little more....and with a good LL I would still get under 30, but <br>
with a &quot;not so good&quot; (and a really bad f2l) my times would be <br>
anywhere from low to high 30s.<br>
<br>
I finally got all the 2 look algs learned Friday or so, and so now im <br>
using a straight 2 look for the LL.....but a few of them still take <br>
too long to recognize and the moves aren&#x27;t quite fast enough yet...I <br>
just need to practice them a lil more I guess...(that would usually <br>
be where the &quot;not so good&quot; LL comes in...haha<br>
<br>
Im still tryin to figure out just how im gonna start improving my <br>
F2L, so I havn&#x27;t really started improving it yet..(any tips would be <br>
greatly appreciated...please refer to my &quot;a little advice&quot; post) haha<br>

alot of the reason for this post was that I couldn&#x27;t think of <br>

It seems like everyone here is better at cubing than me.. My average 
is about 50-55 seconds, and my personal best is 43. Fortunately, I 
just learned five or six new algorithms that should cut 5 or ten 
seconds off of my time. What way do you solve it?

I´ll try it when I get some free time.
Are you guys realy 12 and 13 years old?! Damn! When I was 12 I 
couldn´t even concentrate long enough to START concentrating on 
solving more than one side! It´s like they say, &quot;you live and learn&quot; 
and &quot;times change&quot;.
I´m thinking of collecting all the guides I find usefull and convert 
them into Acrobate format (*.pdf), and post them on my own site. 
Might contact you again and ask for permision to do that.

I heard of one guy that was learning the 1211 algs too.  But he quickly<br>
found that the thinking time to select the correct alg was very high.  So,<br>
it&#x27;s not just the effort involved in learning them all, it&#x27;s practicing<br>

It sure would take time for me!  I do a one at a time F2L and a 4 stage LL<br>
and I still take too long to think!  If you saw a video of me, it would be<br>
like the cubing version of swiss cheese!  Still, an average of 35 these days<br>
is good going for such a basic system.<br>

I just can&#x27;t comprehend how it can be done!  I don&#x27;t know if some of the<br>
1211 cases are rarer than others, but even if they&#x27;re all even chances,<br>

anybody who has the LL down to 2 looks would know 53 alg for the 
LL...unless of course you use a different 2 look method than orient 
all, permute all.

I don&#x27;t know anything like 53 algorithms for the LL (and probably 
not for the entire cube) for the LL but I can do the entire cube in 
1 look and the method I use in that case is orient all, permute all.

correct....but what im saying is that those 53 algs are going to be 
included in the 1211.....i think it would be kinda pointless to be 
able to recognize which OLL positions would be lucky enough to 
permute also...

That&#x27;s OK!  The funny thing is, I can just imagine someone sitting somewhere <br>
in a basement (yes, definitely a basesment) with a printout of all 1211 <br>
algs.  Quitely, stealthily, this faceless person, perhaps with some grudge <br>
against the world in general, grimly works through the list, ticking them <br>
off as they are recorded in a cold, mechanical mind.  Each day the person <br>
awakes and reaches for the cube, driven by one goal: &quot;The WORLD <br>
CHAMPIONSHIPS will be mine!  Haaahaaa ....&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahem, excuse all, just letting my imagination get the better of me.  Back to <br>
those OLL algorithms.  53 out of 1211 will do for me.<br>
S.<br>
BUT ... is there anyone out there with more than 53?<br>

When you say 53, are you referring to the 57 cases on this page?

http://home01.wxs.nl/~janse625/AllesFastOrient.html

Sometimes when I am solving orientation cases where the corners are 
correctly oriented and positioned, but two edges are flipped, I can 
figure out a move that will solve the last layer in one step, but 
this situation doesn&#x27;t come up very often.

I think if everyone has the attitude that they will &quot;only go to the 
championships if they think they can win&quot; then theres going to be a 
lot of people that do not go.  Remember, its not all about the 
speed...there are LOTS of other categories and puzzles...plus one of 
the kewlest thing about going would be the chance to meet everyone

          <div class="email-content">53 is the total number of algorithms modulo symmetry needed to 
complete the last layer in two algorithms using the Fridrich method
(40 for the orientation and 13 for the permutation). The number 57 
you guys are talking about is the number of possible orientation 
cases (without the solved one) including symmetric positions. 
Counting it this way, there&#x27;s 78 algorithms needed to completely 
solve the last layer. But then, the 1211 cases go up to ???.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, but then there&#x27;s the money issue; I live in Idaho, and I&#x27;m 
thirteen, therefore too young to get a job. My parents won&#x27;t even let 
me get a paper route(I don&#x27;t know why).
And the cubes last time were brand new and un-lubed, and you didn&#x27;t 
get to choose the color orientation(red across from orange, blue 
across from green, etc.). Which must have made a large difference on 
the time. But this time, people get to use their own cubes. If I do 
go, I&#x27;ll probably win the Youngest Person to Solve the 
Cube award, if there is one.
Did you say there are roller coasters???

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s what I was thinking of. Go to the mall with your cube and have 
the people mix it up, then you solve it in less than a minute. LOL
I don&#x27;t know how to get a sponsor either. I&#x27;m going to try to get an 
average in the mid-forties before I sign up. Do you know when the 
signing up closes?

          <div class="email-content">signing up doesnt close...the way I understand it is you can just <br>
walk into the contest and have a go at it....<br>
<br>
that is a pretty good idea to raise money to get to the <br>
contest...lol...<br>
<br>
maybe just stand on the street corner with a sign saying...&quot;send me <br>
to Toronto to the Rubiks Cube World Championships&quot;..and have a <br>
suitcase under the sign where people can toss money in...and all you <br>
have to do is solve the cube :)....OR...bet people 50 bucks that you <br>
can solve it...and if people bet ya, then you&#x27;ll have enough money to <br>
go in no time....<br>

<br>
Our club member Smoothcuber (Dave) is now among world&#x27;s best having <br>
solved 3 cubes blindfolded. Impressive stuff. Cheers!!!!!<br>

Dave, now that you can do 3, it must also be possible to be the <br>
world&#x27;s best by solving 4! Good luck. Richard, be warned ;-)<br>

Btw. according to http://www.rubiks.com/rubiksnews.html Hessport is <br>

Good stuff.

Last night I achieved the 3x3x3 and the 4x4x4 in a simultaneous 
blindfold which was my current goal so maybe I can go for 4 cubes 
next.

This isn&#x27;t related to the subject but is the most recent post of 
smoothcuber&#x27;s I could find.

Well done on 3 cubes.

Out of curiosity do you have your own technique or do you use a 
technique like stiffhands&#x27; or mine?

I&#x27;m going to try and work some improvements into my method soon, 
which will hopefully help facilitate faster solving.

Have you tried the Revenge yet?

          <div class="email-content">I think you are looking for this move:

r2 B2 U2 l U2 r &#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l &#x27; B2 r2

(lower case r and l refer to the inner slices next to R and L.)  This 
will swap two edge cubies on the UF edge.

I found that move here: http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-step3.html

This is a parity problem that arises because you can cycle 3 pieces, 
but you can&#x27;t truly swap two pieces.  My guess is that the above 
sequence disturbs some identically colored face pieces, but I haven&#x27;t 
checked for sure.  Before I figured out that move, I used to solve it 
by doing a quarter turn of an inner slice (like r) which would move 4 
edge pieces in a way that you can&#x27;t move them with 3-cycles.  Then, I 
would move the pieces back with 3-cycles, which would be possible 
because of the two extra pieces that needed swapping.  The 
disadvantage of this method is that it messed up a lot of center 
pieces.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I often take a cube to school with me, so I can do it at lunch. Two<br>
&gt; of my friends can do it too, and they bring one with them too. People<br>
&gt; are amazed at us. :)<br>
&gt; I  wish I had a MegaMinx. It sounds hard.. I can&#x27;t even figure out a<br>
&gt; 4x4x4 cube.<br>
&gt; By the way, is it just me, or do people in this group use periods<br>
&gt; alot.......?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey, I only decided to learn the 4x4x4 a couple of weeks ago.  It only took<br>
one sitting with Chris Hardwicks page.  I had it down in an evening!  If you<br>
know how to do a 3x3x3 then there are hardly any new algs to learn.  You can<br>
do all the centres by intuition alone and you can do the edges with only one<br>
alg to learn.  Hopefully from there you solve it just as the 3x3x3 but<br>
usually you have to apply one or two parity fixing algs.<br>
<br>
I have a mega minx but I&#x27;m scared to scramble it.  I keep studying it,<br>
trying to figure out if I can apply what I already know to it.  One thing<br>
scares me is that there are two of every edge colour combination.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all you cubers! Im a new member to this group (or any Yahoo group for that matter). I&#x27;m 14 years old and have been cubing for... um... 3 months. I&#x27;m obsessed with cubing as Im sure most of you are. My PB is 46 secs, but Ive done better without timing it (figures). My average is rather slower then those who are faster (I think Im about 56 secs). I use a layer by layer f2l (Wich I really dont like) and a 3 look LL (except for a few situations where I use a 4 look because I dont know the 3 look). I plan on learning the rest of the 3 looks and then learning a totally new f2l method. I already failed at the Petrus method. I dont think my brain works that way. Im strongly considering Jessica&#x27;s method. Atleast now I can get some help from people who already use the method. Im happy to be apart of this group. Lookin foward to seeing you all at the worlds if I bring my time down and my parents decide to love me:)<br>

Yes, it is on the web -it&#x27;s even in the bookmarks (although not 
directly) as it is currently hosted by Jessica Fridrich.

I originally had thought about a similar technique as it seemed to 
make more sense mathematically but I rejected it as being too hard 
compared to the method I currently use.
Afterwards I saw stiff_hands&#x27; page and I still think that it is 
probably too hard. : )

That&#x27;s the best place to start - or else flip the edges. Orienting 
pieces first is the best way.

not a bad idea, excapt I go to a really small school....(last year 
there was a whole 16 people in my entire class..thats the whole 
junior class)......my class is the smallest in the school though...

most the people in school know I cube anyway....and some are pretty 
interested in it...some have bought cubes but can&#x27;t quite solve 
it...so thats why im thinkin this year I can get a few of them to 
solve it. :D

I use corners first.  Right now I have a personal best average of 
27.8 and I can tell that my average can still go down much further.  
I used the algorithms from the wonderful site www.speedcubing.com 
check it out.

Yeah, but (s)he&#x27;s probably talking about without having any 
preinspection.

You blindfold someone, then scramble the cube and they will find it 
very difficult to solve it.

I know I could get the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 online, but I&#x27;ve seen so many 
dodgy cubes over the years that I&#x27;m skeptical about a cube I can&#x27;t 
try before buying, let alone one I haven&#x27;t even seen!!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve started using a Lars/Jessica/other method. I had a go at Lars&#x27; <br>
F2L method, and although I could do it, for some reason it wasn&#x27;t <br>
really connecting well with the cube part of my brain. So, I had a <br>
look at Jessica&#x27;s F2L method, not so much for specific algorithms, <br>
more just for the concept, ie. do the cross, the insert top <br>
corner/middle edges. I found that seemed to fit more naturally with <br>
the way I think about the cube. As for the LL, I&#x27;m using several <br>
Lars&#x27; algorithms which I learnt a while ago and a couple of others <br>
that I learnt years ago.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point is that I was looking for a way to improve my <br>
understanding of the cube - not really focusing on speed at the <br>
moment but on understanding what each twist does to the cube rather <br>
than just blinding applying algorithms. I&#x27;m hoping that a better <br>
understanding of how the cube works will mean that I can be more <br>
intuitive and efficient in solving and faster at identifying the best <br>
options.<br>

I think one of the best ways to improve your understanding of the 
cube is to do it slow, and try to find shorter move sequences to do 
what you wanna do :D

It very much depends on your system of memorization. With the system 
I use you have to memorize about 35 numbers although in practice you 
remember about 40 numbers (it&#x27;s possible to save 5 numbers if you 
really want because you don&#x27;t have to remember any of the details 
for the last edge or corner, saving 4 numbers, and you can also 
remember just the orientation of either the penultimate edge or the 
penultimate corner (but not both).

For a Revenge you need to remember about 40 numbers and 24 letters 
but it&#x27;s actually harder than learning 2 cubes because everything is 
intertwined whereas with 2 cubes you have disjoint puzzles to work 
on.

The main thing is to know or be able to work out exactly the 
position and orienation of every piece before you start or else it&#x27;s 
very unlikely to end up a successful endeavour.

In practice you should try and figure out pairs of edges that you 
might flip together (instead of remembering a sequence of 12 0&#x27;s and 
1&#x27;s) and similarly for corners.

Make very sure that you know the permutations particularly well 
because you should orient the pieces first. (If not, you need to 
carry extra information around with you, or at least memorize it in 
a different order, which is more difficult to work out from just 
looking at the cube.)

As for memorizing sequences of numbers, I often just try to remember 
the numbers as numbers but there are things you might do instead: 
for instance you could associate events to pairs of numbers like 
Tokyo to 68 (since the Tokyo Olympics were in 1968) or New York to 2 
12 since the area code for Manhattan is 212 etc.

Once you find something that seems to work it&#x27;s just a question of 
having a good memory and also being able to switch stuff in your 
mind quickly.

Last night for instance (at about 3am of all crazy times) I had a 
first attempt at doing 4 cubes blindfolded simultaneously - 3am was 
the start time for solving the cubes, memorization had taken place 
earlier - then I&#x27;d had a bit of a break and watched a couple of 
films, then I completed memorizing the cubes - having not memorized 
teh edge permutation of the 4th cube - and then I spent a fair bit 
of time checking everything was in place in my mind. On each cube I 
oriented every piece correctly and permuted the edges correctly and 
on the first, third and fourth cubes I permuted the corners 
correctly too, but on the second cube I only permuted the bottom 
corners correctly and was left with a corner permutation starting 3 
4 1 2 instead of 1 2 3 4. This was actually due to a lapse of 
concentration and I was able to figure out exactly where I had gone 
wrong, namely after getting the D face corners into position I just 
completely forgot to permute the corners in the U face. Had the 
corner permutation been odd instead of even I would no doubt have 
realized this when it came to finishing up the edges but unluckily 
that was not the case and when I removed the blindfold (about 
4.05am) and realized what had happened I was left to rue my costly 
error.

I was still able to recall the initial positions of each of the 4 
cubes so I figure I&#x27;m probably in good shape to have another crack 
at it soon.

It is at least something that gives hope for a future crack at the 
5x5x5.

Anyway the best advice is to spend as much time as you need to take 
in the information and not to rush things. It&#x27;s only 40 numbers to 
remember so it&#x27;s not any more difficult than remembering 6 telephone 
numbers (except that usually you wouldn&#x27;t have to start messing 
around with them in your head).

Another tip (as I mentioned above) is to orient the pieces first. 
Unless, like me, you try to remember the initial positions for 
afterwards so that you can make a record of the cubes you have 
solved blindfolded, this will allow you to completely forget the 
orientation information relatively early on in the solution.

Also, if you place the last 4 edges first (in the permutation stage) 
it may help you in terms of not having to memorize as much for as 
long (although in practice it may be better to place edges as the 
situation dictates).

Finally remember that it is a lot easier than it sounds. After 
you&#x27;ve solved the cube blindfolded a few times you&#x27;ll wonder why you 
ever thought it might be difficult.

The short answer seems to be that temporarily at least there is no 
solution to the problem:

http://www.microsoft.com/java/xp.htm

You can download java from Sun (and get oinkleburger to work for 
instance) but it won&#x27;t help you to chat as that&#x27;ll ask for virtual 
machine and Sun won&#x27;t let MS distribute that anymore (copyright 
issues).

Try to get a book on group theory and look at permutation groups. A 
lot of useful stuff can be obtained from that. In particular, you 
may find out why so many moves involve conjugation or commutators. 
Also some of the best known solutions (in terms of number of moves) 
are based on group theory, using the Jordan-Holder theorem to 
descend through a sequence of normal subgroups to solve the cube.

You can have both you know - maybe try to get your 
girlfriend/boyfriend interested in cubing?

I think there is a fundamental difference between the way the male brain<br>
works and the female brain.  I could limit cubing to one hour a week and I&#x27;d<br>
still be accused of neglect.<br>

&gt; I think one of the best ways to improve your understanding of the <br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I&#x27;m also all for correct spelling and grammar online, but 
exaggerated punctuation and correct punctuation are not necessarily 
mutually exclusive. For example:

&quot;Rubik&#x27;s cubes are fun to solve!&quot;
&quot;Rubik&#x27;s cubes are fun to solve!!&quot;

Both sentences express excitement about cube solving, the second one 
is just more animated (--> body language analogy). :)

As for more picky things, in the context of casual online 
conversations I&#x27;m not so concerned about stuff like hanging 
prepositions, split infinitives and parallel construction.

The main difficulty I had was this:

if you decompose the permutations into their cycle structure you 
either have to figure out how to invert each possible cycle (either 
by a series of algorithms - at least one for each cycle and then 
only if you have the mental agility to figure out complicated 
conjugations - or else by a method of reducing the cycle length, 
which would also need some computation, probably by 2, in which case 
you might end up with a load of transpositions to take care of which 
would probably involve turning double transpositions into 3 cycles 
and then removing them or using a move to do a transposition of 
corners and a transposition of edges). That seems like an awful lot 
of work.

Two other options would be:

a) figure out the entire solution in advance - this would be done 
mentally, but it seems a bit of a fudge, since you still have sight 
of the cube whilst you work out the solution - but that could be 
quite difficult too.

b) Use a group theoretic description of the cube to condense the 
information into a few short sequences and then fix the sequences 
one by one (without altering the others) - which is basically what 
my method is. It&#x27;s also got some mathematics behind it but you don&#x27;t 
really need to know as much mathematics as in the cycle solution.

All the algorithms I use at the moment are either Jessica Fridrich 
algorithms or concatenations of those algorithms, but I use only a 
very limited number of them.
Maybe soon I will add to these algorithms so I can work towards 
improving speed and efficiency for the World Championships.

That P.S. is a little ironic. : )

Nonetheless, the main function of language is to communicate and it 
is often possible to get the point of your message across without 
having correct punctuation or spelling. Having said that, some 
people are very particular about such matters.

Its an MPEG.  I don&#x27;t know how big the frames are.  Maybe i&#x27;ll upload 
it to the group, then see if anybody can brighten it up.

Yes, I&#x27;ve thought about this - although a relay should have 4 legs 
so you should include the 2x2x2. I was thinking about it from the 
blindfold point of view starting with the 2x2x2 (and therefore 
keeping the hardest one requiring most memory to last, to make the 
challenge more difficult).

<br>
Yes, I think timing 3x3x3, 4x4x4 and then 5x5x5 is a good idea.<br>
In fact I already have one record post for it, but I wait until <br>
someone else also posts a record for it to have some kind of <br>
comparison. I propose that the order of solving is free. (I prefer to <br>
start with the 5x5x5.)<br>
<br>
Of course the biggest difference will be made by the 5x5x5. So if you <br>
are good at that one, then you can set a really good time.<br>
<br>
Hi Heath,<br>
<br>
Nice video! Not the perfect circumstances to speed solve, so also a <br>
very good time. If you make a new video, then please also make sure <br>
the cube is a bit bigger on the screen.<br>
In Windows Media Player you can adjust the brightness of the video <br>
when playing it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here is an idea so the 5x5x5 speeders will not have such an 
advantage.  Do the 5x5x5 once the 4x4x4 twice and the 3x3x3 three or 
four times.  Then the people who are good at the 3x3x3 could have a 
chance to catch up.  Just a thought.

-Kenneth 
P.S.  My problem would then be; I only have one 4x4x4.  Oh well...

&gt; Hi Heath,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Nice video! Not the perfect circumstances to speed solve, so also a <br>
&gt; very good time. If you make a new video, then please also make sure <br>
&gt; the cube is a bit bigger on the screen.<br>
&gt; In Windows Media Player you can adjust the brightness of the video <br>
&gt; when playing it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Have fun,<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
Thanks for the tip Ron.  I downloaded the new version of windows <br>
media player and was able to adjust to brightness on there.  It looks <br>
wayyyyyyy better when you can actually see it :D.  Still im going to <br>
try and get another video done tomorrow thats a little faster, and <br>
zoomed in on the cube a little more. And that you can see without <br>
adjusting it. :P   haha<br>

Okay, now since your really talkin about the cube on T.V.  How about 
the Movie &quot;Dude, wheres my car&quot; lol.  AHHH I cant remember what they 
called the cube in that movie.  If you havn&#x27;t seen the movie then 
maybe you should go out and rent it or somethin.  BUT be warned, its 
almost the stupidest movie ever made. Your IQ will probably go down 
10 points after watching it.  lol.

Well, I&#x27;ve only used the corners first method a little bit, and im 
sure your wayyyyyy faster than me using corners first, but what I try 
to do is see if there is a way to match up 2 corners before i put 
them in position.  And I try to keep other corner matched if they 
already are....i just did an average for first layer corners, and I 
came up with 6.1 moves....(I either did corners on white or yellow)

well *$%! now that I think of it we probably dont do the top corners 
the same.  I just orient the 4 corners, and you probably want them 
permuted too....o well...just tryin to help.

The one thing about pi that made me mad was that in the opening scene 
when they scroll the digits, only the first ten or so are actually 
correct. The rest are seemingly random. How disappointing... *sigh*


However, pi was not really a movie about mathematics. It was just the 
backdrop for a movie about schizophrenia...

I think I&#x27;ve seen that cube movie in the rental store. I&#x27;ll probably 
rent it for kicks.

While I&#x27;ll agree that Lars&#x27; system uses relativily few algorithms, my 
personal opinion is that a simplisitic corners first system would be 
very effective at teaching little kids. There are few algorithms and 
the ones that are there are relatively easy to learn IMO. For 
example, I have a copy of Verasano&#x27;s book which teaches a very easy 
to learn method. You may be able to find something similar on the 
internet.

Well, it&#x27;s more like a kick in the head. I preferred Plan 9 From

Spoiler (the level of mathematics used)














































This movie puts forth ideas like it takes a genius to figure out if 
3 digit numbers like 315, 218 or 732 are prime in less than an hour. 
These numbers were generally (when not prime) divisible by 2, 3 or 5 
so it&#x27;s a bit of an insult in that regard.

Even when it got to something very slightly more complicated - 
whether a number was a prime power or not - it&#x27;s still hardly 
complicated stuff.

Movies involving mathematics (e.g. Cube, Pi, The Mirror Has Two 
Faces) are generally quite annoying in their treatment of the 
mathematics.

Good Will Hunting is another case in point. The Harvard professor 
gives them a full term to do something which can be easily solved by 
a pre-university student (transition matrices and cubing of matrices 
etc. - it certainly isn&#x27;t beyond A-level and some of it is more 
basic yet) in a few minutes and then they reckon the guy is a genius 
because he can do just that. If the problem had been more 
challenging it wouldn&#x27;t have been such an insult.

          <div class="email-content">I think that the easiest way to solve it, that can also be done 
considerably fast is the corners first. You don&#x27;t need to memorize 
very many algorithms, and to do the layer-by-layer method or the Lars 
Petrus method fast, you would need to memorize several algorithms.

Like I said, I don&#x27;t know the corners first method so I don&#x27;t know <br>

Something I think works well for pretty much anybody (including 
little kids) is teach them a simple way to do the F2L, could be: like 
jessicas, lars, a hybrid of the 2, first layer then middle layer 
edges, or however they understand the F2L best.  Then for the LL if 
you take a look @ Dan knights 4 look for LL, and take just the first 
alg for each look you could solve the cube.  You would have to do 
each Step more than once to get it into position, but you only have 
to learn 4 algs!  7 if you count reflections...

Im teaching one of my brothers friends like that.  He is doing the 
F2L mostly like I do.  I just showed him the algs for the LL the day 
before yesterday.  I dont know how dedicate he is to learning the 
algs right away, but he is working on them.  I gave him the algs over 
MSN messenger.  So I bet there would be better (quicker) results if I 
show him in person how to do each step and how to hold the cube and 
all.  
.................

I think a simple corners first method would be good for kids too.  
There would be more algs to learn though. But not TOO many.

Since I cant get that to work.  Lets make sure im on the same &#x27;page&#x27; 
as you.  What im wanting to do is, when the last top layer edge is 
twisted; I want to orient the middle layer edges and flip the top 
layer edge at the same time.  
>From what I have found with those algs.  The ones you said to use, 
the middle layer has to be oriented first, then you flip the last top 
edge, and flip the middle layer edges. I may be wrong, but the only 
way I can get those two algs to work is if I have the middle layer 
oriented first.  If they&#x27;re not oriented all that happens really is 
the top edge gets flipped.

Am I totally losing my mind, by not being able to find the right way

Of course it is adaptable. Like everyone&#x27;s said, it&#x27;s all personal 
preference. A proper corner&#x27;s first system can get you into sub-
twenty seconds with proper practice. Minh Thai used a corners first 
system and won the last championship.

One thing I&#x27;d like to say. Although a corner&#x27;s first system is 
certainly not illogical, one could make a case that a layer&#x27;s system 
makes more sense( though not necessarily). All the cube newbies I&#x27;ve 
encountered have always tried to fix the cube layer by layer as 
opposed to some different approach to it. With the exception of a 
very smart friend of mine who learned the cube by himself and uses a 
corners system. Most people tend to think very linearally. When 
breaking apart problems, they do it in a fashion that is the simplest 
to visualize for them. It could be asserted that a layer or slice is 
easier for a newbie to understand than perhaps the corners of the 
cube.

Of course, this really is dependant on the person and how they think. 
So it may be the best idea to introduce simplified versions of both 
systems and see what the general preference is.

          <div class="email-content">Your comments definitely make sense to me. When I first started 
cubing (no other cubers to talk to -- just me and my cube), I also 
attempted doing it layer-by-layer-by-layer. It never actually 
occurred to me to try anything else. It wasn&#x27;t until my cubing skills 
got more advanced and I was able to talk to other cubers that I 
discovered there were quite a few other strategies, most of which 
were more efficient that the way I&#x27;d been doing it!!

I also completely agree with the comments people have been making 
about personal preference being a factor. There is no answer to the 
question &quot;which is THE best method?&quot; (now I&#x27;m feeling post 
modern...). Some methods are okay for young beginners (eg. Lars&#x27;, 
corners first), some would be very difficult for young beginners (eg. 
Jessica&#x27;s). Of the methods that are okay for young beginners, it 
depends on how your brain works as to which one will be easier to 
pick understand and learn.

I guess what I really meant when I first suggested Lars method is not 
that it is the best method for beginners, just that it is a suitable 
method for beginners.

          <div class="email-content">Lets see if I can help.<br>
let me go through what you wrote..<br>
 <br>
&gt; Since I cant get that to work.  Lets make sure im on the <br>
same &#x27;page&#x27; <br>
&gt; as you.  What im wanting to do is, when the last top layer edge is <br>
&gt; twisted; I want to orient the middle layer edges and flip the top <br>
&gt; layer edge at the same time.  <br>
<br>
So what you want to do is to orient all the edges.  That is what <br>
those algs do.  Once you use the alg then you must position the <br>
middle layer edges.<br>
<br>
&gt; From what I have found with those algs.  The ones you said to use, <br>
&gt; the middle layer has to be oriented first, then you flip the last <br>
top <br>
&gt; edge, and flip the middle layer edges. <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t really know what you are meaning by saying flip and orient.  <br>
But from what I am guessing, you think that all the middle layer <br>
edges must be oriented first then the alg orients the top edge, and <br>
then after the doing the alg you must again orient the middle layer <br>
edges?<br>
<br>
&gt;I may be wrong, but the only <br>
&gt; way I can get those two algs to work is if I have the middle layer <br>
&gt; oriented first.  If they&#x27;re not oriented all that happens really is <br>
&gt; the top edge gets flipped.<br>
<br>
 It is impossible to just flip only one edge.  <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Am I totally losing my mind, by not being able to find the right <br>
way <br>
&gt; to understand this.  Or am I right that the edges have to be <br>
oriented <br>
&gt; first..<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; just to make 100% sure, these are the algs that I was trying... <br>
<br>
My guess is that you are holding the cube wrong, or you might not be <br>
sure of the reason for these algs.<br>
<br>
Here is how you hold the cube for each alg:<br>
<br>
This alg is for when there is the flipped edge in the top layer, and <br>
one flipped one in the middle layer. Make sure that the edge in the <br>
top layer is on the left side, and the one that needs flipping in the <br>
middle layer is on the front right. Then do<br>
&gt; RU2R&#x27;E2R2E&#x27;R&#x27;U2R&#x27;...and... <br>
<br>
This is for when there is the flipped edge in the top layer, and <br>
three flipped in the middle layer. Again make sure that the edge in <br>
the top layer is on the left side, and that the one that does not <br>
need flipping in the middle layer is on the front left.  Then do<br>
<br>
&gt;LELELEL<br>
<br>
One last thing.  You might want to try to do the algs on a finished <br>
cube to get a better idea of what it is doing.<br>
<br>
Good luck and I hope I haven&#x27;t confused you more.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s my 2 cents ...

When I first picked up the cube, it never occurred to me to do either 
corners-first or layer-by-layer.  It seemed obvious to me to do one face, 
then a second face, then a third, etc.

I worked out a method that did just that, doing opposite sides as a time.  
It took me about 10-20 minutes, nearly all that time spent getting the first 
two faces (after that its easy).  The reason it took so long was because the 
algs. I had worked out did not cover all possible outcomes (so the solution 
was incomplete).  But if I kept at it the cube eventually purmuted to a 
pattern that I could solve.

Anyway, that was my intuition!

I have a film called Game Of Death 2 but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a 
Bruce Lee film. Sure he&#x27;s in it but it was made long after he died 
using old footage. Also, his character dies in it pretty early on as 
he does something rather crazy involving a coffin and a helicopter.

It&#x27;s sort of an inverse to the (planned) Game Of Death, where the 
main guy has to go down an underground tower instead of up through 
floors of a building (as in Game Of Death), a building which would 
have been taller had Bruce Lee lived long enough to complete the 
film.

It&#x27;s a little while since I&#x27;ve watched Game Of Death 2, but I don&#x27;t 
think it had bad mathematics in it.

          <div class="email-content">I totally agree with you. In order to make the layer-by-layter method 
fast, you need to memorize about 100 algorithms. Layer by layer is 
the first one I learned, and I learned about twenty algorithms and I 
could do it in an average of 2 minutes 15 seconds. Corners is 
definitely the best way that is also easy.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I&#x27;d avoided the argumentative portion of this discussion so 
far, but I had to respond to this one!

Lars - I realize your method isn&#x27;t a &quot;typical&quot; layer by layer method 
(cross, F2L, LL), but it is still essentially layer by layer (unless 
you&#x27;ve converted to a corners first method).  There are just two 
relatively minor differences:
1) you don&#x27;t wait for U edges to be complete before starting work on 
the rest of the F2L
2) you orient D edges before completing the F2L
So, are you also complaining about having learned the method that you 
use? Secondly, are you saying that layer by layer is bad in general 
(&quot;you&#x27;re condemning those people to a life time of inferior 
cubing&quot;)?  I was under the impression that several sub 20 speed 
cubists used a layer by layer method, making it arguable which 
is &quot;better&quot;.

Using the layer by layer method, I personally average under 35 
seconds. I realize this is by no means spectacular, but I&#x27;m still 
using a 3 look LL, and my F2L leaves quite a bit to be desired (I&#x27;m 
very poor at looking ahead, but I&#x27;m working on it). When I was first 
trying to speed things up, I tried learning a standard layer by layer 
method and your method.  I found your method for the F2L to be 
difficult, but maybe I just didn&#x27;t spend enough time working through 
it.

Just recently I&#x27;ve looked into using the corners first method. I 
don&#x27;t have any algs memorized yet, but using algs found on 
speedcubing.com and elsewhere, I&#x27;ve found that it takes me at least 
60-70 steps, while using my regular method, I can routinely solve in 
50-60 steps.  Again, I may just have a poor grasp of how to do it, 
but I can&#x27;t make the corners first method very efficient.

That said, I don&#x27;t see why a layer by layer method should be labeled 
as &quot;such a bad method&quot; since the other options don&#x27;t seem reasonable 
for any sort of speed for me (obviously not in general though, 
because there are those who can use the other methods and solve in 
sub 20 times).

          <div class="email-content">A corners first method is not as hard to comprehend as you think.  
The way I learned was to solve a face, then solve the bottom corners, 
then the bottom edges.  As a beginner I didn&#x27;t think of it as a 
corners first, but as solving a face then the opposite face and then 
the middle.  I ended up having to learn only three algs to do the 
cube. Using this method as a beginner really appealed to me, and 
everyone I teach.  To say corners-first is harder to comprehend as a 
beginner, is ridiculous.  
My 2 cents.

          <div class="email-content">lets try this a different way.  <br>
<br>
heres my situation; the last top layer edge is in place, but <br>
twisted.  And the middle layer edges are totally scrambled.  What i <br>
want to do is flip that top layer edge so it is correct (which those <br>
algs do), and i want to orient the middle layer edges all in one alg.<br>
<br>
the move LELELEL solves the cube when you need one top layer edge <br>
flipped, and  3 middle layer edges flipped.  as i said earlier my <br>
middle layer edges aren&#x27;t oriented yet.  but that move does work <br>
great when all the middle layer edges are in place but 3 need flipped.<br>
<br>
if you still dont understand, then i guess im doing something wrong.  <br>
I have no idea what though, because I would bet my best speed cube <br>
that I am right.  And if i am doing somethin wrong i guess im a lost <br>
cause.  so i&#x27;ll just have to figure out the algs im lookin for <br>
another way....(maybe usin Rons cube solver)....<br>

till next time.<br>

          <div class="email-content">We&#x27;re using different terms here. When I say &quot;layer by layer&quot; [LBL] I 
mean a method where you first build the first layer, then the second, 
and finally the third.

This is painfully inefficient, since with one solved layer, there is 
absolutely nothing meaningful you can do with out breaking up that 
layer. So all the algorithms go

1. Break up the first layer
2. Do something useful
3. Restore the first layer

Obviously, that first layer is really just a decoration, not a true 
step on the way to the solution. Good solutions only have algs of 
type 2 in them.

It seems you think of any method that ends up with solving a final 
layer as a LBL method. I&#x27;m not saying that is right or wrong, only 
that that is not what I meant.

The LBL methods ugly cousin is the face by face method, which is 
probably *really* the first method most people try. It is in 
disrepute due to be almost impossible to solve by though.

To be clear: The Jessica method is not at all a LBL method with my 
definition. I like to think of it as the LBL method, with the steps 3 
and 1 taken out of it. Which of course makes it a non LBL method... 
But it makes sense to me...

          <div class="email-content">The layer by layer method is indeed inefficient for speed. Well, I <br>
guess it isn&#x27;t too bad, my friend is doing a LBL with a 4 or 5 look <br>
last layer in under a minute.  He has a personal best in the 40&#x27;s.  <br>
The thing about a LBL is that it is easily adabptable to an F2l and a <br>
2 look LL.  <br>
Lars method isn&#x27;t exactly a LBL method.  But it has its similarites.<br>
Its more of a &quot;cube constructing&quot; or an &quot;expanding&quot; plan.  When i <br>
first started cubing, i thought the most logical way of solving was <br>
creating a 2x2 then a 2x2x3 then a 2x3x3.  It worked but I wasn&#x27;t <br>
good at it.  I don&#x27;t think i got under 2 min using it.  But then <br>
again I was a beginer with no understanding.  <br>
<br>
Also the corners first method is also similar to a LBL method.  Once <br>
you complete the corners, some do top layer, middle layer, and final <br>
the bottom layer.  Some do top and bottom with middle last.  But All <br>
solutions has their ties with a LBL method.  They just have their own <br>
unique twist to them<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I get what you&#x27;re saying now - yes layer by layer is bad, but 
as j_rueth points out in another message, layer by layer does adapt 
well to a F2L and 2 look LL method, which can end up very fast. I 
think, then, that we agree.

   Hey all... it&#x27;s been awhile. For those of you who remember my 
original &quot;Cuber&#x27;s Curse&quot; posting, I&#x27;m most pleased to announce that 
she and I are now &#x27;dating.&#x27; I put this in quotation marks because we

for CSUN. So we&#x27;re just taking it slow to see how a semi-long

Hooray there is hope! Man, I&#x27;m happy right now... it&#x27;s only been a 
day.
   (For those of you who are not familiar with my post, you can 
search for it, or hear the really short version now which is there&#x27;s 
a girl I&#x27;ve wanted for 6 years (since 8th grade) who thought I didn&#x27;t

during that relationship and on :) All is right in the world 
Ahhhh....) Anyone else as happy as I am?

Perhaps it will be a good thing -- you can still cube everyday and 
she won&#x27;t know!

Rubiks.com and Mefferts are both good for the 4x4x4... As far as the 
5x5x5 goes, I believe Meffert&#x27;s is the only makers of it unless you 
can find an old one on E-bay or something. I had bad luck TWICE with 
buying the Professor&#x27;s cube at Meffert&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m a bit sore about 
that. You still may get a functional cube from them though. And 
shipping is free! If the cube doesn&#x27;t work you can send it back for 
full refund.

I love the two 5x5x5 cubes i bought from mefferts.  Both move great.  
I am not so happy with their 4x4x4.  The first day one of the orange 
stickers fell off.  Also mefferts&#x27; 4x4x4 didn&#x27;t seem to move as 
well.  I almost bought a 4x4x4 from rubik&#x27;s.com but there was a 
shipping fee and decided not to pay that much for it. Oh well...

I have a friend who bought Meffert&#x27;s Megaminx and he liked it. The 
only potential problems with it are the stickers and the fact that it 
is kind of stiff to move. Don&#x27;t buy meffert&#x27;s 3x3x3, the assembly 
cube is horrible for cubing fast. Meffert&#x27;s has good Square-1, 
pyraminx and skewb.

          <div class="email-content">I am enjoying my 4x4 from rubiks.  The stickers are pretty bad.  My <br>
friend has had one for some time as well.  I think the big problem <br>
with the 4x4 is that the centers like to break.  <br>
5x5s on the other hand... Mefferts are ok.  They turn nice, but for <br>
speeding they like to grab and rotate the center corner cubies.  <br>
Often when I&#x27;m using it, a 2x2x5 group tends to pop out. So i try not <br>
to use it to often.  Instead i have a 5x5 that i bought almost a year <br>
ago off of ebay.  No troubles with this one.  Don&#x27;t know who makes it <br>
or who sells em.  But that 5x5 worked best for me!<br>
For other puzzles the skewb is tons of fun and easy to solve.  It is <br>
a fast puzzle<br>

Speaking of skewbs, is anyone skewbing at the RWC?<br>

Dip a cotton bud into white spirit and gently clean the cube face 
with that.  It will take a few seconds to completely clean.  Dry with 
a paper towel.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s also how I clean my cubes, Robert. It works very well. If I 
only need to replace a few stickers, I just remove the glue with a 
damp towel. But I never use strong glue to put the stickers on so I 
can clean it more easily afterwards. I used to use Super Glue but it 
ruins your cube. The stickers still hold very well with the one I use 
now.

I disagree. Once you have the cross formed, each F2L algorithm places 
corner/edge pairs into &quot;slots.&quot; And you&#x27;ve broken nothing. If you 
wasted time putting a corners and edges in seperately, then you would 
be breaking the first layer. This is not the case though. You&#x27;re sort 
of right about the last layer, but by the time any method gets down 
to its last steps, you have to temporarily break parts that you&#x27;ve 
already done.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!
I placed an order from Rubiksshop.com
I bought 3x3x3 and 4x4x4. Also bought extra stickers for both, and 
there cube-lub.
The lub isn´t that good, so I wouldn´t recomend you to buy it.
I also didn´t like the 3x3x3 cube. The center pieces are a little 
larger than the rest which makes it turn poorly.
I think I was unlucky getting one that´s sort of defect.
The 4x4x4 is great. Turns smoothly and feels great!
At first I thought the freight cost was way to high. $15 USD.
But when I got a knock on my door from Schenker (freight company like 
UPS) with my cubes I was impressed. Even a taxi costs more than $15 
to my home. So with this in mind it wasn´t so expensive. But I do 
think they should have a cheaper alternativ where I go to the post 
office and sign for it instead.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone.  I have been working on getting my F2L times down, and on the <br>
bus one night last week I suddenly had the following idea for a practice <br>
routine that might be helpful ...<br>
<br>
The F2L requires moving four corner/edge pairs (CEPs) into four &quot;slots&quot;.  So <br>
four sequences are required to complete F2L.  There are sets of algorithyms <br>
that do not disturb the other three slots, and usually people learn these <br>
first.  Sometimes it is possible to slot a CEP using a shorter algorithm <br>
that displaces one or more slots: these shortcuts can be used when you know <br>
that the slots being displaced have not yet been solved.<br>
<br>
So, you end up becoming familiar with a whole bunch of algorithms for <br>
solving F2L.<br>
<br>
OK; for the rest of this email I am ignoring inflections and inversions.<br>
<br>
The shortest algorithm for slotting a CEP is either:<br>
R U R&#x27;   OR   R U&#x27;R&#x27;<br>
If I am able to slot a CEP with one of these and nothing else I feel pretty <br>
lucky!  Most of the time I need a longer algorithm, BUT: nearly all of the <br>
algorithms I use end with R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27; (there are a few exceptions).  In <br>
other words, I do a 3-move sequence that sets the CEP up so that R U R&#x27;/R <br>
U&#x27;R&#x27; does the trick.<br>
<br>
So, when I do the F2L (cross on bottom) the solving process divides into two <br>
parts:<br>
1) LOOK:<br>
  1a) find a CEP that needs solving<br>
  1b) note where the corresponding slot is<br>
  1c) identify the best (i.e. quickest) algorithm to use (so really plan all <br>
of step 2), that follows<br>
2) EXECUTE, without a pause, the following:<br>
  2a) U/U&#x27;/U2 - 1 in 4 chance that this is needed, but using alternative <br>
sequences reduces this<br>
  2b) some 3-move sequence<br>
  2c) R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;<br>
1) look: identify another CEP etc.<br>
2) execute<br>
1) ... etc., four times<br>
<br>
This ends up as follows (everything in brackets is done without pause):<br>
look - (some 3/4-move sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;) - look - (some 3/4-move <br>
sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;) - look - (some 3/4-move sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;) <br>
- look - (some 3/4-move sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
To speed this up, the general advice is &quot;look ahead&quot;: that is, combine the <br>
looking with the executing.  Another usual tip here is to slow down, which <br>
funnily enough makes sense: slowing down makes it easier to do that looking <br>
ahead stuff.<br>
<br>
OK, here&#x27;s my idea.  As a practice routine, try this instead:<br>
look - (some 3/4 move sequence) - look - (R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27; + some 3/4 move <br>
sequence) - look - (R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27; + some 3/4 move sequence) - look - (R U <br>
R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27; + some 3/4 move sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
In other words, split the slotting process so that you force yourself to <br>
work out the BEST move sequence for the next CEP before completing the <br>
sequence at hand.<br>
<br>
If you find this too hard to start with, then you could do this instead:<br>
look - (some 3/4 move sequence + R U/R U&#x27;) - look - (R&#x27; + some 3/4 move <br>
sequence + R U/R U&#x27;) - look - (R&#x27; + some 3/4 move sequence + R U/R U&#x27;) - <br>
look - (R&#x27; + some 3/4 move sequence + R U R&#x27;/R U&#x27;R&#x27;)<br>
and then graduate up to looking two moves ahead, and then three moves ahead.<br>
<br>
I think that by practising in this way, it might be possible to get a handle <br>
on this &quot;looking ahead&quot; business.  At the very least, it starts getting your <br>
brain into a looking ahead frame of mind<br>
<br>
What do you all think?<br>

you are right! This is what I meant in my posting No. 801 in hint 
No. 2. Today, I am planning to post on my page examples of how I 
solve and how I think during the F2L so that you can see those 
little tricks I use in F2L (and some of them are of the type you 
mentioned in your e-mail).

On this page, I ask you to scramble the cube using a scrambling <br>
algorithm that I provide and then I walk you step-by-step through <br>
different possibilities for the cross and corner-edge pairs showing <br>
little tricks along the way.<br>
<br>
I also added to my page the hints I posted in message No. 801:<br>

<br>
Both pages are linked through my main cube and system pages.<br>

Let me know if this is useful.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I bought a megaminx from Mefferts a couple years ago, when they came 
with tiles. If you don&#x27;t like the stickers, you can always buy a set 
of tiles for $12 (but keep in mind you&#x27;ll have to glue on all 132 of 
them!).

Mine didn&#x27;t move very well at first (my first time-trials were more 
than 8 minutes after breaking it in quite a bit), but with some 
silicone lube, and a lot of playing with it, it&#x27;s become farily 
smooth (my average solve now is around 3 minutes even).

As far as the assembly cube, I would have to agree - they aren&#x27;t good 
for speed.  You will find that overturning becomes a real problem - 
it almost moves too easily.  Also, they don&#x27;t have the give required 
for finger tricks.

          <div class="email-content">Let me preface what I say with this; I&#x27;ve found that at least for 
working with the oinkleburger.com applet, centers last ends up having 
many more moves than centers first.  Therefore, you may want to 
consider trying centers first.  However, as my master cube is 
currently broken, I can&#x27;t really test the alternatives on a physical 
4x4x4 cube, so feel free to disregard this advice! Also, fixing the 
parity problems encountered with a centers first method can require 
some fairly lengthly algs to be memorized.

Anyways, these may not be the most efficient algs to use, but try 
this.  I&#x27;m not sure what semantics you&#x27;re used to, but here&#x27;s what 
I&#x27;ll use:
1) r, u, and d are the slices next to R, U, and D respectively
2) E&#x27; is equivelant to ud&#x27;
3) Centers will be described by their face and position on the face 
(e.g. Fdr is the center on F in the d and r slices)

For each sequence I&#x27;ll indicate either which pieces move from F and D 
or which stay in their respecive faces.
2 pair swap - moves Fdr, Fdl, Dbr, and Dbl
(rd&#x27;r&#x27;d)F&#x27;(rd&#x27;r&#x27;d)D&#x27;(rd&#x27;r&#x27;d)DF

2 treo swap - leaves Ful and Dbl
(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)F&#x27;(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)D2(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)D2F

Face swap - moves all 4 centers from D to F and vice versa
(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)F2(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)D2(rE&#x27;r&#x27;E)D2F2

Try it out.  Let me know if I made a mistake. Good luck!

Is the 6 colour megaminx or the 12 colour megaminx more difficult? <br>
I got a megaminx a while back but some of the stickers started to <br>
fall off almost immediately, so I have decided to paint it (plus <br>
some of my cubes) and I want to know which is harder.<br>
<br>
Certainly the corner pieces have positions uniquely determined in <br>
either puzzle and in that respect the 6 colour one is arguably <br>
harder as it requires more time to determine where a corner belongs, <br>
but possibly the similar edge pieces in a 6 colour puzzle can be <br>
permuted in different ways (using double transpositions) that can&#x27;t <br>
arise in a 12 colour one - yielding more solutions. I imagine that <br>
latter possibility can arise.<br>
<br>
So, should I paint it with 12 colours or with 6?<br>
<br>
At the moment I only have 1 colour, :  ), which is blue, which I <br>
picked up today. One of the blue stickers from my 5x5x5 is missing <br>
so I hope to start doing the blue face of that and then go on to the <br>
others if it seems to work (and if I can get the colours).<br>

          <div class="email-content">With a 6 color megaminx, you might be able to locate your edge pieces 
more quickly in the beginning because there are two of each piece and 
you only need to find one of them, but on the other hand the 12 color 
megaminx has fewer pieces with each color, so if you are looking for 
a piece with a specific color, it should stand out more.  At the end 
you can have a parity problem which requires swapping two opposite 
edge pieces.  The 12 color megaminx shouldn&#x27;t have parity problems.

It might also be interesting to look for a different color 
arrangement of the 6 color megaminx that doesn&#x27;t have identical 
colors opposite each other but retains some sort of symmetry.  The 
parity problem might be easier because you could have identical 
pieces that are closer together.

I&#x27;m in a similar rut, although my average is lower.  I do a cross, then a <br>

I think most people who can get as far as you have in your cube

OK, after F2L I orient edges which is one alg forward for opposite edges <br>
or the reverse for diagonal edges, or both together for all four edges to <br>
be oriented.  Then I permute edges which is usually a Sune but sometimes a <br>
plus shaped swap for which I use a real PLL alg (cause it&#x27;s quicker than <br>
doing two sunes).  Then I permute corners for which I know a two way alg <br>
to cycle three corners, one for parallel swaps or a pair of Sunes for <br>
diagonal swaps.  Finally, orient corners using pairs of Sunes.<br>
<br>
Sune is the daddy :)<br>
<br>
My current average for the whole cube is perhaps 38, which is pretty good <br>
for an in-efficient system but it takes me so long to think sometimes, <br>
even with so few algs!.  I just think that if I added more specialized <br>
algs, I&#x27;d have to work sooo hard on my thinking times.  And as I said <br>
before, I&#x27;m lazy!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow, thought someone would reply to this by now.  Ok, so I will.  
These are great pages.  The examples now make many things clear to me. 
Foremost being that my F2l are really pathetic, and that it will take 
years to get to the level needed for sub-20 sec.  

So I just have one question.  In the examples, how do you perform some 
of those moves?  Take F U2 F&#x27;U B U B&#x27; for instance.  I assume it&#x27;s 
best to rotate the cube at least once, for the move to be easier to 
perform.  

Anyway, the pages are eye openers, and I hope others find them as 
helpful as I do.  Thanks.

Having read your message again, I&#x27;ve had a thought.  As detailed in my <br>
previous message, I don&#x27;t do it in the order you mentioned.  I do OE, PE, <br>
PC and OC.  I guess that means that there are good 4-look systems and CRAP <br>
ones!  I think I could easily change my 4-look order to the one you <br>
mentioned simply by learning a few PLL algs.  That would be the ideal <br>
stepping stone to learning more and more PLL&#x27;s that deal with edges and <br>
corners in one fell swoop, which would give me the 3-look.  I&#x27;ll worry <br>
about OLL in a few years!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I use the Lars Petrus method, so the edges are already correctly 
oriented. I just position the corners, orient the corners, then 
position the edges.
By the way, I hear people talk about two-looks and three-looks etc., 
but I don&#x27;t know wht this means. does it mean you can solve it by 
only looking at it twice or three times? That&#x27;s what i would guess it

          <div class="email-content">On the weekend I was starting to teach someone about the cube. It was <br>
just after we&#x27;d all had that discussion about which method to teach a <br>
beginner so this was on my mind. I don&#x27;t know the corners first <br>
method, so obviously that was out. So, I thought an F2L (cross first) <br>

that people don&#x27;t want to deal with more than a face initally (let <br>
alone a layer, or shock horror - 2 layers!). If I try to explain F2L <br>
they say &#x27;that&#x27;s way too complicated, I&#x27;m just trying to do a face <br>
for now&#x27;. I&#x27;m feeling conflicted because we all know that &#x27;just doing <br>
a face&#x27; (not even a layer) is not the first step in *any* complete <br>
cube solution (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here?). Having said this, <br>
working on doing a face at least helps familiarise the new cuber with <br>
basic twists and turns and gives them some experience with how to <br>
move a piece from where it is to where they want it to be.<br>
<br>
Once he&#x27;s confident at doing a face, maybe then cross --&gt; F2L will <br>

          <div class="email-content">I also taught someone the cube this weekend.  First He just wanted 
help doing a side (not a face) then after about 5 side solves, I gave 
him pointers to do a face, which he finally did after about 20 min of 
practice.  Then we talked about the basic facts about the cube, I 
took mine apart and showed him how it worked (a real eye opener for 
him.)  Then because I do corners first, I taught him an easy corners 
first method where you do a face then the opposite corners.  This 
required two algorithms for the corners.  He surprised me on how fast 
he learned them.  Then we put the bottom edges in.  Followed by the 
last edge in the top layer.  Now with two complete faces, just a 4-
move alg to position the middle layer, and one last alg to orient the 
middle layer.   After being able to do a face, it took him only 30

It&#x27;s also good for showing that it actually consists of 8 corners and <br>

Everyone is talking about taking/ripping there cubes apart.<br>
I ordered one from the US (rubiksshop.com), and I´m terrified to take <br>
it apart. I tried placing a flat screwdriver under a edge-cube and <br>
twisting carefully. But it didn´t &quot;pop&quot;.<br>
I afraid to place more power into the screwdriver.<br>
I took a non-brand-cube apart and it was never the same again (rest <br>
in pieces).<br>
How can I be sure that I won´t break it. Don´t want to have to order <br>
a new one again so soon. My girlfriend will kill me if I (in her <br>
works) throw more money away on frieght costs instead of buying a <br>
cheap one.... :-(<br>
Hope someone has a tip on how I also can take it apart. Realy need to <br>

You&#x27;re almost certainly better off doing centres first - I used to 
do centres last and it is a lot slower.
Anyway, there are moves that&#x27;ll take 2 centres from the D face to 
the F face but I don&#x27;t know any that take 3 or 4 - except for doing 
a couple of moves with 1/2 moving.

Here&#x27;s a one to take centres from the R face to the F face - you can 
easily adapt it but I&#x27;m starting work in 3 minutes and haven&#x27;t time 
to figure out the translation.

r&#x27;u&#x27;dru2d2r&#x27;u&#x27;drF2r&#x27;ud&#x27;ru2d2r&#x27;ud&#x27;rF2

That&#x27;ll do this to the centres and it won&#x27;t change any of the other 
pieces, at least if my mind is working this is correct:

 F    R
a b  e f
c d  g h

 F    R

d f  e c
b h  g a

speed-cube all sandy.  Instead of it being nice and smooth, it was <br>
incredibly stiff.  Thinking I would hurt it I was not going to touch <br>
it until I cleaned it.  Soon after someone guy told me that no one <br>
could solve the cube, and I ended proving him wrong with my sandy <br>
cube.  Anyway, when I got home I took it apart and started cleaning.  <br>
Then once clean and re-lubed, my cube was quicker than normal.  The <br>
sand ended up helping my cube.  Anyway if anyone wants to sand their <br>
cube, do it literally and put a small amount of sand in, twist, and <br>
clean.  It worked for me.  Anyway just thought I would share.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah! I figured I&#x27;d get yiped at for doing a centers last.  But what <br>
i like about the centers last is fixing the parity problem and all <br>
the &quot;cage moves&quot; or much easier than the centers first.  Plus i <br>
dropped nine min. using a centers last. I was at 13 or 14 min.  Now <br>
I&#x27;m at 4 or 5 min.  There is still plenty of places to improve on but <br>
I&#x27;m working a lot with my 3x3.  <br>

Thanks for all the help!  I will certainly try them out!<br>

The theory, of course, being that you COULD look and decide what needs doing<br>
next, close your eyes, perform the alg, then open them again to look and<br>
decide what needs doing next.  In real life you look ALL the time, try to<br>
see where things are at all times and where they will end up.  If you are<br>
good at this, and you do know where they will end up, you have a head start<br>
deciding what alg will be needed next.<br>
<br>
Another way to describe it is; I use a 4-look LL at the moment, therefore I<br>
use 4 separate algs to finish LL<br>

i have long since abandoned that for a big pile of unsorted special <br>

I&#x27;m curious - what happened to your recent oinkleburger 4x4x4 time. 
Did you scramble the cube, and come back and solve it later, because 
there&#x27;s no way it would have taken that long under ordinary 
circumstances?

5) After the one piece is out, the rest should come with no trouble.

I avoid using a screw driver or anything else hard, because I feel 
like I&#x27;m scratching up the inside of my cube.

While we&#x27;re on the subject of taking cubes apart - DanG said we&#x27;re 
going to have to take our cubes apart for inspection at the 
competition.  Anyone have any good tips for taking apart a master 
cube without excessive force?  I can get it apart, but with that 
cube, I am afraid I&#x27;m going to break it (a previous one broke while 
simply solving it)!  The main problem I have here, is that a master 
cube has no springs in it, so there isn&#x27;t the same sort of give. 
Also, the centers and corners aren&#x27;t held on by very much!

That&#x27;s how I take mine apart too, it&#x27;s so easy on my favorite cube.<br>
<br>
But when I got my Rubenking cube, it was so stiff that I knew it had to <br>
have a proper lube.  I struggled for about 15 mins, scared of breaking it.<br>
   It just didn&#x27;t seem to be moving at all!  In the end, by using tools, it <br>
just went SNAP!!! and the bit nearly took my eye brow off!  No damage done <br>
though, and it was fine after the lube.<br>

I think part of the trouble was the short throw springs, just not enough <br>
give.  I also had an assembly cube that didn&#x27;t like coming apart the <br>
regular way, it was easier to take a centre off first.  Do you know <br>
perhaps if yours in an assembly cube?  There will be a hole on each centre,<br>
  perhaps under the sticker (rub the sticker to detect the little hole).<br>

records on speedcubing.com 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/recs_cube_444.html). It looks like 
you&#x27;re already on there.

Concerning method, I do centers first, followed by matching up the 
edges, solve it like a 3x3x3 (use your favorite method - Lars, 
corners first, etc.), and finally fix any parity problems you come 
across.  I&#x27;m sure the method I ended up with was kind of pieced 
together from ideas I got from multiple sources (just like my 3x3x3 
solution). To see it in action, you could replay some solves of mine 
or others from the oinkleburger applet 
(http://www.oinkleburger.com/Cube/Net/?showscores=1#o4), provided you 
don&#x27;t find it too hard to follow. One of these days, I&#x27;ll add a 
rubiks section to my website that will show my methods (when I 
finally get the time for it).

anything about this method and I wasn&#x27;t near the internet at the time <br>
so I thought I&#x27;d just use intuition and and use/adapt algorithms I <br>
already know.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure this is a totally inefficient way of doing it but I was just <br>
playing around. First I did the cross on top, then filled in the top <br>
corners, then permuted and oriented the bottom corners (separately), <br>
then worked on the middle and bottom layer edges. I couldn&#x27;t <br>
completely finish it, but I got it all done except for 3 edges (on <br>
different slices -- if they had been on the same slice I would have <br>
finished it). I got this far without any trouble at all which made me <br>
think that the corners first method is easier than I originally <br>
thought. I&#x27;m guessing I was probably only 1 or 2 algorithms away from <br>
a complete solve? I shall have to investigate this method more deeply <br>

Thanks for your new pages. That&#x27;s good to see how you solve the cube. <br>
I wondered how I solve this. Then tried. <br>

I did it 21.00 sec without warming up. <br>
F2L part was a kind of lucky and very easy cases. <br>
But my hand was stopped to look for the first pair. <br>
And ELL is the slowest alg. <br>
I might be able to solve in 20 sec if I was really settled. <br>
I wish I could see how others solve this! <br>

If you have a springless cube, popping out edges may not be healthy. 
Then again, a springless cube can&#x27;t be good for speed cubing, no?

I think it is possible to slightly improve on this. Chris&#x27; solution 
does opposite centres but if after the first 2 centres you do 
adjacent centres I think it is a little quicker.

Anyway, sub-1:30 is possible on a revenge although it is not easy.

parity problem.  The parity algs are short though.<br>

Well, I wasn&#x27;t meaning to include the Newcastle game in the total 
time of just over 2 hours if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re unsure about!
The time given was just for the cube (memorization and solving).

Don&#x27;t think so - but then I don&#x27;t have the advantage of knowing your 
team.

Well, it would have been enough for the official world record (had 
it been officially done) but apparently Geir Ugelstad can do &quot;4 or 
more&quot; (not sure how many &quot;more&quot; is).

Use what works. I use letters for the edges for the Revenge.

Could&#x27;ve gone faster but I spent a while trying to remember if Cube 
3 had corner orientation

1 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 or 1 2 2 0 2 1 0 1

and whether cube 4 had corner orientation

1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 or 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 2.

I knew that the corners in positions 2 and 8 needed twisting +1 and 
+2 respectively in one cube and +2 and +1 respectively in the other 
but I spent a while at the start of cube 3 trying to remember which 
was which - in fact, I oriented cube 3&#x27;s edges first while I was 
mulling it over.

In the past 2 attempts I had failed by the slightest margins, in one 
of them I had a trio of edges in the second cube which I couldn&#x27;t 
recall the twist needed (1 or 2). I went with 2, although I had 
thought 1 at first and it turned out 1 was right and that was all 
that was wrong in that attempt. In the following attempt, I forgot 
that I had to flip the edges in positions 11, 12 of the 4th cube and 
that was all that went wrong in that attempt so I didn&#x27;t want to 
mees up this time. In each of those attempts the 4 cubes tooks about 
45 minutes after the blindfold went on, but they were narrow misses.

I spent the first 17 minutes getting the info into my head and the 
next 43 making sure it was in my head and that I was ready, so I 
think that 2 hours can be cut quite a lot. Certainly, I think it 
could be done in less than one and a half hours, especially by 
people with better memories.

Anyway, I&#x27;ve only found blue and white matt paint on the IOM so my 
project to paint my 5x5x5 (it had one sticker missing so couldn&#x27;t be 
used for blindfold cubing but hopefully it will be OK when it is 
painted) and my megaminx are a long way from complete.

I think 2 3x3x3&#x27;s and a 4x4x4 will be my next blindfold project 
(before the 5x5x5 or 3 3x3x3&#x27;s and a 4x4x4). That would be better 
than the first 3 legs of the relay and better than 4 3x3x3&#x27;s (in the 
sense that although it requires less memorization the 4x4x4 is much 
harder than 2 3x3x3&#x27;s).

Please excuse my ignorance (I am still yet to acquire a Revenge 
cube!), could you please briefly explain to me how to read this 
notation? Or, point me to a website which does? Thanks.

O.K. Here is what i do.<br>
<br>
1. find the center sliders that are bigger than the rest.  There <br>
should be two or three, i&#x27;m not quite sure. than insert them into one <br>
cubie.<br>
<br>
2. Put the other cubies together, with no.1, and make a layer.<br>
<br>
3. Insert skeleton<br>
<br>
4. Finish top layer cubies.<br>

If you need more detail just ask but i think this should be good <br>

And, like you, I solved it simply by using two 3x3x3 algorithems. All 
you have to do is see it as a 3x3x3 cube without edges. A corners-
first-method might work best? :-)

Jessica is hosting my pages for me:

http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf

[I never quite finished this, but the only missing bit isn&#x27;t 
essential - I shall probably update it with a new method which I 
hope to develop soon, but I will not do the update until after next 
August. : )]

or 

http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BC.html but I 
haven&#x27;t updated that for a while. I really should - I have all but 
one of the cubes that I have done blindfolded since my last update 
written up (the other one, I couldn&#x27;t remember the details of) but I 
can&#x27;t remember the order in which I did some of the most distant 
ones.

I couldn&#x27;t get the BC.html file to load this morning but the other 
one should be enough.

&gt; should be two or three, i&#x27;m not quite sure. than insert them into one<br>
&gt; cubie.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. Put the other cubies together, with no.1, and make a layer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3. Insert skeleton<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 4. Finish top layer cubies.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you need more detail just ask but i think this should be good<br>
&gt; enough, maybe<br>

&gt; <br>
Evil Bazza, are you in England?  You sound like an Essex boy to me :]<br>
<br>
Jake is right, these things suck!<br>
<br>
Another point to add to Jake&#x27;s email is that the skeleton has to be inserted<br>
in the right orientation in relation to the cubie that has the two larger<br>
sliders in it.  If you put the skeleton in the wrong way round, the cube<br>
can&#x27;t turn.  You&#x27;ll find that three prongs of the skeleton are fixed and the<br>
other three have sleeves on them so they can freely rotate.<br>
<br>
Also, when you come to put the last piece in, it&#x27;s hard!  You&#x27;ll really feel<br>
like it&#x27;s going to break.  Maybe it will, I can&#x27;t promise anything!  All I<br>
can say is shut your eyes, push hard and keep your fingers crossed!<br>
<br>
If you are indeed in Essex, email me and we&#x27;ll meet up, I&#x27;ll fix the cube<br>
for you!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Corners question? <br>
<br>
Today I was wondering about what I should work on next in my pursuit <br>
to lower my average.  I do corners first.  I know all 42 algs to do <br>
the bottom corners, and next I was going to move on and learn the <br>
next 14 to fix the last edge in the up layer, and orient the middle <br>
layer.<br>
<br>
I came up with a couple ideas about what to do next and I was <br>
wondering what other people did.  Here are my ideas.  <br>
<br>
First instead of using the algs from speedcubing.com that fixes the <br>
last edge and orients the middle layer, could one be able to learn <br>
enough algs to just finish the cube.  If so how many algs would it <br>
require?  Would it be 56 ( I got this number from all the algs on <br>
speedcubing.com, which is 14 times the 4 possibilities for the <br>
position of the middle layer).  Does anyone finish the cube like <br>
this, or would it be too many algs to have good recognition times?<br>
<br>
My second idea is this.  Because I have not yet learned the algs from <br>
speedcubing.com to fix the last edge and orient the middle layer, I <br>
normally will put the last edge in the top layer, completing two <br>
sides, then position the middle layer, then orient either two or four <br>
edges.  After much practice I do this process pretty quickly without <br>
much thought.  Especially when I fix the last edge in the up layer. <br>
So to learn the algs would really slow me down (at least for a while) <br>
because I would have to un-learn doing this.  So here is my next <br>
idea.  What if I keep putting the last edge in the up layer, and then <br>
learn, I think, 16 algs to orient and position the middle layer in <br>
one move, which would finish the cube.  Or should I just learn the <br>
algs on speedcubing.com and deal with the slower times?  Could <br>
finishing the cube like this be a good idea?  Does anyone finish the <br>
cube like this? And if it were a good idea how would I come up with <br>
the algs to do this for me?<br>
<br>
Any help would be much appreciated.<br>

If you can think of a way I can take it down to less than that 
(without failing in the attempt) I&#x27;d be interested in the idea.

You&#x27;ll be surprised to hear that I haven&#x27;t studied them.

I knew it was not going to be too quick yesterday as I took a while 
over the centres.

I guess not, although there&#x27;s no reason why the surrounding space 
should also be enclosed or small.

I have put it in the links section. It&#x27;s a first edition draft. By 
the end of next year, I hope to have a more sophisticated version.

It´s quite simple.... don´t use a blindfold.
Place hands and cube inside a pillowcase for example. Now you can 
watch TV while blindcubing :-)

It&#x27;s likely that that would not be as fast. You can always just 
close your eyes instead of be blindfolded, of course. Watching TV 
would probably take too much concentration. You can listen to other 
stuff but watching and listening is probably too distracting, in my 
humble opinion.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the reply.  I was wondering who is marc waterman, and how <br>
fast was he, or is he?  <br>
<br>
Also in your reply under #2 you said:<br>
<br>
 &quot;2-even after performing the last edge and orienting the middle <br>
edges there is still a possibility that a positioning move has to be <br>
executed before the cube is completely solved...&quot;<br>
<br>
I was wondering because there is a good possibility that a <br>
positioning move has to be executed, how many moves are needed to be <br>
memorize so that you could also position the middle layer as well as <br>
performing the last edge and orienting the middle edges all in one <br>
move.  Which would finish the cube.  My guess is somewhere around <br>
56.  Is that right?<br>

WELCOME....

you came to the right place....we got people here that do corners 
first method in under 20 seconds, as well as people who use the 
fridrich method in under 20. And other people who use corners first, 
or fridrich, or a different method (like me) and are under 30....

I use sorta a Lars Petrus/Fridrich hybrid method that I put together.-

start by making a 2x2x2 block, expand to a 2x2x3 block (just like 
Lars does), (F2L on top two layers) then I do a corner edge pair, 
then the last top layer edge, and the last corner edge pair....then i 
use a 2 look LL like the Fridrich method.....
my pb is 20.29....best avg is 27.7

<br>
I think on average corners take me just under 10 seconds.  On a good <br>
run it will be as low as 5s and a bad one will be 13s.  My best <br>
average for the cube is 26.3 seconds just last week.  It would be <br>
much slower in front of people though . . . but I am working on <br>
that.  <br>

&gt;Hello, I&#x27;m new to this site but not to the cube. I was wondering if<br>
&gt;anyone was using the corners first method as opposed to the layers<br>
&gt;method. I&#x27;m stuck at around a 33sec average with the corners first<br>
&gt;and have been learning the Fridirich method. I have learned the algs<br>
&gt;for the F2L but can rarely do the just the F2L in under 20sec. I was<br>
&gt;wondering if anyone here averages sub 30 with corners first ?<br>

id say around 500 
120 for rooming (2 nights holiday in @ $60 each)
Plane tickets cant be more than 150 each way. you dont need first class
or anything..
I doubt my parents would let me go. but if I got a ride one way they
probably would.

Sigh. I want to go, but my parents will only let me go if I pay for 
the trip myself, and it&#x27;ll cost most likely around 1000 dollars.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, there is a good chance.
I will be working at a summer camp next summer and A LOT of the other
staff members are from Canada, mainly montreal and Toronto. If I can get
a ride with a counselor from Toronto, I can go. But I&#x27;d probably miss
the first day, I think that camp ends the day of the 23rd, the first day
of the competition. I wont be competiting, but instead watching, and
maybe trading some of my custom puzzles. I really hop i can get there.
If I can get there, I have no problem paying for the flight home to New
York.

I said on the chat room for this group when I was over in England 
for the recent bank holiday that I wanted to raise the level a bit - 
I got a new cube in England to replace my slack one - which I gave 
away (also the colour scheme on that cube was the other way around). 
My 5x5x5 had a sticker missing so I am going to paint it to avoid 
the give away of a missing sticker. Unfortunately it is really hard 
to get the colours here on the IOM. I got a blue and a white that 
were reasonable. I picked up lime green and peach (the closest I 
could get to orange - but it is light) yesterday and scarlet (the 
closest I could get to red today). Still need a yellow but there&#x27;s 
nothing close. There&#x27;s lemon (very, very light) or metallic brass, 
which probably would have been closer to orange or orange-brown.

There&#x27;s a glossy orange but the blue I got was matt and I don&#x27;t know 
if they&#x27;d feel different (defeating the object of blindfold cubing). 
Also there&#x27;s a Warhammer game type of yellow which looks close but I 
don&#x27;t know if that would feel different either.

None of the other art shops have anything.

I feel I have a chance on 5x5x5 now, so I hope I can get it painted 
and have a go soon. Then it&#x27;ll be progress towards the relay 
hopefully.

(What was amazing is that Newcastle were down by 2 goals.) 
I&#x27;ve got off my backside and written up the 43 new cubes for my page 
(although some of the details are incomplete, like the order that I 
did most of them and a couple of errors I made while trying to 
recall the cubes and write them down, which I generally do as soon 
as I can after I finish the attempts - also one or two missing). 
I&#x27;ve sent it to Jessica - who hosts my pages - just in the last half 
an hour or so - it&#x27;s now up to date to the most recent cubes (3 3s 
and a 4) - so I guess it&#x27;ll be up sometime soon.

I should send my times file over as well as I broke the UWR for the 
10x10x10 recently (as posted earlier on this group).

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve looked through your information on blindfold solving. I 
understand it, but can&#x27;t imagine memorizing all that information 
(even for one cube)!  How long would you take to memorize and solve 
(blindfolded) just one 3x3x3 cube?  Also, how long do you think it 
took at first (if you remember back when you started blindfold 
cubing)?

          <div class="email-content">He has put together a very detailed pdf file, which can be found at 
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf .
 It starts off at a 2x2x2 cube (well, 1x1x1 really, but there&#x27;s 
obviously nothing to do there), and works all the way up to a 5x5x5. 
However a 5x5x5 requires memorizing 94 numbers and 24 letters, so 
good luck! Start at the beginning (2x2x2), and work your way up.

          <div class="email-content">On numerous separate occasions where I have been asked to cube in <br>
front of people, I have got significicantly better than average <br>
times. The irony of this that while I am solving in front of people, <br>
my hands shake almost uncontrollably, yet somehow I solve the cube <br>
faster than average. Also, when I&#x27;m cubing at home and timing myself, <br>
I am very rhythmic and I move freely without locking up or anything. <br>
So why do I do better in front of people? I think the situation <br>
causes an adrenaline rush to my brain that makes me more aware of the <br>
cube and allows me to intuitively or subconsciously solve it much <br>
faster than normal despite the shaking of my hands. Quite odd <br>
though...<br>

You can save a little bit on the memorization (although its useful 
to remember the whole lot as a check. In this way you can get away 
with:

12 numbers for the 2x2x2 (instead of 14 or 16 - you can choose the 
orientation of the cube so that the last corner is already solved - 
then you can forget the numbers for the penultimate corner too).
35 numbers for the 3x3x3 (instead of 40 - you can save 2 on the 
orientations and 3 on the permutations - the last coming from the 
fact the permutations have the same signature).
35 numbers and 23 letters for the 4x4x4 (instead of 40 numbers and 
24 letters - the 5 numbers come from 1 centre and 4 on the corners - 
in the same way as for a 2x2x2 and the last letter is forced from 
the previous 23).
81 numbers and 23 letters for the 5x5x5 (instead of 94 numbers and 
23 letters - clearly 6 of the numbers you can save because they 
correspond to centre squares, 2 more are for non-central centres and 
5 are from the usual 3x3x3 saving and the letter works as for the 
5x5x5).

Still, it&#x27;s probably better to remember the lot of them.

(Of course, for the 1x1x1 there really is nothing to remember.)

Currently my best time for memorize and solve is 8&#x27; 57&quot;. My best 
time for solve was probably done on that cube. My best time for 
memorize (followed by a successful solve) is 1&#x27; 35&quot;, although one 
time I had 1&#x27; 8&quot; and was disturbed mid-solution (hadn&#x27;t messed up at 
the point I had to stop).

Sub 2 minutes for memorizing is good going though and anything up to 
3 minutes is probably acceptable.

For more cubes you need to spend a bit longer.

I am going to soon try to make several improvements to my technique. 
If I am successful the time should fall for the solving part.

Can&#x27;t remember. Certainly in April I wasn&#x27;t as quick as I am now. I 
did my 37th cube in late April 2002 and that was 14 minutes for just 
solving. It wasn&#x27;t a very quick attempt (at the time I was usually 
about 15 minutes for memorizing+solving) as I made a mistake and had 
to undo some moves. Also there was some pressure as I was doing it 
for a crowd of people and there were people placing bets on it 
(whether I could do it and if so how long would it take).

I&#x27;m going to work on speed at some point before next August though. 
Maybe I can take my time down a bit. I&#x27;m certainly not the fastest 
around.

this is great! I hope we can get more of the 1982 contestants to

Is Giuseppe still actively solving the cube?

2 hours 46 minutes 48.822 seconds<br>
<br>
2 hours 30 is probably a realistic target because:<br>
<br>
a) in spite of not wasting almost 700 move messing up flipping an <br>
edge like last time I still took more moves - basically I wasted a <br>
lot of time on the centres<br>
<br>
b) orange and yellow are very similar on this machine<br>
<br>
c) a little bit of time can be saved in the 50-50 situation that 2 <br>
edges don&#x27;t have to be switched (on the other hand, as was the case <br>
here, the likelihood is pretty high that at least part of an edge <br>
will have to be flipped).<br>

Recently I made a siamese 4x4 using a new method that lets me make it in

I will be making a 2x2x6 in the next few weeks though.
I made a square one hybrid like that also, but its better to have a real

That link may fail the first time you try it cos the hard disk will be

It looks like an awesome program for someone who uses the Frdirich 
system.  Would it be possible to make it so you can custom color the 
cube (like Rons cube solver) and put gray areas for parts of the cube 
to be ignored.  I noticed the user could type algs in and save them 
too i think.  I would definately use it for myself if I could custom 
color the cube for the algs, becasue I dont use the cross.

5x5s the gotta be kinda fragile.  Do pieces snap often for those?<br>
<br>
....A 2x2x6!?! Thats pretty cool! I&#x27;d like to see one of those.  Do <br>
you make 2x2x3s or 2x2x4s and if so do you have a price handy....  <br>
I&#x27;d like to get my hands on one.  I played witha 2x2x3 on that Rubiks <br>
Games Cd but that was on my brothers computer.  He doesnt&#x27; let me use <br>
it anymore which sucks.  Cause this computer, I&#x27;m using, really <br>
bytes.  <br>
<br>
This past summer I fused 2 3x3s so you can only move the F R U <br>
faces.  I think its called a fusion 2 cube by some but i don&#x27;t think <br>
a set name is made.  Those are fun as well, but mine kinda sucks <br>
cause it was only my first one and used glue.  I need to find a <br>
better way to stick em together.. hehehe.  <br>

3.  Place the middle V&#x27;s.  <br>

those arent mine, but mine are the same

Oh, by the way. The Siamese 4x4 and 5x5 arent fragile at all. They are
rock solid, and I actually tested the strength of them once. I bashed
the center with a hammer (between the 2 cubes, putting all the pressure
on the part that bonds them) and nothing happened!

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s quite tricky indeed to develop an algorithm to find the shortest 
solution. When I was doing this experiment, I started with a program 
which generated all possible situations and searched for the shortest 
solution using iterative deepening (which means, searching depth 
first for increasing dephts). This took too much time, even on my 
PIII 1000Mhz 384MB RAM. Each case took about half a minute (times 
190080 is way too long :)). The problem is that a LOT of work is done 
over and over again when building the search tree for every case. 
Then I developped a smarter algorithm, which starts with a solved 
cube and then does iterative deepening just once from this position. 
At each depth I store the situations which haven&#x27;t already occured at 
earlier depths in a queue. The algorithm keeps doing this until the 
number of distinct cases that it meets along the way is exactly 
190080. The only thing that&#x27;s left to do is count the number of cases 
that occured at each depth. 

I hope this makes sense. I will upload the code tomorrow when I&#x27;m 
back home. I&#x27;m now working on someone else&#x27;s computer and I don&#x27;t 
have the source code here. I will also try to explain it more clearly.

Thanks for your comments. It&#x27;s easy to add color customizing, I&#x27;ll do 
it very soon. But for the gray areas, I will have to disable the 
solving options because of code compatibility. I&#x27;ll think of what I 
can do for this.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s hard to be sure that a solution is the shortest. Even with this 
algorithm :

For every permutation (ijkl) of (1234) And m=1,2,3,4
  Place edge i in position m
  Place edges j,k,l in there respective positions
Next permutation

and take the shortest move (96 possibilities fixing the centers), I&#x27;m 
not sure of the result. Right now, I&#x27;m averaging 6,78 moves wich is 
too much (but maybe there are some bugs in my code).

dont forget another one of the main methods....corners first.

oh yeah, we are still very active.   On Saturday and sunday you can 
find some of us in the chat room (there should be a link on the left 
side in the main group page).  you came to the right place to learn 
how to speedcube!

I think when I bought my first cube it was on the way home from a Ski <br>
trip.  This was more than a year before i got into cubing i think.  I <br>
had about a 5 hour ride home, and we were at a mall in Pueblo <br>
Colorado.  I found a cube in one of the stores and thought it would <br>
give me something to do on the way home.  So I got it, and messed <br>
with it most the way home, in about a week or 2 I think I was able to <br>
solve the f2l a couple times using some layer by layer method(i <br>
didn&#x27;t look at the hint book)...but I had no idea on the LL so i <br>
pretty much gave it up......<br>
<br>
The next year I went on the same ski trip and again, I got a cube at <br>
the mall, this time i figured out how to decode the hint book.  I <br>
would solve the first layer on my own, then use the book for the <br>
middle layer edges, and i couldnt understand the LL very good, so i <br>
kept working at it, and the next day i finally did the right <br>
combination and solved the cube.......the rest is history.<br>

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s been a Rubiks Cube in my house pretty much since I was born. 
I got sort of interested in them when I was about eight, and I 
solved it when I was ten( I think it was a lucky case though. ;). It 
wasn&#x27;t until a year later when I found my dad&#x27;s Rubiks Cube booklet 
(The Simple Solution to the Rubiks Cube), and I memorized that 
solution. I thought I was pretty good then, but my average was about 
2.5 minutes. The solution in that book is really bad, and almost 
useless for serious speed cubers.
I found all the websites on the internet about the Cube later that 
year, and then I learned Lars Petrus&#x27; way. Now my average is 
something like 45 seconds.

<br>
For me I remember the cube when I was very young.  I still remember <br>
the day when my mom was mad with me when I too (like everyone else) <br>
took the stickers off to fix the cube.  The cube to me was an <br>
impossible puzzle from when I was young to about a year ago.  But <br>
recently it all started when I got a new cube for Christmas in 2000.  <br>
It was my freshman year in college, and because of my studies I threw <br>
it aside.  Then a year ago this month I picked it up after a soccer <br>
game (that I won) and thought to myself, I can do this.  So after <br>
about an hour of playing with it, and only able to get one layer <br>
done, I looked for help on the Internet.  After much search for a <br>
solution that seemed easy, I found one, and started following the <br>
steps.  Not much later I had a finished cube.  When I was done, I <br>
thought to myself, &quot;There is no way I can memorize this.&quot; <br>
But after <br>
having my brother mess it up, and me trying to fix it again, and <br>
again.  I soon memorized it.  It wasn&#x27;t until last Christmas that<br>
I <br>
actually started trying to speed-cube.  From that day on I have been <br>
totally addicted.  Anyway that&#x27;s my story.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well there was a market downtown, I guess I was about 12 then. Me and my sister went there and I &quot;won&quot; a cube at this game. Basically what I did was to fish after stuff. A man in front of the fishgame thing would ask me which of the prizes I wanted the most, and I said a cube and a man behind it put a cube on the hook and I fished it out. Veeerry exciting. Anyway I was too scared of messing it up so much I couldn&#x27;t solve it in the beginning, but eventually of course it got scrambled, and I couldn&#x27;t solve it. It didn&#x27;t come with a solution booklet and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. So it just stayed in the shelves, collecting dust for years with a few occasional attempts to &quot;finally solve it&quot;, which were unsuccessful of course, I started looking on the internet. I stumbled upon Lars&#x27; site, and frankly I didn&#x27;t understand anything. Next I found another one with a very simple layer by layer method, which I learned. And I got interested in speed cubing and managed to average 1 min 30 with this method and this crappy cube. Now, 3 months later I have a new cube of course. But I still got the old one. It&#x27;s so loose every single corner piece can be moved in its place. When I get a lockup and keep turning the pieces can go so far apart it looks like I can fit a second edge piece in there. It&#x27;s probably gonna fall apart soon :)

          <div class="email-content">I was in sixth grade or back in 1995-6.  My great aunt brought over a <br>
box of my Dad&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s stuff.  In it was... suprise suprise... a <br>
cube.  My uncles got into the craze in the 80&#x27;s.  Know none of them <br>
can solve the cube or even owns one.  So that left me without any <br>
referances.<br>
In about eight grade I figured the cube is probably easier than it <br>
appears if i just applied some simple logic.  I developed a system, <br>
almost like lars&#x27; method.  But still I couldn&#x27;t complete the final <br>
layer.  My Freshman year 1998-99 I decided to chech the net for help <br>
with the final layer.  I found four algs, and adapted them to <br>
complete the final layer.  <br>
<br>
R2 D&#x27; U2 SR U2 SR&#x27; D R2<br>
<br>
(SR U)4 (SR U&#x27;)4<br>
<br>
R&#x27; U L U&#x27; R U L&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
<br>
R&#x27; D R F D F&#x27; U&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R U <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t remember where I found the above.<br>
After apllying these four moves with a somewhat Lars begining, I <br>
could solve the cube in 3 - 5 min.  This was too slow so I changed to <br>
a layers method.  This got my times down to 1 min.  <br>
<br>
Now I do the F2l and a 3 look LL.  <br>
<br>
I think i did pretty good coming up with my own solution.  It is much <br>
harder to do when you don&#x27;t use the net or any sources but i got <br>
pretty far using an inefecient method for my first years in cubing. <br>

On a ferry either to or from Denmark - early 80&#x27;s (probably 83 or 
84). Solved it 6 times on the ferry (average solving time was pretty 
slow then - solving times were probably up to half an hour) but not 
for quite a while afterwards. It was much easier on the first day 
than later on - perhaps naivety, youthful abandon and beginner&#x27;s 
luck played their part. I still have that cube.

stores that sell cubes).  It is fun to see reactions of people, the <br>
same &quot;stupid&quot; comments.  I also like making it look like anyone can <br>
solve a cube.  Most people think they aren&#x27;t smart enough to solve <br>
one.  But out in public being my stupid self really encourages others.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I probably taught or helped a good dozen people.  Out of that 12 or <br>
so 2 are die hards and we get together and cube often.  They probably <br>
taught several people as well.  One person I helped make in school, <br>
made copies of the notes i wrote out and was handing them out to <br>
people.  So just from me it probably spread down to 20 - 30 people!!! <br>
It&#x27;s great!!!  At this rate everyone will be solving in time for the <br>
competition hehehehe!!!!<br>
It&#x27;s good to find someone to share info with, instead of keeping it <br>
all to yourself and trying to keep it some secret.  Sharing with <br>
others open up new options and solutions as well as competion and <br>

It does not really bother me at all to cube on the bus.  Anyway, people in <br>
Oxford just seem too polite / reserved to make any comment at all.  The only <br>
remark I have ever (over)heard was from a four-year-old, who asked his <br>
mother &quot;What is that man doing?&quot;  I would have given him a cube to play <br>
with, but the mother seemed so embarrassed by the whole thing that it seemed <br>
more prudent to not say anything at all.  Strange, eh?<br>
<br>
If someone on the bus is watching me solve it it feels no different.  It is <br>
not until I have a friend looking on with stopwatch in hand that I start to <br>
get the shakes, etc. etc.<br>

Yeah, I know the shakes!  I can solve in a decent time even when I have the<br>
shakes but if I tried in public, like on a bus, I&#x27;d feel under more pressure<br>
and I&#x27;d get worse times.<br>

There&#x27;s a shop here in England called Globe, The Discovery Store.  They <br>
always have them things and there is always a broken spike.  I normally <br>
manage to get the ball out by spiraling the ball out.  I&#x27;ve always <br>
wondered if that&#x27;s not possible when there is not a missing spike!<br>
<br>
While we are a bit off topic:<br>
<br>
There are two doors guarded by two people. One person always lies and <br>
the other always tells the truth.  One door will bring you certain <br>
death and the other door will bring you good fortune.  You can only ask <br>
one question to get you through the correct door.<br>
<br>
What do you ask?<br>

Ask to one of the gaurds: &quot;What would the other guard answer if I would ask him which door brings you death&quot;. The guard will always point you to the door which brings you good fortune. Just think about it and you&#x27;ll understand :)

&gt; <br>
&gt; There are two doors guarded by two people. One person always lies <br>
and <br>
&gt; the other always tells the truth.  One door will bring you certain <br>
&gt; death and the other door will bring you good fortune.  You can <br>
only ask <br>
&gt; one question to get you through the correct doors <br>
&gt; What do you ask?<br>
<br>
Well, while we are off topic, here is another one I really like:<br>
<br>
Two friends meet after many years. They talk and then ask about <br>
their children. One guy says: &quot;I have three children.&quot; The other <br>
asks: &quot;How old are they?&quot; The first one says: &quot;If you multiply their <br>
ages, you get 36&quot;. The other guy thinks for a while and says: &quot;Well, <br>
I do not know how old they are. Can you tell me more?&quot; The first guy <br>
points to a building nearby and says: &quot;If you add their ages, you <br>
will get exactly the number of windows on that building.&quot; The other <br>
guy thinks for a while and then says: &quot;Well, I still do not know <br>
their ages.&quot; The first guy adds more information: &quot;The oldest one <br>
wears glasses.&quot; The first guy smiles and says: &quot;OK, now I know how <br>
old your children are.&quot; Do you know their ages, too?<br>
<br>
If you happen to know this one, please, do not spoil the fun by <br>
posting the solution. It is a cute problem.<br>

P.S.: BTW, the cage or the spiky ball do not look like there is <br>
something hidden in them. I still am not convinced that one cannot <br>
remove the spiky ball just by twisting and turning. BTW, this type <br>
of puzzle is very famous in Czech Republic. We call it &quot;Hedgehog in <br>

I love those puzzles where you need to get the ball out, or when you 
need to get the two objects apart, etc. Unfortunately, i have no idea
about that one.
Since we&#x27;re all asking logic puzzles and stuff that&#x27;s off topic, try 
this one:
A man without eyes
saw plums on a tree.
He did not take plums,
and he did not leave plums.
How can this be?

umm ok, since it asked if I knew their ages too.  I would say the 
answer to the question is &quot;no&quot;. lol am i anywhere close?, because we 
dont know how many windows are on the building.....i have no idea 
what the oldest wears glasses has anything to do with it.

so??????

This is not a tricky question at all. And the fact that you do not <br>

1*3*13 is 39.....so its not right,.........i agree about the glasses, 
but it would have to mean the kid would have to be old enough to wear 
glasses..but i&#x27;ve seen some pretty little kids wearing glasses.

maybe if noone figues it out in a couple days i&#x27;ll email jessica for 
the answer...hopefully we dont have to do that though.

Ok... this might be safe.   The real answer is in the glasses saying..<br>
<br>
The oldest one wears glasses<br>
           ONE<br>
Meaning there is more than one one and in a multiplication of the <br>
three ages<br>
36 the son<br>
1 and the 1 with glasses could be grand childeren twins or really <br>
late sons<br>
so 36 1 1 would be my answer<br>

too will tell you the correct path.  Obviously, this leads to an <br>
endless loop of answers, IE  which way would you tell me if i asked <br>
you which way would you tell me if i asked you which way would you <br>
tell me... etc ad infinitum.  Here&#x27;s a slight modification to that <br>
logic puzzle:<br>
<br>
There are 2 paths, guarded by THREE people. One leads to fortune, the <br>
other horrendous doom, etc.  ONE person can only tell lies.  Another <br>
can only tell the truth.  The last person, will sometimes tell the <br>
truth, and will sometimes tell lies.  You have only THREE questions, <br>
and you have absolutely no idea which person you are talking to.  How <br>
can you find the correct path?<br>

          <div class="email-content">While were moving in tangents....<br>
<br>
Well, I have seasonal allergies, some of you might be plagued as <br>
well, and August and early Sept are the primal worst days of it all.  <br>
Instead of going with perscription medication, but being a big tough <br>
guy I thought i would tough it out this year. Of course i proved <br>
myself wrong.  Any way I&#x27;m taking Benydryl just normal over the <br>
counter stuff, and that stuff totally wipes me out.  <br>
To get to the point, I have been sleeping very well.  And during this <br>
period of sleep I have again been dreaming crazy dreams.  I have had <br>
some weird cubing dreams in the past (virtual cube popping out of <br>
disc thingy, and the infamous pop while on a roller coaster).<br>
Anyway I have been having weird dreams again but none of them are <br>
about the cube or anything.  I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m typing this stuff <br>
but I&#x27;ll keep you all updated on any weird cube dreams.  <br>
<br>
How have your dreams been lately?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I used to love all these little tricky questions, unfortunately I know<br>
the answers to almost all of them, so I won&#x27;t add to the discussions<br>
here, but I would like to pose two of my favorite questions in the past<br>
36 years (I don&#x27;t remember much when I was inside my Mom&#x27;s womb). One is<br>
simple yet tricky, the other is downright agonizing but can be figured<br>
out.<br>
<br>
1) Three men walk into a motel and ask for a room. The desk clerk says a<br>
room is $30 so each man  pays $10 towards the cost. Later, the clerk<br>
realizes he made a mistake, that the room should have been $25. He calls<br>
the bell boy over and asks him to refund the other $5 to the three men.<br>
The bellboy, not wanting to mess with a lot of change dividing the $5<br>
three ways, decides to lie about the price,  refunding each man $1 and<br>
keeping the other $2 for himself. Ultimately each man paid $9 towards<br>
the room and the bellboy got $2, totaling $29. But the original charge<br>
was $30, where did the extra $1 go?<br>
<br>
2) In front of you are 12 pearls, 11 being real and one fake. The real<br>
ones all weigh the same and the fake one differs in weight from the real<br>
ones (may weigh more or less). With a balance scale and three weighings<br>
how can you weed out the fake one and determine whether it is too heavy<br>
or too light?<br>
<br>
Enjoy, and no blurting out answers until some discussion...<br>

I have that puzzle, and yes it is possible to get the ball out with 
juts twisting. A little clue: not all the legs are the same length.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt;Well, while we are off topic, here is another one I really like:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Two friends meet after many years. They talk and then ask about<br>
&gt;their children. One guy says: &quot;I have three children.&quot; The other<br>
&gt;asks: &quot;How old are they?&quot; The first one says: &quot;If you multiply their<br>
&gt;ages, you get 36&quot;. The other guy thinks for a while and says: &quot;Well,<br>
&gt;I do not know how old they are. Can you tell me more?&quot; The first guy<br>
&gt;points to a building nearby and says: &quot;If you add their ages, you<br>
&gt;will get exactly the number of windows on that building.&quot; The other<br>
&gt;guy thinks for a while and then says: &quot;Well, I still do not know<br>
&gt;their ages.&quot; The first guy adds more information: &quot;The oldest one<br>
&gt;wears glasses.&quot; The first guy smiles and says: &quot;OK, now I know how<br>
&gt;old your children are.&quot; Do you know their ages, too?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;If you happen to know this one, please, do not spoil the fun by<br>
&gt;posting the solution. It is a cute problem.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Jessica: I had not seen that one before, but I really enjoyed it! ... my <br>
thoughts below (possible spoiler, so don&#x27;t look if you don&#x27;t want to!  I <br>
have posted what I think is the answer, I hope that&#x27;s ok...<br>
.<br>
.<br>

.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Eight possible answers:<br>
<br>
<br>
age     multiply   add<br>
1,1,36 = 36        = 38<br>
1,2,18 = 36        = 21<br>
1,3,12 = 36        = 16<br>
1,4,9  = 36        = 14<br>
1,6,6  = 36        = 13<br>
2,2,9  = 36        = 13<br>
2,3,6  = 36        = 11<br>
3,3,4  = 36        = 10<br>
<br>
The point of the windows questions is that after being told that he *didn&#x27;t* <br>
know the answer.  For this to be so, it must have been one of the sums that <br>
gives you more than one possible answer.  There is only one sum with that <br>
quality: 13.<br>
<br>
So the ages are either 1,6,6 OR 2,2,9.<br>
<br>
But we know that there is an eldest one, so that means that 1,6,6 is not <br>
possible, because there are two who are 6 yrs old.<br>
<br>
So the answer must be 2,2,9<br>
<br>

Well, Hamley&#x27;s in Regents Street.<br>
http://www.hamleys.co.uk/<br>
That&#x27;s possibly the best toy shop you&#x27;ll ever visit!  However I don&#x27;t know<br>
that they definitely do have cubes.  Hamley&#x27;s is very famous, you should<br>
have no trouble getting directions.  It&#x27;s in the middle of the curve between<br>
Oxford Street Tube station and Piccadilly Circus.  Look for the flags!<br>
<br>
Not far from there is a gadget shop called &#x27;The Gadget Shop&#x27;.  Got that?<br>
http://www.gadgetshop.com/<br>
That&#x27;s in Oxford Street and it&#x27;s the big one from their popular chain.  I&#x27;ve<br>
seen Oddzon cubes in some of The Gadget Shops, but again I don&#x27;t know if<br>
that one will sell them.  The shop is located between Oxford Street tube<br>
station and Tottenham Court Road, it&#x27;s on the north side of the road on a<br>
junction and once you roughly in the vicinity, someone should be able to<br>
tell you where it is.  Look for the pinky purlply neon sign!<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t think of any shops that definitely-definitely sell them I&#x27;m afraid<br>
but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll have fun in those shops anyway!<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; 1*3*13 is 39.....so its not right,.........i agree about the glasses,<br>
&gt; but it would have to mean the kid would have to be old enough to wear<br>

&gt; <br>

Well I&#x27;m thinking that because an older son is mentioned as wearing glasses,<br>
it&#x27;s just a way of mentioning that there is an older son!  I.E. There are<br>
not two older twins and one younger brother.  Still doesn&#x27;t get me anywhere<br>

The four bars of the cage are not arranged in a square. Two of the 
bars are slightly further apart. Once you have found which ones, the 
rest is just fiddling about till it works.

<br>
I was saying last night about waking up from a dream and having the solution<br>
to a problem.  These dreams are called &#x27;lucid dreams&#x27; and you have them<br>
whilst in REM.<br>
<br>
The British magazine, New Scientist, published an experiment written by an<br>
American doctor.  Readers had to come up with the solution to a problem and<br>
send them in with a description of how they came up with the solution.<br>
Eleven readers had odd dreams that gave clues as to the answer.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s see how you guys do, and again please don&#x27;t ruin it by posting the<br>
answer straight away.  (unless you put a warning and a big gap like some of<br>
you have)<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the problem:<br>
Construct an object comprising of four triangles using only six lines of<br>
equal length.<br>

My my Jessica, you really seem to have started something off here!  I guess <br>
it goes to show that the sort of people interested in speedsolving tend to <br>
share a range of other interests as well.  I wonder what they are ...<br>
<br>
<br>

It is really easy but some people get a mental block (pardon the pun) and<br>
they only come up with the answer in their dreams.  They dream of things<br>
quite like what you have mentioned and at the time it doesn&#x27;t seem to mean<br>
anything.  Then they wake up and everything becomes clear!<br>
<br>
So, if you can&#x27;t come up with that answer, perhaps you should sleep on it ;)<br>

&gt; Eight possible answers:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; age     multiply   add<br>
&gt; 1,1,36 = 36        = 38<br>
&gt; 1,2,18 = 36        = 21<br>
&gt; 1,3,12 = 36        = 16<br>
&gt; 1,4,9  = 36        = 14<br>
&gt; 1,6,6  = 36        = 13<br>
&gt; 2,2,9  = 36        = 13<br>
&gt; 2,3,6  = 36        = 11<br>
&gt; 3,3,4  = 36        = 10<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The point of the windows questions is that after being told that <br>
he *didn&#x27;t* <br>
&gt; know the answer.  For this to be so, it must have been one of the <br>
sums that <br>
&gt; gives you more than one possible answer.  There is only one sum <br>
with that <br>
&gt; quality: 13.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So the ages are either 1,6,6 OR 2,2,9.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But we know that there is an eldest one, so that means that 1,6,6 <br>
is not <br>
&gt; possible, because there are two who are 6 yrs old.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So the answer must be 2,2,9<br>

Here&#x27;s one for you, Jessica, and anyone else.  I know we are *completely* <br>
off the topic, but this is one of my own favourite puzzles.  Maybe we can <br>
swap more at Toronto.  :-)<br>
<br>
You are in a ten-story house, and are on the bottom floor.  On the top floor <br>
is a room with three electric lights (your normal light bulbs).<br>
<br>
Now each light has a switch that turns it on/off, but these switches are on <br>
the ground floor.  You know that the switches are all off, but you do not <br>
know which switch is connected to which light.<br>
<br>
Now becuase you have been speedcubing for 16 hrs straight, you are feeling <br>
very tired: so how do you establish which switch is connected to which light <br>
using the switches down stairs and only ONE walk up all those stairs? (the <br>
lift is out of order)  You cannot see the lights from downstairs, its too <br>
cold to go outside, and the top floors have no windows anyway.<br>
<br>
Post answers a few screens down, so that people can have the satisfaction of <br>
solving it themselves if they want to!<br>

My problem is that I know so many logical puzzles that I rarely <br>
encounter one that I do not know. I know this one, Simon :) I like <br>
it, too!<br>
<br>
BTW, I have one very beautiful puzzle that is not so well known but I <br>
cannot post it here because I might offend somebody ... I tried to <br>
reformulate it to some other human activity so that it is publishable <br>
but I was not able to do it. I am very interested not whether or not <br>
you solve it (I know you will), but how to reformulate it to make it <br>
less objectionable. Everybody, e-mail me if you are interested :) It <br>
could be something quite practical for you, guys, btw ... ;)<br>

Because you can only go up the stairs once, you can only be sure of 
one light/switch connection based on sight - use the sense of touch 
for a second one.

Before I walk upstairs, I would turn on two lights, leave them on 
long enough to heat up, turn one of them off and go upstairs.  The 
one that is still on matches up with the switch that is still on.  
The one that is not on, but is warm (or hot) matches up with the 
switch that was turned on and then off.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; 1) Three men walk into a motel and ask for a room. The desk clerk <br>
says a<br>
&gt; room is $30 so each man  pays $10 towards the cost. Later, the clerk<br>
&gt; realizes he made a mistake, that the room should have been $25. He <br>
calls<br>
&gt; the bell boy over and asks him to refund the other $5 to the three <br>
men.<br>
&gt; The bellboy, not wanting to mess with a lot of change dividing the <br>
$5<br>
&gt; three ways, decides to lie about the price,  refunding each man $1 <br>
and<br>
&gt; keeping the other $2 for himself. Ultimately each man paid $9 <br>
towards<br>
&gt; the room and the bellboy got $2, totaling $29. But the original <br>
charge<br>
&gt; was $30, where did the extra $1 go?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2) In front of you are 12 pearls, 11 being real and one fake. The <br>
real<br>
&gt; ones all weigh the same and the fake one differs in weight from the <br>
real<br>
&gt; ones (may weigh more or less). With a balance scale and three <br>
weighings<br>
&gt; how can you weed out the fake one and determine whether it is too <br>
heavy<br>
&gt; or too light?<br>
<br>
Jason, those are cute little problems. Unfortunately, I know them <br>
both ;) I know one more about scales and boxes that is much less well <br>
known with very difficult non-unique solution. I will post it later.<br>

You flip the first switch, then wait a while. Then you flip another 
switch, and walk up the stairs. Whichever lightbulb that&#x27;s on and is 
the hottest is the first one, whichever one that&#x27;s on but isn&#x27;t as 
hot is the second one, and whichever one is off is the last one.

Haha, I know this one...
Do you also have the book &quot;Mannen i hissen, och andra problem för

Ask each person the same question you proposed for the other 
puzzle: &quot;Which way would you tell me to go if I asked you which way 
was fortune?&quot; Two of the people will point to the correct door. The 
liar will lie about his lie, pointing to the correct door.  The 
truthful person will tell the truth about his truthful answer, 
pointing to the correct door.  The third person will potentially 
point to either door, but at this point, it doesn&#x27;t matter.

Three doctors are about to inspect a patient who has a dangerous skin <br>
disease. The doctors also have a skin disease, each one has a <br>
different one and all three are different from the patient&#x27;s disease. <br>
The doctors need to inspect the patient but they only have two gloves <br>
(not pairs, just a sigle glove twice). All four diseases are not <br>
fatal if you only have one, but if you happen to have any two of <br>
them, you die immediately. The disease spreads by physical contact. <br>
How will all three doctors inspect the patient so that they do not <br>
infect each other and all four stay alive?<br>

I can get 8 triangles with 6 lines of equal length (all equilateral, 
2 sets of congruent triangles, one having 2 triangles and the other 
6 a quarter of the size of the larger triangles, plus you get a 
regular hexagon as a bonus).

Who&#x27;s going to do the manipulation with the gloves and not die 
though?
Why does the patient need a third opinion, especially in this life-
endangering situation?
I can only imagine they aren&#x27;t in the UK - in the winter we 
sometimes run out of (or at least very short of) emergency beds 
throughout the entire country so we probably don&#x27;t even have 2 
gloves to spare.
If the gloves are shaped like Klein bottles, I guess there is no 
solution.
On a similar topic, if you make double sided sticky tape into a 
mobius strip what is it then?
Other possibilities, do the inspections require physical contact. 
Why can&#x27;t they use something other than gloves and is it important 
that they are rubber?

Sure, I can think on a platonic level but I can get 8 triangles 
instead of only 4 - surely that&#x27;s twice as good?

<br>
tut tut Dr.C  you&#x27;re just being plain greedy with your eight triangles.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s a good one:<br>
<br>
1. There is a 5 house terrace and each house is a different colour. In <br>
each<br>
house lives one person, each from a different country.<br>
2. The 5 owners each like a certain drink, smoke a<br>
certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet.<br>
3. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or<br>
drink the same beverage.<br>
<br>
The Brit lives in the red house.<br>
the Swede keeps dogs as pets.<br>
The Dane drinks tea.<br>
The green house is on the left of the white house.<br>
The green house&#x27;s owner drinks coffee.<br>
The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.<br>
The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.<br>
The man living in the centre house drinks milk.<br>
The Norwegian lives in the first house.<br>
The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.<br>
The man who keeps the horse lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.<br>
The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.<br>
The German smokes Prince.<br>
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.<br>
The man who smokes blends has a neighbour who drinks water.<br>
<br>
The question is, who owns the fish?<br>
<br>
<br>
You won&#x27;t need to add up or read between the lines or think outside of <br>
the cube for this one.  All the evidence is there, so just use plain <br>
logic!  This took me about 15 mins and I found a spreadsheet quite <br>
handy.  Have fun!<br>

The man didn&#x27;t have EYES, he had one eye. He saw two plums, he took 
one, meaning he didn&#x27;t take PLUMS, he took one. He didn&#x27;t leave 
PLUMS, he just left one.

Yes, I think a number of people got that one right.

Each doctor uses one hand to inspect the patient.

One doctor wears both gloves on one hand and examines.  This <br>
contaminates the outside of one glove and the inside of another.  The <br>
next doctor uses the outer glove which has a clean inside and has <br>
already touched the patient once it may as well again.  The last doctor <br>
takes the inner glove from the first doctor but wears it inside out and <br>
puts the outer glove on it again!<br>

Hello Peter,<br>
<br>
You seem to have caught us all in an off topic frenzy, it&#x27;s not <br>
normally like this.  I suggest you visit the chat room tomorrow to talk <br>
to people that will help you.  Also, you should visit Ron&#x27;s site, <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/ to get some starting points.  Can you do <br>
the Revenge (4x4)?<br>

Hi Peter, 

I solve the last layer bottom edges in the last step. 
If you can solve 4x4x4 layer by later, you can figure out how to 
solve 5x5x5. 
My solution for 4x4x4 can be applied for 5x5x5. 
Try Step 7.

          <div class="email-content">Most people can solve two layers without help. If you can do that, 
then you just need to memorize about five or six sequences of moves. 
You can find complete solutions to the cube all over the internet. 
Try the links at http://www.speedcubing.com and you might want to 
look at my site: http://www.geocities.com/rubiks81 It&#x27;s not very 
good, but it&#x27;s okay.

A Pocket Cube as in a 2x2x2?  They&#x27;re often hard to turn by nature of <br>
the mechanism which will keep jamming.  You should lube it but there&#x27;s <br>
not much more you can do.  I would advise never to force it though! It <br>
might fall apart and they are a bugger to put back together.  Imho, <br>
it&#x27;s best to use minimal force and sometimes jiggle to complete turns.  <br>
I have a giant 2x2x2 which is not a Rubik brand, it&#x27;s stiff but it <br>
doesn&#x27;t jam.  I can tell that a lube would make it excellent.  So it <br>
just goes to show how different cubes can be.<br>
<br>
If you are talking about a mini 3x3x3, they are not as easy to <br>
manipulate because they don&#x27;t have springs on the centres.<br>

I suggest this page. No previous knowledge required. Just imagine how the cube is divided into pieces and how the center pieces are stationary and follow the instructions *CAREFULLY* you should do fine. These two methods are no good for speeding though so if you want to learn a speedmethod, you need something like Lars or Jessicas or a corners first method.

The old 2x2s were made with a ball in the center with little disks 
coming out.  It was a nice skeleton because it is the only one I&#x27;ve 
seen with springs for a 2x2.  They turned nice and all

Each has 2 &quot;n&quot;s too. One has 2 &quot;l&quot;s and the other 2 &quot;k&quot;s. &quot;l&quot; and &quot;k&quot; 
are next to each other in the alphabet.

Of course John and Abraham are of rather different lengths. Doesn&#x27;t 
the disparity count against your theory or do you just ignore those 
results.

You would hope so.

13 is the smallest size of subgroup not in the cube group. Neither 
Lincoln nor Kennedy solved the cube.

You didn&#x27;t mention that both their names contain 15 letters.

I don&#x27;t think you can back up that last claim.

Yes. Neither of them kept Swedish parrots either.

          <div class="email-content">Nope. Not coincidence. Fate.
One time on a TV show, they were talking about that, and they said 
that you can find creepy things about anything, and they chose two 
random people, Martin Luther King, adn someone else. They found 
about ten creepy coincidences.
Another cool weird creepy amazing thing is this: Take a twenty 
dollar bill, and fold it in half longways, so it&#x27;s still the 
original length. then fold it in half the other way, then unfold it. 
Fold itdiagonally, so the edge of the dollar bill sets in the other 
fold. Then fold the other side diagonally again. It should look 
something like this:
|....|
|....|
|....|
.\../

But without the dots. Now look at it. On side one, is the twin 
towers burning down. On side two is the Pentagon burning down.

I was wrong! I looked over his site too quickly before. His &quot;Easier 
to Memorize Solution&quot; is actually what I use, except that I had 
reversed steps 2 and 3 (second layer edges before first layer 
corners).  In my opinion, it&#x27;s a little hard to follow on his site 
without illustrations, but it is a very easy approach to learn. Also, 
though it may not be all that great for speed, it lends well into 
learning Jessica&#x27;s approach.

how the cube is divided into pieces and how the center pieces are

fine. These two methods are no good for speeding though so if you 
want to learn a speedmethod, you need something like Lars or Jessicas

It&#x27;s hard to find a cool shop that sells cubes here in England.  At the <br>
local major mall, there is a shop called &quot;The Puzzle Store&quot;  At first, <br>
they only sold jigsaws, hundreds of them!  Then they started stocking a <br>
few little Mefferts puzzles but I can only take it that they didn&#x27;t <br>
sell enough cos they don&#x27;t even do them anymore, back to boring jigsaws.<br>
<br>
People often mention Toys R Us on here but it&#x27;s probably a different <br>
franchise to the Toys R Us here in England, cos I&#x27;ve never found decent <br>
cubes there either.<br>

          <em>From:</em> GameOfDeath2 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Today, I did the cube blindfolded whilst getting my hair cut - <br>
technically, I wasn&#x27;t blindfolded, but the cube was under the black <br>
sheet they put over so it was effectively the same. There was a bit <br>
of time pressure as I had to finish before the cut.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have a particularly clear recall of my thought processes <br>
on this cube, so I thought I&#x27;d go through it for those who are <br>
trying to solve the cube blindfolded.<br>
<br>
Initial position:<br>
<br>
Corners: 4 3 7 1 2 6 8 5, 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0<br>
Edges: 1 5 11 4 10 12 9 8 3 6 7 2, 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0<br>
<br>
(for notation see my blindfold page).<br>
<br>
First of all I fixed the orientation of the 2 corners that needed <br>
orienting - they were in positions 1 and 4 (the UFR and UBL <br>
positions).<br>
<br>
(F&#x27;U2)(R&#x27;F&#x27;LFRF&#x27;L&#x27;FBL&#x27;BR2B&#x27;LBR2B2)(U2F)<br>
<br>
Then I oriented the edges: first the ones in positions 9 and 11 (FR <br>
and BR). I rotated the whole cube so that the (true) R side was on <br>
top and the (true) U side was behind (i.e. in the usual places of <br>
the U and B faces respectively). Then I did <br>
<br>
FsUF&#x27;U&#x27;BsLFL&#x27;F2URsF2LsUF2 (these are not the true Fs etc., but Fs <br>
etc. with respect to the current orientation of the cube - similarly <br>
throughout).<br>
<br>
I returned the cube to its original orientation then rotated so that <br>
the U face was behind and the B face on top before doing<br>
<br>
(U&#x27;)(FsUF&#x27;U&#x27;BsLFL&#x27;F2URsF2LsUF2)(U) to correct the orientation of the <br>
edges in positions 2, 6 (UB, DB).<br>
<br>
I did the same thing with the U face behind and the L face on top, <br>
i.e. <br>
(U&#x27;)(FsUF&#x27;U&#x27;BsLFL&#x27;F2URsF2LsUF2)(U) to correct the orientation of the <br>
edges in positions 4, 8 (UL, DL).<br>
<br>
To finish off the orientation I did the same thing with <br>
the U face behind and the F face on top, i.e. <br>
(U&#x27;)(FsUF&#x27;U&#x27;BsLFL&#x27;F2URsF2LsUF2)(U) to correct the orientation of the <br>
edges in positions 1, 5 (UF, DF).<br>
<br>
Then I rotated so that the U face was on top and the B face behind <br>
again (i.e. usual position).<br>
<br>
(U2)(RaU2Ra&#x27;Fa&#x27;U2Fa) placed corners 1, 3 and 4 and put corner 7 <br>
(DBR) into position 2 (UFL).<br>
<br>
With the B face on top and F face behind,<br>
<br>
F&#x27;LF&#x27;R2FL&#x27;F&#x27;R2F2 placed corners 5 and 8 (DFR and DBL).<br>
<br>
Still corners 7 and 2 (DBR, UFL) needed to be swapped.<br>
<br>
With the cube in its proper orientation, <br>
<br>
(B2)(L&#x27;BL&#x27;F2LB&#x27;L&#x27;F2L2)(B2) placed corner 7 at the expense of corners <br>
1 and 2 needing to be switched.<br>
<br>
To switch those corners, I rotated the cube so that the U face was <br>
still on top but the F face was behind and used <br>
<br>
U&#x27;L2DF2D&#x27;L2B2D&#x27;R2DB2<br>
<br>
before restoring the cube to its proper orientation. This had the <br>
effect of also switching the edges in positions 1 and 2 (i.e. edges <br>
5 and 1).<br>
<br>
Next, I cycled the edges 11, 3 and 7 (in positions 3, 9 and 11) with <br>
R face on top and B face behind using L2U&#x27;BsL2FsU&#x27;L2 (this was a <br>
little inefficient, I should have used U instead of U&#x27;). The <br>
intention was to cycle 9 into place and simulatneously place edge <br>
11, but then I would still need to place several other edges which <br>
would have been easier the other way.<br>
<br>
This was followed by (in proper orientation) U2R2U2R2U2R2, placing <br>
edge 1.<br>
<br>
Again with R face on top and B face behind <br>
L2U&#x27;BsL2FsU&#x27;L2 placed edge 3. This got edge 11 back into position 9 <br>
for the 3 cycle I alluded to earlier but now edges 1 and 3 were <br>
placed and 7 would be placed as a bonus.<br>
<br>
Then, still with R face on top and B face behind <br>
R2UFsR2BsUR2 placed edges 9, 11 and 7.<br>
<br>
With L face on top and B face behind, <br>
<br>
(R&#x27;)(R2UFsR2BsUR2)(R) placed edge 2, completing the first layer. <br>
Of course, some Rs could be cancelled here, saving time, but its <br>
easier not too, in terms of keeping focused.<br>
<br>
Still with L face on top and B face behind, <br>
<br>
(L&#x27;)(L2UBsL2FsUL2)(L) placed edge 5.<br>
<br>
Still with L face on top and B face behind, <br>
<br>
(L))(L2UBsL2FsUL2)(L&#x27;) placed edges 6, 12 and 10, completing the <br>
cube.<br>
<br>
Finally, I restored the cube to its proper orientation (i.e. with my <br>
chosen U face on top and F face in front) and waited for the haircut <br>
to finish, which was probably no more than 2 or 3 minutes.<br>
<br>

They saw me take the cube under and there was loud clicking so they 
new what was going on - no other customers.

The barber thought it was amazing but it was just one cube.

Whenever I get a new cube, the little plasticy film things start to 
peel immediately. I either paint it, or I put vinyl film stickers 
on, but the worst part is that I can&#x27;t turn the cube fast because 
it&#x27;s soo loose!
I got this one off the net, where can I find a good one?

IMHO, I believe that Oddzon make the best NEW cubes.  You can get far <br>
better ones if you buy an old one though.  I bought a cube off Ebay, <br>
from the esteemed cuber, Dan Knights.  I&#x27;d also recommend speaking to <br>
Dan Gosbee (DanG), I&#x27;m sure he can supply you with the goods, or at <br>
least point you in the right direction.<br>

I&#x27;m still third place for the youngest. If she doesn&#x27;t come to the 
championship, then maybe I&#x27;ll win youngest person.

OK, this is what my friend, Sophie came up with.


What she said has got nothing to do with Rubik&#x27;s Cube!!
she says &#x27;greetings for all the young polish people living in 
POland and in
the world. Vikki&#x27; (wikusia is an abreviation of Victoria).

where did u get it from???

Sophie



I hope that is of some use to you all!

(R2UFsR2BsUR2)^3 (Fs=FB&#x27;, Bs=BF&#x27;)

will turn the centres on the U and R faces a half turn.
Do this again but with the L face on top and the U face on the R and 
the net effect will be to turn the centres on the opposite R and L 
faces by a half turn.

I&#x27;m sure there are quicker ways to do this, though. It&#x27;s possible to 
do them individually too.

Also, sometimes you might get them turned only by a quarter (there 
has to be an even number of those).

  (R2UFsR2BsUR2)^3 (Fs=FB&#x27;, Bs=BF&#x27;)

  will turn the centres on the U and R faces a half turn.
  Do this again but with the L face on top and the U face on the R and 
  the net effect will be to turn the centres on the opposite R and L 
  faces by a half turn.

  I&#x27;m sure there are quicker ways to do this, though. It&#x27;s possible to 
  do them individually too.

  Also, sometimes you might get them turned only by a quarter (there 
  has to be an even number of those).

Sort of a highly incomplete Jessica Fridrich version - I can&#x27;t 
remember all the algorithms to do the full thing.

I also have a square-1. I haven&#x27;t looked up any hints for it and was 
able to do the whole thing except for a few pieces in the last layer -
 managed to get the whole thing into a cube shape to0. I was pretty 
happy about getting this far without any help, but then I lost 
interest in it and never ended up finishing the last little bit. Not 
sure why. No puzzle has been able to capture my attention in the way 
that the classic 3x3x3 has. :)

I think skweb and minx puzzles are so much more in the vein of cubes though.<br>
Plus, we chat about these puzzles, not sell them.  Did you see the marble<br>

1.30ish but I havent touched it for at least a couple months.  If you 
need help let me know.  I also have a 5x5 and those are fun, but I&#x27;m 
still awaiting a megaminx that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.  I&#x27;ll have to send

anyway... Enjoy! sounds like you&#x27;ll be having a blast!

I solved it the first time I tried.

A 5x5x5 isn&#x27;t really that much more difficult than a 4x4x4.

No problems there; the corners and edges of the megaminx can be done 
independently. i.e. it is possible to solve one without (ultimately) 
changing the other (although obviously at intermediate stages it is 
likely to be changed).

What are you saying here?  You can change one edge without affecting any<br>
other edge and you can change one corner without affecting another corner?<br>
Or are you saying that you can change any edge without affecting any other<br>
corner and visa versa?<br>
<br>
Also, there are pairs of edges that are the same on the 6 colour minx.  Does<br>
this pose a problem?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Provided you don&#x27;t solve the 3x3x3 cube using a corners first method, 
the megaminx will not be much different until you get to the last 
face. Even then, it&#x27;s just a matter of knowing (or figuring out) how 
to approach it - I do it in four steps:
1) orient edges
2) position edges
3) orient corners
4) position corners
Also, some of the algs are going to be a bit different.

As far as difficulty, I can solve my megaminx faster, on average, 
than my master cube, much less a 5x5x5 (which I&#x27;ve never actually 
been able to try, aside from computer versions).  However, I have to 
admit that while my my minx moves very well, my master cube isn&#x27;t 
very well broken in.  I&#x27;ve lubed my 4x4x4, but it still doesn&#x27;t move 
very well.

Anyways, I think what makes the megaminx difficult (or at least time 
consuming)is the challenge in looking for pieces. I&#x27;ve never tried a 
5x5x5, but with my 4x4x4, I know the main reason I can&#x27;t go faster 
isn&#x27;t because of time wasted looking for pieces - it&#x27;s mainly the 
difficulty of moving the puzzle.  Consider this:
- On a 5x5x5 cube, the center pieces are on one of only 6 faces. The 
edge pieces are on one of only 12 edges, and the corners are in only 
one of 8 corner positions.
- On a megaminx, the edges are on one of 30 edges (or 2, if you have 
a 6 color minx) and the corners are in one of 20 corner positions.  
Additionally, if you have a 6 color minx, every corner has a semi-
twin; they share colors, but not in the same orientation. Also, there 
is a potential parity problem - you&#x27;ll have to swap two identical 
edges to fix it.  Depending on how far along you get in your solution 
(and how your solution goes), you may have to redo a considerable 
amount of the puzzle (I don&#x27;t personally know of any algs for a minx 
that affect only the edge pieces).

I&#x27;m saying that the edges can be solved without affecting the 
corners and vice versa. The permutations are all even (because face 
turns are 5 cycles of corners and 5 cycles of vertices - in the cube 
they are 4 cycles of corners and of vertices so the permutations can 
be odd). It follows, since the alternating group is generated by 3-
cycles, that if you can do a move which just 3-cycles corners then 
you can permute the corners without affecting the edges. Similarly 
if you can do a move which just 3-cycles edges then you can permute 
the edges without affecting the corners. Both types of move exist.

Furthermore you can flip 2 edges without doing anything else and you 
can twist 3 corners without doing anything else.

Using conjugation, it is straightforward to see that you only need 
to have one 3-cycle algorithm for corners, one 3-cycle algorithm for 
edges, one algorithm to flip 2 edges and one algorithm to twist 3 
corners. (You need that the group is 2-transitive on the corners and 
2-transitive on the edges, but that&#x27;s not so hard.)

It follows that the corners and edges can be solved independently - 
this isn&#x27;t always the case in the cube.

The centres can be twisted independently too.

That marble thing was pretty cool, but he shouldn&#x27;t advertise it or 
try to sell it. If he said something like:
I found a new puzzle! Click here to see it!
Then it would be better.

subjective.  Judging from the sites on the Fridrich method it seems that 
more people do F2L with the cross underneath than on the top or on the side.

When I began learning F2L I started with the cross on the bottom.  After 
learning the main algs I suddenly realized that working with the cross on 
the side would be equally fast, and maybe, for me, faster. (Especially for 
algs where the corner / edge pair are not touching, and the corner cube has 
the cross colour facing up.) But at that stage I was not thinking about the 
looking ahead part, and I reckon that cutting down on the looking/thinking 
part is more important for getting F2L times down than executing algs 5% 
faster.  And for me looking ahead feels more natural with the cross on the 
bottom than on the side.

Good luck Adam!  I would be interested to know what you decide to do, and 
how you find F2l comparing with corners first.  I have been learning F2L for 
a while, and have only recently started to get a glimpse of its true speed 
potential.  It seems to me that to get F2L times down you need to be able to 
look ahead pretty much for the whole thing, plus have a large repertoire of 
short cuts that take advantage of the spare corners that are available at 
the start of the F2L, but not at the end.

Hi Jess, <br>
<br>
Thanks for the Timer. It&#x27;s really nice. Better than mine. <br>
<br>
I wish you could add something else. <br>
<br>
#1 beep sound just before timing. (must help to know when we should <br>
start. )<br>
<br>
#2 Change colors of timer during inspection (minus) and timing <br>
(plus). (ex. red during inspection, blue during timing; samething as <br>
#1)<br>
<br>
#3 Could you please expand this for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5? <br>
It should be easy for you just expanding random algs for 40 and 60. <br>
and plus r, l, f, b, u, and d!<br>

This looks really good, Jess.  I have a small problem though!  It&#x27;s the <br>
same problem as I have with Ron&#x27;s timer.  The numbers on the clock <br>
don&#x27;t show through the bounding box correctly, it crops them off.  On <br>
your timer it&#x27;s the left part of the time that&#x27;s cropped off.  This <br>
only affects the current time though, the rest is excellent and works <br>
perfectly!<br>
<br>
By the way, I&#x27;m on a Mac.  Need I say more?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all.  I wanted to post to this group to thank the speed cubing <br>
community for having such a great net presence!  I thought it might <br>
be fun to share how I recently got interested / obsessed with <br>
learning to speed solve, so...<br>
<br>
I was in elementary school when the cube came out, and learned <br>
the &quot;Simple Solution&quot; from the book, a basic layer by layer approach, <br>
as I&#x27;m sure you know.  So I somehow kept that knowledge alive and <br>
well for the intervening 15 years or so (!) and then I went to a <br>
great baseball game a while ago...  It was the Giants game when Barry <br>
hit number 600, and it was 80s night, so they gave away Gaints-themed <br>
Rubiks cubes to the fans!  This was a picture cube with pics of 4 of <br>
the players!  So I showed off to my friends that I could all-but-<br>
solve it (the only problem being the final orientation of the <br>
centers).<br>
<br>
So the next day I hit the web, found a site that had the moves to <br>
rotate centers on a picture cube, and in the process found all the <br>
speed solving sites.  That sounded pretty darn cool to me, so I tried <br>
learning Lars&#x27; method first, but found it too different from the way <br>
I was used to.  So then I found Jessica&#x27;s site, and ever since I&#x27;ve <br>
been memorizing alogrithms!<br>
<br>
So much thanks to everyone who has a solver site out there, <br>
particularly Lars, Jessica, and Dan Knights, and whoever that was <br>
with the picture solver site!<br>

yeah, hang in there on those algs and make sure you learn them so <br>
they fit your hands, and you can do them with finger tricks...(in <br>

<br>
if you ever have any questions about moves or any aspect of the cube<br>

the weekends a few or more of us members can be found in the chat <br>

the megaminx I just got from mefferts has 6 colors.  On mefferts.com 
you can get the 5x5x5 in either white opp yellow, red/orange, 
green/blue....OR, white opp. blue, yellow/green, red/orange.  the 
tiles stick out....the tiles look like they would stay on fairly 
well, if not then a little super glue would hold them on :D......on 
my minx, some of the stickers were already coming off in the 
package...im going to have to use some super glue or something to 
get them to stick.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m glad to hear I&#x27;m not the only person that has trouble gettings 
answers from the Mefferts.  I once got an e-mail from them saying 
they thought they had responded, but since &quot;we get over 100 e-mails 
per day, ...&quot; I guess they skipped mine.  So, your e-mail may have 
gotten lost in the mix.

Anyways, I got a megaminx from Meffert&#x27;s store, back when it came 
with tiles.  Mine is (was) 12 colors.  I would assume they still are. 
>From the picture though
(https://www.megasecurestores.com/mefferts.com/images/puzzles/new/mega
minx-l-stickers.jpg), it looks like there are two yellow faces that 
aren&#x27;t event directly opposite.  I suppose that one may have been 
made special for the picture, though (don&#x27;t know why they would, 
but ...).

For the 5x5x5, they have two color schemes these are the pairs of 
opposite sides:
1) White-Yellow, Green-Blue, Red-Orange
2) White-Blue, Green-Yellow, Red-Orange
(Taken from http://www.mefferts.com/index_noflash.html)

Again, from the pictures 
(https://www.megasecurestores.com/mefferts.com/images/puzzles/new/prof
cube-blue-l.jpg and 
https://www.megasecurestores.com/mefferts.com/images/puzzles/new/profc
ube-yellow-l.jpg), it looks like these are your two color scheme 
options (Putting Blue on the U face):
Option1 - D=Green, F=Red, B=Orange, L=White, R=Yellow
Option2 - D=White, F=Red, B=Orange, L=Yellow, R=Green

As far as whether or not the tiles stick, not really.  So far I&#x27;ve 
gotten 2 tiled puzzles from them - a 3 color assembly cube (haven&#x27;t 
used it much, so the tiles haven&#x27;t come off) and a 12 color 
megaminx.  At first, quite a few of the megaminx&#x27;s tiles had come 
off, so I decided I would take them all off and reglue them with 
super glue, but after doing one face (11 tiles), I realized how long 
it was going to take (121 tiles to go), and now I just reglue as 
necessary.  I would guess I&#x27;ve probably had my megaminx for 1 1/2 
years, and have reglued at least half of the tiles (but I do put a it 
through a lot of use).  I asked them about this, and they claimed 
that they recently (probably 1/2 - 1 year ago now) had to make their 
glue weaker to abide by new toy safety laws.

Two different replies on this then - that makes things difficult.

Now I&#x27;m in a conundrum as sticking either stickers or tiles back on 
will not likely be uniform and therefore will compromise my 
blindfold attempts.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, this is my first time posting here.  I have just bought the cube <br>
a month ago, but since then I have been completely enamored <br>
with it.  I currently am solving it using the Petrus Method with a <br>
best time of 1:05, still trying to break the one minute mark.  <br>
Anyways, I found on the website that all the listed trigger are <br>
made for the left hand since that is apparently what Lars uses to <br>
solve it.  I was wondering if there&#x27;s an easy conversion to right <br>
hand (since that&#x27;s what I use) or whether I basically have to find <br>
my own triggers.  Any help would be appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If I&#x27;ve had a bit of a practice then about a minute, otherwise more 
like 70-75 seconds.

I should explain a few things at this point. These times are using an 
old inefficient layer-by-layer-by-layer method that I learned many 
years ago. I know this method is crap, so I&#x27;ve been working on 
learning the Fridrich method for the F2L. I&#x27;ve pretty much learnt the 
moves, but they are not yet in my subconscious (ie. I have to think 
about what I&#x27;m doing) so I don&#x27;t actually use them when demonstrating 
speedcubing for people. I&#x27;m sure my times will improve when I&#x27;ve got 
the Fridrich F2L stuff in my subconscious.

As the for LL, I&#x27;m currently using a combination of some algorithms I 
learnt many years ago plus a few Petrus LL algs.

Using the stuff I&#x27;ve been learning recently it still takes me a few 
minutes because I have to think about the steps.

While I&#x27;ll always think that the cube is probably the best puzzle 
ever invented, I&#x27;m not a must-cube-for-hours-a-day person. There are 
times when I cube a bit everyday, and there are periods when I don&#x27;t 
cube for weeks or months at a time.

  HI Dan,

  The cube is $9.99, shipment is $8.00, my proffit is $1. This cube 
  will be shiped directly from Hungary. Good for you (Dan) that you can 
  get the cube that cheap. I hope you can handle all the buy requests.

  I just offer the cube to all you guys as cheap as possible using 
  online payment services.

Are all you guys talking about exactly the same cube?  None of you are <br>
in UK, so the shipping cost changes things for me.  I&#x27;d rather pay more <br>
for a good cube in Europe if the shipping offsets the extra cost for <br>
the cube.  Common sense really.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A studio cube is a real Rubiks Cube with the old 1980 logo from 
Hungary, suitable to make it a speed cube. It has vinyl stickers and 
screws under the center cap. The rubiks.com cubes have poor sticker 
quality, but I believe the are or will be replaced. And the new 
Rubik.com (Oddzon) cubes do not have any screws under the center, so 
you can not fine tune the tension. So in short the Oddzon cube is 
fine, but a Studio Rubiks Cube from Hungary is better. You would only 
need a speedcube is your average is near 30 Seconds. Else you can 
only gain little time because of the best material.

I prepare the cubes for Ron van Bruchem, he as an avergae of 17 
Seconds. I gues even with a bas cube he will be fast e.g. 17.5 
seconds. But if you want the best you must make your own speedcube.

The best cube however are the 1980 Arxon Rubik&#x27;s cube, but you would 
need a new unused one to make it a speedcube. But this is a 
collectable.

Thats all

That&#x27;s what &quot;Crisp&quot; cubes sound like. Remember though, it isnt as loud
as it is on the vid.
In this vid the cube is 1&quot; away from the camera&#x27;s mic.
That&#x27;s my favorite cube. its better than any rubik studio cube. I think
its English. Wokinham Berks I think. (Thanks dan, for recommending this
kind of cube)
The cubies are hollow yet it turns better than any studio I&#x27;ve ever had.

2. next stretch the cube<br>
   I like to use plastic gift cards, old drivers liscense, phone <br>
cards, etc... <br>
<br>
I stick the cards in between the pieces <br>
Put cards in vertically on F and B<br>
             Horizontally on R and L<br>
         and = on U and D<br>
THis usually works well if you let the cube sit for awhile or cycle <br>
the cards around from = to || <br>
WARNING: some oddzon cubes begin to pop after too much stretching!!!<br>
<br>
3. Remove every piece from the cube and lube each piece and skeleton <br>
with silicon.<br>
Wait untill silicone is dry before reassembling cube.<br>
<br>
4. Next i like to spin each side independantly and then do all slices <br>
for awhile.<br>
<br>
This works pretty good for me.  Don&#x27;t try stretching mefferts cubes <br>
or cubes without any springs, they like to snap the centers off.<br>
<br>
Again this is how i do my cubes, I think its the best way to break in <br>
an oddzon cube, but thats just me<br>

Well, I could count the amount of times I&#x27;ve solved it using my toes.  <br>
That&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve solved it using my toes, I might add.  My little <br>
one gives me RSI, I only figured out two algs to solve it and it could <br>
take me anywhere from 5 mins upwards to solve.  It&#x27;s so funny how it <br>
moves though.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve splashed out on the full size one.  <br>
Hopefully I can improve my fingering that way.<br>

Using my two home grown algs, I got 1:40 this afternoon.  I hope I can <br>
get faster when the full size one turns up!  My method goes like this:  <br>
Fix four corners on bottom.  Use 4 move alg to fix last four corners <br>
(may need to be used a few times!).  Use 12 move alg to fix centres <br>
(again, may be needed a few times!).<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, I can&#x27;t get my head around the Skewb Diamond at all!  I <br>
know it&#x27;s the same as the Skewb (corners are equivalent of faces of <br>
Skewb, etc).  Just need to work on it some more I suppose.<br>

24 h = 1440 min
1440 min / 1500 cubes = 1 cube per 57,6 sec
And good luck eating :-)
Who´s the sucker that´s going to do the scrambling all day and all 
night?

          <div class="email-content">Are you actually going to use 1500 cubes or have someone scramble the 
same ten all day.

This actually sounds fun!  A buddy and me wanted to try and solve 
3000 cubes in two days to break that old record.  But we figured we 
didn&#x27;t have the money to buy 3000 cubes or enough money to bribe 
someone to scramble cubes for two days.  Would Rubik&#x27;s or Guiness 
help fund an event like this?

Sounds like a good idea. I&#x27;m going to have a go, starting within the 
next few minutes (maybe at 10 past 6), at doing 20 (or maybe more) 
5x5x5s in an hour on oinkleburger. Since it logs all the times it 
should be possible to check instantly whether or not I made it.

Wrists are probably going to be OK but I&#x27;m not getting paid for it 
so I guess it&#x27;s a case of no pain, no gain.

Are you using lubricated cubes?  If your arms are going to get sore, is 
there any chance that using lubricated cubes would help?  I know that you do 
not usually use any for your speed cubing, but have you considered it for a 
marathon like this one?

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Using my two home grown algs, I got 1:40 this afternoon.  I hope I can<br>
&gt; get faster when the full size one turns up!  My method goes like this:<br>
&gt; Fix four corners on bottom.  Use 4 move alg to fix last four corners<br>
&gt; (may need to be used a few times!).  Use 12 move alg to fix centres<br>
&gt; (again, may be needed a few times!).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Funny thing is, I can&#x27;t get my head around the Skewb Diamond at all!  I<br>
&gt; know it&#x27;s the same as the Skewb (corners are equivalent of faces of<br>
&gt; Skewb, etc).  Just need to work on it some more I suppose.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I took delivery of my first full size Skewb and instantly my <br>
times plummeted!  I can get down to about 40 seconds and I know that <br>
this time tomorrow I&#x27;ll have got it down some more :]<br>
<br>
I also got a Skewb Ultimate, but there is a loose piece of plastic <br>
inside.  It still works but I&#x27;m not happy about the rattle, anyone else <br>
get a rattle?<br>
<br>
AND!  I got a Pyraminx with loose tiles in the packing :[  Worst of <br>
all, there is a tile that has been glued on so wonky that it overlaps <br>
another tile and stops it from turning.  I emailed Mefferts yesterday <br>
about it and they didn&#x27;t reply.  I&#x27;m not happy with them, because I&#x27;ve <br>
seen postings on here about the loose tiles.<br>

To update - I got through 21 (on the 22nd when the time ran out) 
5x5x5s in the hour but I seriously messed up the LL 2 or 3 times (to 
the point of having to go back and do some of the F2L) so I think 
that 22 and maybe even 23 is possible.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m intentionally not timing myself too much right now, until I learn 
more of the algs.  BUT, I&#x27;m usually solving the F2L in 35 secs, and 
the LL in 15 when I know the orient and permute.  I&#x27;ll bet my fastest 
is low 40s.

I think the hardest part is quickly finding corner-edge pairs in the 
F2L, but I guess that just comes with practice, right?  I find that I 
can start looking for the next pair with 2 or 3 moves left to place 
the one I&#x27;m working one.  I suppose when you&#x27;re really good, you 
pretty much start looking for the next pair as soon as you start the 
move sequence to place the current one?

          <div class="email-content">I won $150 in a local high school talent show contest. My talent: <br>
solving Rubik&#x27;s cubes of course. Specifically, I solved four cubes in <br>
under such-and-such amount of time. They had me do an encore <br>
performance on an outside stage for a festival here in town. Hundreds <br>
of people watched as I solved four cubes in two minutes seven <br>
seconds. BOY did that feel great! Averaged 31.75 seconds per cube and <br>
that&#x27;s without any preinspection time of any sort. In short, this was <br>
a great experience for getting better at cubing in front of people. <br>
I&#x27;ve found that when my thoughts are going as fast as I can, I do <br>
poorly, but when I think about looking ahead, I do great. You just <br>
have to actively solve the cube. In this way, everything transitions <br>
smoothly and you don&#x27;t slow down.<br>

I&#x27;m going to use this money for A - Going to Toronto, or B - buying <br>
more puzzles...  Haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet.<br>

For those who care, I found Scotch brand colored plastic tape at an

So it&#x27;s possible to find some decent tape to use, it&#x27;s just a pain to

kewl....that scotch plastic tape is awesome!! I found the same 
stuff....too bad they dont make it in orange, i had to settle for 
colored vinyl like they use for decals on cars...the plastic tape has 
been on way longer than the vinyl stuff, and the plastic tape looks 
wayy better still.

          <div class="email-content">I recently got some puzzles from Mefferts and two of them have problems. The<br>
Ultimate has a rattle and the Pyraminx has tiles that fall off.  I emailed<br>
Uwe and he advised that I simply take apart the Ultimate and get the loose<br>
ball bearing out.  I hate taking apart those Skewb things, they are so hard<br>
to get back together :[  Anyway, I did it, but it still rattles.  There is<br>
something in one of the sealed &#x27;fixed&#x27; corners.  Can anyone advise what I<br>
should do about it?<br>
<br>
I have offered an opinion to Uwe about the tiles falling off.  Apparently,<br>
they cannot use superglue in the factory anymore.  That means for the<br>
foreseeable future, all tiled puzzles from Meffets are liable to loose their<br>
tiles.  I suggested that he should change the design so that the tiles clip<br>
in, in a secure manner.  That way, no glue is needed and also, you can<br>
change the colour layout if you prefer it your own way.  There would be no<br>
more surveys and arguments then ;)<br>
<br>
Do you think that&#x27;s a good idea?  Can anyone suggest to Mefferts a way of<br>
making tiles that clip in securely?  It would have to be designed so that<br>
the tiles sit flat with no visible clips, the tiles don&#x27;t &#x27;shift&#x27; around and<br>
they can easily be taken off with a small screw driver, say.<br>

The Mefferts puzzles are indeed flat sided for both the stickered and <br>
the tiled versions.  If they changed to clip ons, then there would be <br>
lots of mould changes, like you say.  It would be for both the puzzle <br>
pieces and for the tiles themselves.  Don&#x27;t forget though, that they <br>
currently sell two versions of the Professor, because people like two <br>
different colour schemes.  If they made clip ons, they could ship them <br>
without them even attached!  They would save money on the production <br>
line in that respect.<br>

My average is forty seconds, but there are loads of people in this 
group who have 20 second average. I hope to have at least thirty 
average when the championships comes around.

I have a 31 second average right now. I have been cubing since last 
December. I have achieved this and I don&#x27;t even practice that much. I 
hope to in one month have a consistent sub 30 second average. My 
ultimate goal at the moment is to simply achieve a low 20-second 
average. So under 24 seconds. After that, I will see if I want to try 
and strive for a sub-20 average.

I average 25&#x27; and I use Fridrich system I think it&#x27;s difficult to <br>

I&#x27;ve got another question to speedcubist:<br>
I am interrested on how many time speedcubist who have sub-20 record <br>
( like Dan(s) , Ron, Jess etc...) usually do the cube ?  19-20?????<br>
<br>
With my experience, I have calculated that you just add 2 second to <br>
your personnal record to obtain your  usually average . For exemple, <br>
for me who have a record at 25&#x27; I usually average at 27&#x27; What do you <br>

I&#x27;m averaging just under 25 at the moment, but probably I&#x27;ll do at 
least 24,5 very soon... and when I have learned all the OLL 
algorithms (maybe 20 I don&#x27;t know) I think I must be able to achieve 
sub 24 or lower.

I seldom have an average of more than 25.5, and that is because I 
think I can do much better than my avg I have now...

My goal is to be a sub-20 cuber, before the WC. Too bad I can&#x27;t 
come  to the WC (I live in Sweden and I am only 16) It would have 
been fun.

Today I made a great new record, avg 23,1! And I also solved the <br>
cube on 13,5 sec! I could hardly beleive it, when I watched the <br>
time. I was a bit lucky in the F2L, but not very much, and I had to <br>
do both LL algs.<br>
<br>
The past month I have thought myself to become faster and faster... <br>
but nothing happened to my times (usually around 25,the fastest was <br>
24.8). I was just waiting for an avg of maybe 24-24.5 any time soon, <br>
but today I was in a really good shape. I always thought that I was <br>
better than my times showed, and now I have got evidence of that.<br>
<br>
With one year to go, I am starting to think about a way to get to <br>
the WC. Hopefully, I will then have a sub-20 avg at least.<br>
Keep practising!<br>

its cool that you just started working on the megaminx.  Yesterday 
was the first time i got the nerve to mix up my megaminx.  I solved 
all but the last cap in about 25-30 mins..i&#x27;ve mixed it up and re-did 
all that i can do and solved all but the last cap 3 or 4 times now.  
I timed the last time and it wa about 7 and a half mins.  I too need 
to figure out something for the LL on it....one time i oriented the 
LL, but had no clue how to permute it.

good luck to you.

No need to surf, just keep careful notes of what each algorithm you <br>
find does to the pieces. If you spend an hour or two with a piece of <br>
paper, a pencil, and a magaminx, you should be able to find enough <br>
algs to solve it. Just think of as many ways as you can of taking <br>

Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, the parity problem affects LL edge permutation, 
not orientation.  To spot this, you should find that you can properly 
position 3 edges, leaving 2 that need to be swapped.

I don&#x27;t actually have a 6 color minx, but I confirmed this alg with 
kkrash (who does have a 6 color) when I came up with it.  It&#x27;s a 
little difficult to explain the effect, so it&#x27;s probably easier to 
just do it, and see what it does.  Make sure that U, F, L, and R are 
completely solved, and apply the sequence.  I&#x27;ll use the following 
notation:
+ = 1 click clockwise
++ = 2 clicks clockwise
- = 1 click counterclockwise
-- = 2 clicks counterclockwise
U, F, L, and R are as expected (holding a face at U, and another at 
F, L and R are on opposition sides of F, both being adjacent to both 
F and U):
L++ U- R+ F- R- F- R- F- R- F- R+ F+ R+ F+ R+ F+ U+ L--

You should see that only one edge on L, and two edges and two corners 
on R are affected.  To fix the parity problem with this, place your 
LL on R with the two edges that need to swap in the two positions 
affected (not adjacent to U).
So, to answer your original question, it takes 18 faces turns (20 
clicks) to fix the parity problem with this method.

Thats what i was thinkin about doin :)  I took my minx to school 
today and mixed it up this morning.  Most the people thought i was 
crazy to have something that looked that complex. haha. 

One of my friends who thinks he knows everything told me the easiest 
way to solve the minx would be to solve the F2L, then solve the last 
2 layers....leaving an unsolved zig zag in the middle layer.  He 
thought that once you solved the f2l and L2L that you could easily do 
the middle layer :| ....HA.  oh well, after messing with his idea for 
awhile I abandoned it....anybody else know people like that? lol

 :D

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I don&#x27;t actually have a 6 color minx, but I confirmed this alg with<br>
&gt; kkrash (who does have a 6 color) when I came up with it.  It&#x27;s a<br>
&gt; little difficult to explain the effect, so it&#x27;s probably easier to<br>
&gt; just do it, and see what it does.  Make sure that U, F, L, and R are<br>
&gt; completely solved, and apply the sequence.  I&#x27;ll use the following<br>
&gt; notation:<br>
&gt; + = 1 click clockwise<br>
&gt; ++ = 2 clicks clockwise<br>
&gt; - = 1 click counterclockwise<br>
&gt; -- = 2 clicks counterclockwise<br>
&gt; U, F, L, and R are as expected (holding a face at U, and another at<br>
&gt; F, L and R are on opposition sides of F, both being adjacent to both<br>
&gt; F and U):<br>
&gt; L++ U- R+ F- R- F- R- F- R- F- R+ F+ R+ F+ R+ F+ U+ L--<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You should see that only one edge on L, and two edges and two corners<br>
&gt; on R are affected.  To fix the parity problem with this, place your<br>
&gt; LL on R with the two edges that need to swap in the two positions<br>
&gt; affected (not adjacent to U).<br>
&gt; So, to answer your original question, it takes 18 faces turns (20<br>
&gt; clicks) to fix the parity problem with this method.<br>

I&#x27;ve messed with several different ways of solving the megaminx, in 
an effort to find the easiest and quickest method.  I&#x27;ve done it that 
way, but once you have the F2L done, the L2L becomes a little more 
complicated.  Also, the zig-zag is possible, not even necessarily all 
that difficult (just do edges first, then corners), but it takes a 
lot of moves and just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it to me.

Another method I played with is doing all edges first (all 30 of 
them) before placing a single corner.  This would make fixing parity 
much simpler on a six color minx, because you could swap two opposite 
edges in 7 moves (9 clicks), without worrying about messing up the 
corners.  However, this has the same down side as zig zag last; each 
corner placement takes many more moves than necessary.

I&#x27;ve found that the best approach (for me anyways) is a modified F2L 
and four look LL approach.

Notation always gets a little confusing, but you could easily rotate 
this to use L F and R for clarity.

At first I thought I must have done this wrong - I did it on my 
solved megaminx, and after I was done, it was stilled solved.  Then I 
realized what you meant; These algs don&#x27;t do a thing!

I used to do corner permutations differently, but yesterday I came up 
with the alg that I think you were looking for.  Try this instead (do 
it on a solved U face to see it&#x27;s effect):
L+ U+ L- F+ R+ F- L+ F+ R- F- U- L-

Also, you can replace the U+ and U- with U++ and U--, respectively, 
to rotate 3 non-adjacent corners.  The inverses or reflections of 
these can be used to rotate in the opposition direction, for example:
R- U- R+ F- L- F+ R- F- L+ F+ U+ R+

With these 4 algs (the two stated, and the ones with U+ and U- 
replaced with U++ and U--), I&#x27;m pretty sure you can always permute 
the corners in two steps.

On reflection, it&#x27;s easy to see why it doesn&#x27;t do anything!  You can remove<br>
the F moves, since they play no part in the alg anyway.  Then the rest of<br>
the moves can be contracted to R+B-R+ R-B+R-  Which of course can be<br>
contracted to no moves at all!<br>

I didn&#x27;t realize it at first, but you can use the first alg you 
mentioned with a small change.. I tried to line these up so you could 
easily see the differences.  Change it from
this    -> R+ B- R+  F++ R-  B+ R+  F-- R--
to this -> R+ B- R++ F++ R-- B+ R++ F-- R++

Basically add an R+ before each F movement and an R- after each F 
movement.

The sequence I adapted from Robert, however, used B and not U. With 
U, F, L, and R in the positions you would expect, the &#x27;B&#x27; referred to 
is the one behind R. From typical notation, R becomes R+ and R&#x27; 
becomes R-.  Does that make this clearer?

R+ B- R++ F++ R-- B+ R++ F-- R++

Jake, do you have a digital camera? I&#x27;d like to see what it looks 
like tiled. O, btw, i took care of the tile today.
I had a stickered 6 tile one once, it really bothered me, the double 
pieces screwed me up and it kept falling apart, so i never solved it 
or took interest to it, which is why you now have mine... Is it 
really that easy?

<br>
Yes!  I had no trouble at all!!  <br>
It is a very nice puzzle, I&#x27;m glad to have it in my collection.<br>
Heres what I do.<br>
<br>
One star<br>
F2L<br>
lower middle corners and adjacent edges<br>
M2L<br>
(Last layer)<br>
Flip up edges (normal 3x3 algs)<br>
move edges(adapted easily from a 3x3 alg)<br>
flip up corners<br>
move corners<br>
<br>
The last layer corners gave me the most problems because i <br>
experimented with 3x3 moves and the of course switched edges around.<br>
So I use one 3x3 alg to orientate 2 corners at a time.  Once all are <br>
up I just use a simple corner move that moves three corners.<br>
It&#x27;s not bad at all.<br>
I may play a little more trying to shorten things up, or i may search <br>
the net and see what solutions are out there.<br>

They sell cubes that make that claim in a shop here in England called <br>
Globe, The Discovery Store.  I bought one.  I have a sneaky suspicion <br>
they are made by Mefferts.  They are smooth in a way, but useless for <br>
speed cubing because they don&#x27;t have springs.  They become amazingly <br>
slippy after a dose of silicone, far too slippy if you ask me!  But <br>
then, it&#x27;s all a matter of taste  :]<br>
<br>
By the way, Mefferts make that very claim themselves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been trying to get some people at work into cubing. As I <br>
mentioned in an earlier post, I lent my 2x2x2 to someone. He&#x27;s now <br>
pretty confidently doing half the cube (ie. one layer). I know this <br>
is pretty basic to us, but it&#x27;s exciting to someone who&#x27;s never <br>
played with cubes before. Also, he&#x27;s doing it without any algorithms <br>
from me or the net. I think he wants to work it out himself. <br>
Hopefully he&#x27;ll have 2x2x2 solved soon and will be keen to start the <br>
3x3x3! :)<br>
<br>
On the topic of the 3x3x3, there&#x27;s someone at work who said he &#x27;used <br>
to be able to do it&#x27;. I&#x27;m usually skeptical when anyone says this. I <br>
mentioned &#x27;layer methods&#x27; and &#x27;corners first methods&#x27; and he said he <br>
used a corners first method and then proceeded to describe how he <br>
used to go about it (although he couldn&#x27;t remember any specific <br>
algorithms). I&#x27;m not really familiar with any corners first methods, <br>
but the way he described it sounded like either (i) he did actually <br>
used to know it; or (ii) he&#x27;d read a website about it. I reckon (i) <br>
is true. So anyway, I lent him one of my 3x3x3s yesterday. I&#x27;m keen <br>
to see how he&#x27;s going with it today!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree, meffert&#x27;s 4x4 stickers really suck..
Get a set of stickers from Rubiks.com, those are pretty nice
Meffert&#x27;s 4x4 is better though mechanically.. So you decide what&#x27;s more
important to you, mechanics or stickers.
 
As far as 5x5 goes.
The last production of Meffert 5x5&#x27;s weren&#x27;t that great, they caught a
lot.
The production from before that was good, and I bought a 1995 one and it
was amazing (new in package)
 
Rubik&#x27;s 5x5 isn&#x27;t for sale yet, they bumped it back a month. As soon as
that thing is sold ill have a review for you guys.
I prefer the mini 5x5 for playing, but its no good for speeding. For
speeding, a 1995 5x5 is the best.

yourself
then that&#x27;s outstanding!

It takes me a little longer than the time you mention.  I use the
solution
from Chris Hardwick.  I can go faster but I don&#x27;t practice enough.

What make is your destroyed 5xCube?  Can anyone tell me if the new
rubiks.com 5xCube is up to much?  Better than Mefferts?  I don&#x27;t like my
Mefferts one, it&#x27;s too catchy and flimsy.

I think these guys that are in charge of stickers all need a good slap.
Can
it be that hard to make all the stickers easily distinguishable?

Well, oinkleburger counts slice (quarter) moves as 1 move and half 
turns as two moves, so I&#x27;m on a slightly different count from you 
but I have no other verifiable data of my own to go on. (I guess the 
recent ones I could step through but I&#x27;m not doing that!)

Anyway, of 486 attempts at the 4x4x4 this year (on oinkleburger, 
real cube attempts aside as I&#x27;ve never counted my moves there - and 
also the blindfold solutions would up the number a lot) I have had 
13 that took me 200 moves or more.

The minimum number of moves was 120. The average was 164.1605 moves 
and this was also the median and the mode (21 of the cubes). There 
was only one mode. The (sample) standard deviation was around 16.63 
so that 200 moves plus is over 2.15 standard deviations away from 
the mean (which may not mean much depending on the distribution).
Of course, I don&#x27;t bother to finish every cube I start on 
oinkleburger so that could account for some distortion.

So I&#x27;m over 200 (this year) in about 2.67% of cases. A similar 
exercise on the solutions of other cubers on oinkleburger (only 
using the oinkleburger data) shows that Ron is over 200 on about 
29.47% of 285 cases and Grant Tregay is above 200 moves on about 
41.01% of 317 cases.

Of course, these are generally attempts for speed. I imagine that if 
one were to go slower the number of moves would fall a little.
In particular, I know that sometimes my number of moves is going to 
be high because I can&#x27;t orient the LL in one step all the time (in 
fact probably quite a lot of the time) and also I&#x27;m not at all 
efficient in doing the cross and one of the F2L algorithms I never 
figured out on oinkleburger as the geometry was too scary so I use 
another one which is less efficient.

So I would say that you can definitely go sub 200 moves and on a 
regular basis. Even though I probably lose on average a lot of moves 
on the 3x3x3 to a lot of people (I&#x27;d say that I probably average a 
lot closer to 70 as opposed to low 50s or better) I make up a bit on 
other areas. I think that if you can solve the centres and edges 
efficiently you will regularly dip the 200 move barrier.

Not sure about that! My times (on real cubes at least) don&#x27;t seem to 
get any better. It would help if I could take on board all the 
algorithms and had a cube which (by &quot;the Ton criterion&quot;) was 
classified as good for speed-cubing, but I don&#x27;t think I can move my 
hands or my mind much faster and so my best average of 10 is likely 
ever to lie in the high 30s and not improve even if I do practice a 
lot.

Maybe,as a result, someday I can get my average blindfold time 
(solving part only of course, in the context I am about to state) 
down to the same as my average sight time. : )

It seems like my 4x4x4 is impossible to solve, although I&#x27;m almost 
positive it&#x27;s not. What I do is I get all the centers together, then 
all the edges together, then solve it like a big 3x3x3, but then at 
the end, one edge is always incorrectly oriented. Can anyone help me?

I could be wrong but I guess most people here use Chris Hardwick&#x27;s 
moves for correcting this and for the switching of two edges 
(another possible thing that can happen).
They are particularly useful moves as they don&#x27;t affect anything 
else (assuming the centres are solved). 

In regular solving you should do it at the start of the LL. In 
blindfold solving you should do it at the end.

Chris&#x27;s other move (switching 2 edges) should be used liberally in 
blindfold cubing. For instance, if the corner permutation is odd (so 
that you are left with two corners to switch) you can switch the 
corners in a regular 3x3x3 way (switching two edges as well) and 
then switch the edges back by themselves) so that the edges remain 
unchanged from their initial state.

I totally agree that this is the reality of the situation, but 
really, we shouldn&#x27;t have to choose. If the people who manufactured

Where you say r, do you mean the single right slice or both right

This is probably the most important step. Do one centre, then the 
opposite centre. Make the 4th centre adjacent the 3rd one (Chris&#x27;  
method is opposite but I think it is not as fast).

Best to join the edges next. Then solve as a 3x3x3. Flip the edge 
(if needed) just before OLL, switch 2 edges (if needed) just before 
PLL.

>  - Fix corners parity

Not sure what you mean here. If it&#x27;s what I think it is, then you 
can just go U (or nothing at all).

>  - Fix edges parity (***)

Very uncertain here. I don&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve joined the edges yet 
(unless it is in &quot;Do edges&quot;), but then the amount of work needed to 
see if you need to swap 2 edges must be huge.

Another approach you could try which can guarantee your edges is 
centres last, but it takes a lot longer to do it this way (I used to 
do it like that myself).

On another note, it occurred to me yesterday that if one could get 
an edge 4 cycle algorithm then one could ensure that in the final 
stages one had at most one corrective algorithm to do, rather than 
perhaps two.

Such an algorithm would do something like this:

the edge pair 

B A

C D

would become

D C

B A

(of course, some centres would be altered, but with solved centres 
the effect would be unnoticeable).

Thus the algorithm would do something like:
 |&lt;  >
 | \/|
 | /\|
 v   v

(can&#x27;t quite get the arrows right at the top), which in effect would 
flip the edge and switch 2 joined edges in one step.

This seems to be the best compromise in a centres first technique 
(with unmarked centres) because without extensive planning getting 
the centres in the right place to avoid problems seems impossible to 
guarantee.

It&#x27;s just a first step to solve the parity problem. Solve the corners,<br>

Yes, maybe huge, I don&#x27;t know if there is an easy solution to this<br>

I just have to say - that&#x27;s amazing!  In order to get down under the 
40s barrier, I had to learn way more than 8 algorithms.  I&#x27;ve got 
about 40 algorithms down, now, and I&#x27;m still struggling to get under 
35 seconds.  (Although some of the algs are still a little shaky)

You don&#x27;t need algorithms for the first 2 layers and the cross
(standard method or Petrus&#x27;). Just use the force, Luke. Then, 2
algorithms for corners permutation, 3 for corners orientation
(1+optimizations), and 3 for egdes permutation. Averages 63 moves, &lt;30
seconds.

For the cross, there aren&#x27;t really any algs you could use - there are 
way too many possibilities.  I can think pretty well through most of 
the 41 F2L situations, but for 7 of them, I really needed 
algorithms.  For the LL, it looks like you skipped edge orientation 
(I&#x27;m guessing you use Lars&#x27; approach), so I orient in 2 &quot;looks&quot; (3 
algs for edges, 7 for corners), and permute in 1 look (21 algs).  
Unfortunately, the time I spent working on LL algs so far hasn&#x27;t 
really seemed to improve my time much - most of my time is lost on 
the F2L.

I think you&#x27;re actually on a winner here.  If you have to think your way<br>
through the F2L algs but you can do them pretty quick, then in the long run<br>
it&#x27;ll be better for you.  Once you get that time down by practicing, you&#x27;ll<br>
be in a better position to look ahead.  If you get a chance to glance at the<br>
pieces before you commence an alg, then you might also get the chance to<br>
know where they&#x27;ll end up (or one piece maybe?).  Then you&#x27;ve got a head<br>
start on the next alg.<br>
<br>
Remember though, going really fast in the F2L can work against you!  Take it<br>
easy, watch the pieces move, predict, plan ahead.  It&#x27;ll work better that<br>
way.  Then, for the LL, go for it as quick as you can!<br>
<br>
I know my times are nothing amazing, but the going slow on F2L still makes a<br>
difference to me.<br>

Well, you can permute them afterwards at the end of doing the corner 
permutations (in the last step) if necessary, which is what my old 
system did but the new system is going to be much better.

In 4x4x4 blindfolding there really isn&#x27;t an issue here.

Centres last is not the way to go, if you want speed, mainly because 
it is difficult to switch many centres in one go without messing 
stuff up.

Chris&#x27; solution is not bad for the most part. We differ a little on 
getting the centres - I think I save some moves here - and probably 
on the edge building. I do think it would be good to have a 3rd 
algorithm for the end that combines the effect of the other 2 (a 4 
cycle of edges as I noted in an earlier post).

In any event, for bigger cubes, the centres are the thing that eats 
up the time as the number of centres is quadratic in the cube size 
and the number of edges is only linear in the cube size. Corrections 
are also linear in the cube size and then the ordinary solution is 
of constant order. It follows that doing the centres efficiently 
must be the most important thing for large cubes. I imagine thre is 
some effect even on rather small cubes. Already on the 4x4x4 the 
number of centre pieces is equal to the number of edge pieces.

I&#x27;m at about the same exact place as you. Average is about 42, 
record is 32. I only know about ten bottom layer algorithms, and I 
don&#x27;t plan to learn any more.

I have spent alot of time learning the LL algs and still only rarely 
break 30 sec. Recently I have gone back to the corners first learning 
the algs to place and oreint the second layer corners in one alg and 
I&#x27;m breaking 30 more often. Corners first works better for me !

The biggest cubes I&#x27;ve done is just a 5x5x5.  I do agree that a 
centers last will ruin any hopes of getting good times with a 5x5, 
but then again, same as a 4x4.  At least in a 5x5 you can place a 
corner and edge center in at the same time.

Actually it&#x27;s found by use of a computer, though I don&#x27;t know how 
that&#x27;s done

          <div class="email-content"><br>
It&#x27;s pretty straightforward. First of all you need to figure out <br>
some invariants - things that don&#x27;t change if you twist the cube.<br>
<br>
The easiest invariant to find is that the corner and edge <br>
permutations will always have the same signature as permutations. <br>
That&#x27;s because a quarter twist of a face gives rise to a 4-cycle of <br>
edges and a 4-cycle of corners (both odd permutations).<br>
<br>
Another couple of less obvious invariants are the total edge <br>
orientation (modulo 2) and the total corner orientation (modulo 3).<br>
<br>
These are in fact the only invariants (and you can see this <br>
explicitly by showing that any cube satisfying these 3 conditions <br>
can be solved).<br>
<br>
It follows that the number of possible positions of the cube is <br>
equal to <br>
<br>
1/2*(12!*8!)*2^11*3^7=12!*8!*2^10*3^7.<br>
<br>
If we allow for twisting of centres as well then it is easy to see <br>
that for any position the total number of quarter turns the centres <br>
are twisted (modulo 2) is equal to 0 if the edge and corner <br>
permutations are even and 1 otherwise. Since in the solved cube <br>
(without regard to centres) the corner and edge orientations are <br>
even it follows that for a solved cube the total number of quarter <br>
turns the centres are twisted are even. In particular, an even <br>
number of them are twisted an odd number of quarter turns and the <br>
rest an even number of quarter turns. It remains to see that a <br>
centre can be twisted a half turn without affecting anything else <br>
and that 2 non-opposite centres can be twisted a quarter turn <br>
(direction unimportant due to previous part) without affecting <br>
anythin else to get the total number of positions. These moves are <br>
both possible.<br>
It follows that the first 5 centres can be in any of 4 possible <br>
twists and then the last one is confined to 2 possibilities. Thus in <br>
the larger sense the total number of positions is equal to <br>
<br>
12!*8!*2^10*3^7*4^5*2=12!*8!*2^21*3^7.<br>
<br>
In terms of finding short solutions to the cube this is an unsolved <br>
problem. There are lower bounds and upper bounds but the exact <br>
answer is not known. Even if one was to know the maximum number of <br>
moves needed to solve the cube that still wouldn&#x27;t tell us for a <br>
given position the best solution - it would only say that one needs <br>
only to search up to this maximum depth.<br>
<br>
The best solutions at the moment (as far as I know) are to use a <br>
chain of normal subgroups.<br>
As far as I&#x27;m aware the current best upper bound is around 42 <br>
quarter turns (maybe 29 half turns) but I haven&#x27;t really read any <br>
literature on it, in terms of anything outside of the results.<br>
<br>
The 3x3x3 cube has a group structure. Higher order cubes do not if <br>
we identify two positions if they look the same (in other words <br>
treat all the red centre pieces as the same etc.). In such a case <br>
they&#x27;d have more than one solved state which messes things up. With <br>
marked centres they would form a group. So the problem should be <br>
harder for larger cubes.<br>

Good job! I&#x27;ve actually never done an average timing, but if I did, 
I would probably be at about 40 seconds or so.

Seems like we have alot of people who only learn 8-12 algs for the LL 
and still average pretty fast times.

Do take a look at my theory page:
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm
It explains some of what goes on, I hope reasonably easy to 
understand.

It is possible to solve the last layer with only 4 basic algorithms! 
These need be modified only slightly to actually solve the cube. If I 
hadn&#x27;t been so lazy with them, I probably could have got pretty fast 
with them.

          <div class="email-content">I know about 40 algs for the LL but some of them I never use because 
they are the same permutation but with more turns.
Before I was only using 14.  2 to orientate edges, 6 t orientate 
corners, 2 o permute corners and 4 to permute edges

I remember being able to execute these moves pretty fast!  But know 
with a 3look LL I know more but my recognition is down.

It&#x27;s a matter of preference. The most important thing is to understand<br>
what they do, don&#x27;t learn by heart.<br>
<br>
I like the two-generator solution.<br>
<br>
Firstly, 2 layers + the cross (bottom edges orientation) (using<br>
standard or Petrus method) + corners position (LU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U&#x27;R or<br>
RB²L&#x27;DL&#x27;D&#x27;L²B²R&#x27;).<br>
<br>
And finally, one or two of the following algorithms that can be done<br>
very fast with one hand, even if they are not the shortest ones:<br>
- corners orientation: ( RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27; | inverse | symetrical ) |<br>
combinations.<br>
- edges permutation: ( R2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R2URURU2R | symetrical |<br>
R2U2R2U2R2UR2U2R2U2R2U&#x27; (6 right hand moves if done right) |<br>
R2UR2UR&#x27;U2R2U2R2U2R&#x27;U&#x27;R2U&#x27;R2 ).<br>

See the section with the square-1 Label?
Pry it off, theres a screw inside.
Chances are you will need to crack the piece off, it doesn&#x27;t easily pry,
you might ruin
The external of the puzzle. Any other construction questions, ask me or

cubing for cubing sake I did it to relax and think about my day.  <br>
After a while all of a sudden my wrist had a shot of pain to it.  <br>
Then I realized that I probably had been cubing for like 30 min of <br>
non-stop cubing, probably like 40 solves and scrambles.  Anyway that <br>
made me think, props to you, Dan on your marathon, I&#x27;m 20 and my <br>
wrists hurt only after 40 solves, I don&#x27;t think I could even come <br>
close to what you did.  Dan how did you do on your attempt, I know <br>
you did your 1500 cubes, but was it hard for you, how long did it <br>
take, did your wrists hurt after, and do you think you can do even <br>
more say 2000?<br>

Any step in your solution that is over 5 moves long that is skipped <br>

          <div class="email-content">I understand that but here is where I will disagree with this <br>
definition of luck.  For example when I solve the 4x4x4, my method <br>
runs in to a parity error half the time.  So I have a 1 out of 2 <br>
chance of skipping that stage.  The move to fix the parity error is <br>
very long.  So according to your definition I can only count the <br>
times when I ran in to the parity error, because the others are <br>
considered lucky.  Why is luck bad in this case?  I don&#x27;t<br>
consider a <br>
50-50-chance luck.  Because if one did consider that luck, then they <br>
must throw out half of their times.  Another question, how often does <br>
one have a lucky run?  Is there a probability associated with it? And <br>
if there is a probability, what is it and is it the same for <br>
everyone? How often do people think they get a lucky run?  Is it one <br>
out of 12 solves? (This would account to why we throw out one time in <br>
an average of 12)  I think that to know this probability it would be <br>
much easier for me and maybe others, to decide what is an okay amount <br>
of luck, and what is not an okay amount of luck.  <br>
<br>
I also think that we should add to your definition of luck to include <br>
the chance of skipping a stage.  For example allow for lucky cases if <br>
they come up say 1 out of five times, or more, or something like <br>
that.  I would use one out of five, because then on average it would <br>
comes up twice in an average run.  So I would add to the definition <br>
you wrote below: <br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;we will summarize a lucky case as follows: <br>
&gt; Any step in your solution that is over 5 moves long that is skipped <br>
&gt; due to the pieces already being correctly laid on the cube so as to <br>
&gt; render the step unnecessary is too lucky. (Except if you worked for <br>
 it, f.i. by anticipating the next step, or if on average the case <br>
comes up one time for every five solves.)&quot; <br>
<br>
Am I making any sense?  Or do people think that luck in the case I <br>
described above with the 4x4x4 should still be considered lucky. <br>
<br>
What does everyone think?  <br>

Yeah, the new rubiks lube is better than it used to be.  It used to be <br>
wax, which worked great while it was wet.  It was rubbish the next time <br>
you pick it up though, infact it was worse that how it started!  Very <br>
stiff, easily give you RSI.<br>
<br>
The new stuff is silicone based.  I think it&#x27;s too watery for me, but I <br>
know people on here like the spray lube which is probably much the same <br>
texture.  The stuff I use does not run, it&#x27;s a very stiff lube that was <br>
to be worked in to the cube.  Once worked in, it&#x27;s a lovely smooth <br>
action.<br>

I have found that the actual silicon lube doesn&#x27;t seem to help all <br>
that much.  I am wondering if anyone has tried using graphite as <br>
a lubricant since it generally works very well on plastics.  I am a <br>
little worried that it might make the cube a little too loose.  <br>
Anyone tried it?<br>

Doesn&#x27;t seem any easier for me, if anything I find it makes slightly 
more difficult, because you have to break L&#x27;UL&#x27;U&#x27; into two parts L&#x27;U 
and L&#x27;U&#x27; to execute it smoothly. But, it might be easier for some of 
you lefties out there ;)

See http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/2x2x6.htm

for some hints, do not use force it will break a center piece.

For a mini 4x4x4 you can remove the centercaps and unscrew

          <div class="email-content">According to my information:

All cube&#x27;s with the new Rubik&#x27;s logo are manufactured in Hong Kong 
under controle of Seven Towns and are the same -that is internal-. 
Except for the Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube&#x27;s with the old 1980 logo, they are 
produced under controle of the Hungary firm Rubik&#x27;s Studio run by 
Erno Rubik.

So the Odzonn cube is the same as the Rubiks.com cube, they new ones 
are good but not the best for speedcubing.

You can order a Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube&#x27;s for $16 including shipment 
online on my home page, they will be shiped directly from Hungary.

          <div class="email-content">I just had a major &#x27;holy cow&#x27; moment!  An almighty penny just dropped <br>
in my echo chamber of a head.  I&#x27;ve never been able to solve the <br>
Pyramorphix at will, only by half chance, it seems the most illogical <br>
and weird thing ever!  I always try to solve my puzzles without <br>
instructions if I can, and I&#x27;ve never read a solution to this.  I was <br>
just staring at it dreamily and I realised it&#x27;s just a 2x2x2 cube!  <br>
This may seem obvious to many of you, but it&#x27;s not everyday that <br>
someone like me has an insight like this!  It was like a lucent <br>
daydream!<br>
<br>
So, I decided to see if I could rotate two corners of my choosing in a <br>
desired direction.  I held it so I could see the cross sections like on <br>
a 2x2x2 cube, a clear horizontal and vertical line and a back line too. <br>
  I turned the F face clockwise, performed a Sune on the R face, then <br>
again on the L face, and finally turned the F face anti-clockwise.  HEY <br>
PRESTO!  I turned two corners!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve not done a complete scramble and controlled solving yet, I&#x27;m gonna <br>
do some more testing first.  I always understood that you aim for a <br>
pyramid shape first and then move the pieces around (a beginners <br>
method?).  From what I can see right now, it will be quicker and <br>
relatively easy to start moving pieces to the right place straight <br>
away, a pyramid will prevail by natural causes  :]<br>
<br>
Does it use a regular 2x2x2 Rubik&#x27;s style mechanism?  Is my solution <br>
vision pretty much how others do it quickly?  I can see that some <br>
orientation is unnecessary, as there are four featureless faces anyway.<br>

I&#x27;ve been searching the internet for quite some time looking for some <br>
way that I would be able to come in contact with Erno Rubik with no <br>

conducting a semester long research project on the Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube...specifically it&#x27;s history and how to solve it.  Finding <br>
information on the history of the cube and how to solve it is easy <br>
enough...there is info all over the internet as well as in text books <br>
that I have found.  What I think would be a real kicker to my <br>
project, though, would be if I were able to get in contact with Erno <br>
himself and ask him how he first came up with the idea...well just <br>
conduct an informal or formal interview with him...I&#x27;m sure it would <br>
greatly increase my chance of getting a good project grade as well as <br>
impress my instructor.  So if anyone has any information/knows how I <br>
can get in contact with Mr. Rubik, it would be very much appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
 I just came back home from meeting Jessica and now i know for sure <br>
she is for real,This girl is amazing, as a person and with a rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube in her hand, forget it about it that is (insane).<br>
<br>
I spent 5 hours with Jessica and now i&#x27;am trying to digest in my <br>
system, how good she really is; i know there is a bunch of great <br>
cubist out there which i respect, but this girl is good boys.<br>
<br>
Anyway we had some food and talk, and i did some magic tricks for <br>
her,and then i ask her to solve the cube fast for me.. I brought a <br>
timer with me and she said ok time me.. the restaurant was very dark <br>
and you could easily confuse yellow for white, green for blue, and so <br>
forth, well you gyus know that.. well she did it in (16:87 secs),not <br>
bad for such a dark place..<br>
<br>
I did some more magic tricks for her, and we talk some more,she put <br>
her cube away and show me a wonderful colletion of puzzles she <br>
have,and one of the toys she has it is a top that float in the air <br>
spining for about 5 mints, It was really great wow..<br>
<br>
2 hours later the owner of the restaurant decided that we should <br>
leave the place bcuz we were there for a long long time that is what <br>
he said, so 10 later we left and when to my gym and place where i <br>
work, i introduced Jessica to my coworker and told them about <br>
Jessica; right away they wanted to see Jessica solving the cube again,<br>
she was cold, bcuz she had put the cube away for 2 hours but she ok <br>
time me again, this time there were more light in the pool office <br>
where i work, and i time Jessica again and she did it in <br>
(14.93secs),not that bad after you have not grab the cube for over <br>
tow hours..<br>
<br>
I should add that those time were not lucky cases she went to the <br>
whole f2l,orienting,and LL, in both of then, i was very impressed, <br>
and i still am, i have never seen in person and on top of that <br>
Jessica solving the cube that fast WOW..<br>
<br>
Jessica thank you for everything and you know what Jessica you forgot <br>
all the cubes with your name and last name, maybe i will mail them to <br>
you..<br>
<br>
OK guys this is my story for the day, right Jessica is driving back <br>
to binghamton, she should getting there by 11:30, I wish she have a <br>
nice and safe drive.<br>
<br>
Jessica thanks again and you have open my head about speed cubing..<br>
<br>
Have a good evening everyone..<br>

I am really glad we finally met. And thank you for today&#x27;s wonderful 
and magical afternoon. Manolo is a great close-up magician, guys, 
and girls, in addition to a pretty fast cuber! I spent most of those 
5 hours with my mouth open in disbelief. 

It seems like magic and cube go well together. Thank you for those 
tricks!! I promise I will practice. I remembered the cubes when I 
was crossing the George Washington bridge ... Looks like we will 
have to meet again in January :)

Yeah, that 16.87 in a near complete darkness was a surprise even for 
me :) Ron, Ton, I greased one of my older cubes and it now twists 
incredibly. I instantly improved with this cube. It is somewhat 
stiffer than yours but this stiffness is optimal for my twisting 
style. Any looser and I would get stuck too often or risk a &quot;pop&quot;.

Thanks once more, Manolo, for everything. I hope our meeting will

I think there should also be a sense of proportion. For instance, at 
the moment there is only one time on the board for 17x17x17 and 
clearly it is bad (not as good as the 19x19x19 time for instance) so 
when it is broken the time will likely come down by a lot (at least 
15 minutes, say). If this time just happens to come from a solve 
where, for instance, the LL is already oriented (saving a matter of 
seconds) should it be discounted given that it would clearly have 
been well under the old time even if the LL had had to be oriented.

<br>
I&#x27;d never really thought about it this way, but you&#x27;ve got<br>
a really good point.  When you do very large cubes with a<br>
&quot;centers first&quot; method, the last several steps (solving it<br>
like a large 3x3x3 cube) take only a small percentage of<br>
the total time (and likewise of the total number of steps).<br>
Maybe the wording should include not only the likelihood<br>
that a given step is skipped, but the percentage of a<br>
solution that is skipped.  To make sure that skipping any<br>
step on a 3x3x3 would be considered lucky, the &quot;skipped<br>
portion&quot; allowance would have to be very small, maybe one<br>
or two percent.<br>
<br>
So maybe the text could change from:<br>
&quot;A lucky time is any time you solve the puzzle and a step<br>
(3 or more moves) of your normal solution is skipped. There<br>
are two exceptions:<br>
 1) You worked for it, f.i. by anticipating the next step.<br>
 2) The chance to skip the step is 20 percent or more.&quot;<br>
<br>
to something like this:<br>
&quot;A lucky time is any time you solve the puzzle and a step<br>
of your normal solution is skipped. There are three<br>
exceptions:<br>
 1) You worked for it, f.i. by anticipating the next step.<br>
 2) The chance to skip the step is 20 percent or more.<br>
 3) The skipped step represents less than 1 percent of<br>
      the total time and/or moves for your complete<br>
      solution.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this definition, I couldn&#x27;t skip any of my standard<br>
3x3x3 steps until I&#x27;m working on a 6x6x6 cube or bigger<br>
without considering it to be lucky (my good solves on the<br>
5x5x5 take less than 300 moves).  Of course this definition<br>
also has its limitations, because there should be some<br>
cumulative effect here; What if you skip multiple steps<br>
that fit the constraints?  How many skipped steps are<br>
acceptable? etc.<br>
<br>
What think ye?<br>

Thanks for your nice story. We should all meet more often. It sounds like we have many interests in common.<br>
<br>
Jessica,<br>
<br>
You should really try to do some average runs. It sounds like you&#x27;re getting back to your old shape, and maybe even better.<br>
It would be nice to see you on top of the average list. Probably at #1!!<br>
<br>
Have fun and keep on cubing,<br>

Hi Jess,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m glad to report that this is an excellent update.  Even the part <br>
where you say that you can&#x27;t get the cookies to work on the Mac...  My <br>
Mac is working fine with them.  I&#x27;ve set my Mac to alert for all <br>
cookies and I have done many tests.  Every time a cookie needs <br>
updating, it&#x27;s working perfectly.  I&#x27;ve closed the timer and reopened <br>
and it still holds the times.  And also, the stopwatch is not clipping <br>
like it used to.  As we say in England, Job&#x27;s a good&#x27;un!<br>
<br>
For your reference, I&#x27;m running Mac OSX 10.2.1 with Internet Explorer.<br>
<br>
THANKS FOR A GREAT PIECE OF WORK JESS!<br>
<br>

Didn´t find any bugs. But do have a sugestion.
I´ve checked your coding and see that you are using a simple but 
brilliant way to trigger the countdown signal (wav file with 12sec 
pause and 3sec beep).
I tried changing the code a little (hope you don´t mind). And tried 
typing in a different filename. Which was quite fun, if you add a 10 
sec paus to a wav-musicfile. Your can start cubing when the music 
starts.
But I even tried it with a Midi-file. No problem. If you make 
midifiles instead of wav files you´ll have a much smaller &quot;applet&quot;. 
Might even work online then?
Just a thought.

Exactly. Also on the huge cubes, you&#x27;re very likely to get some good 
luck and some bad luck at some point in the centres and/or edges, 
even if it isn&#x27;t apparent. e.g. in the 20x20x20 cube there are 1944 
centre pieces. They can&#x27;t all be bad.

Difficult to say really. I think if you get a little lucky but knock 
a disproportionate amount off your time it&#x27;s a bit harsh to discount 
it completely. e.g. suppose someone does something crazy like solves 
the 20x20x20 in 2 hour but as soon as (s)he&#x27;s done with the centres 
and edges the cube is solved. They&#x27;ve save less than a minute on the 
last part but destroyed the old time. Should that last piece of luck 
really count against?

One reason I ask is that on my 6x6x6 time I came across every stage 
(including flipping part of one edge and switching 2 edges) and was 
just shy of the 4 minute barrier which is currently my focus on the 
big cubes. Clearly the sub 4 minute 6x6x6 is achievable but, despite 
my expectations that I would get there, it hasn&#x27;t yet come. If I do 
achieve it but don&#x27;t have to say put one of the edge-corner pairs in 
(yet still have to switch 2 edges and flip parts of an edge which 
would compensate more than the amount saved by the one corner-edge 
pair) what is my situation in terms of the UWR?

In fact, skipping a 3x3x3 stage will really not save much time at 
all in the framework of the big cubes. Flipping an edge (or part of 
one) or switching 2 edges take much longer.

          <div class="email-content">I thought of the exact same thing today.
The concept of live cubing on the internet :oD
Everytime you accepted a time on an online timer, it would be saved 
in a database on a personal profile.
There could be a list of best time, best average of ten, best over 
all average, etc.
I have messed a little around with asp and acces databases, but I 
don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m able to make this yet. After newyear we&#x27;re starting 
with hardcore vbscript and asp in my school and I will make this for 
sure if somebody doesn&#x27;t do it before me...
Please let me make this.

<br>
 I want to suggest a link for you to post. <br>
http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/puzzles.html DAVID BAGLEY has put <br>
together a package of his FREE windows-based programs including a <br>
cube simulator that allows at least as high as 10x10x10 to run <br>
flawlessly on my old 486 -66mhz-24 mbRAM machine as well as pyramids, <br>
octahedra,dino, skewb,etc. all with the ability to <br>
increase/decrease &quot;layers&quot; and change from face turning to corner <br>
turning modes where applicable. These program allows you to save the <br>
current state of your cube (including all the moves done to get to <br>
that state) to a file called xxxxx.dat(can be renamed to allow for <br>
multiple save states) and reload it later to continue where you left <br>
off. worked great for my first-ever effort to solve 9x9x9,which took <br>
several half-hour sessions to finally complete(which I then saved to <br>
the &quot;.dat&quot; file,and which ,when reloaded, plays an impressive <br>
little &quot;movie&quot; as the simulator displays every single state the cube <br>
was in from start to finish in rapid-fire succession) The download is <br>
small and the functionality is UNSURPASSED !!!! BY FAR THE BEST <br>
SOFTWARE SIMULATION I&#x27;VE YET TO USE AND I BELIEVE BY FAR THE BEST <br>
SOFTWARE SIMULATION OUT THERE!!!! (DEBATABLE, I&#x27;M SURE) DID I MENTION <br>
IT&#x27;S FREE??? Try it, you&#x27;ll love it. thanks<br>

Go centres first. Do one centre, then do the opposite one. Make the 
4th centre adjacent the 3rd.
Put the edges together. Correct last edge if necessary (5x5x5). 
Solve pretty much as you&#x27;d do a 3x3x3. At the start of the last 
layer you may have to flip the edge (4x4x4). At the permutation 
stage you may first have to swap 2 edges (4x4x4).

I&#x27;m pretty sure you can get a good time like this.

<br>
I just bought my Rubik&#x27;s Cube 3 days ago.  I solved one side on the <br>
first day.  I was pretty psyched.  Solving one side is pretty easy <br>
now.<br>
<br>
I thought it would be pretty cool if I could solve the whole thing.  <br>
I looked at a bunch of web pages regarding solving the cube.  They&#x27;re <br>
all extremely confusing.  <br>
<br>
Are there any web pages or instructional material that is easy to <br>
follow?<br>
<br>
A lot of these steps, diagrams, pictures, show what moves to do when <br>
the cube is already solved.  My cube is all mixed up.  So it doesn&#x27;t <br>
help out very much.<br>
<br>
Are there any sites or books or documents which show the steps in a <br>
slow, easy-to-follow format?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi there, I am glad that you are interested in the cube!  Here is the 
site that I learned from.  I too was in your shoes about a year and 
two months ago.  I liked this site because there was no notation to 
learn (even though now that I know it, it seams very easy,) and it 
was easy to follow.  I think that with my cube in hand and reading 
this page it took me around 45 min to solve the cube for the first 
time.  Good luck, and let us know if you get it solved, and then if 
you memorize the solution.

I know what you mean, but it all depends on which method you want to learn.<br>
This is the site that I learnt from, which of course means I found (and<br>
still do find) the easiest to follow.  I suppose I&#x27;ve become biased, but I<br>
think you should look:<br>
<br>
http://www.cubeland.fr.st/<br>
<br>
Using only the moves on that site, you can average under a minute easily.<br>
It will also be a good way to start learning a complete Jessica method and<br>
get under 20 seconds.  If you want to learn some other system, hopefully<br>
someone else will have a beginners link?<br>
<br>
The moves I learnt from that site have led to me learning to do the 2x2x2,<br>
3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, pyramorphix and megaminx.  The extra moves needed for<br>
the big cubes I got from Chris Hardwick&#x27;s corner on:<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/<br>
<br>
Best leave that for later though, eh?<br>

Actually, I&#x27;ll go a bit further. I don&#x27;t think you can really be 
competitive at the highest level if you don&#x27;t do centres first. 
Centres last is a lot slower (although it makes putting the edges 
together quicker) and I don&#x27;t think it will produce stunning times. 
Your method is sort of half way between these extremes but it seems 
that you are leaving 4 centres to the end. I don&#x27;t think that can be 
efficient. You can probably get away with leaving 2 (adjacent) 
centres to the end but you&#x27;ll still lose a bit of time.

heres one of the sites I found the most useful when I started out.  
http://lar5.com/cube/ ....its easier to follow than most pages 
because it doesn&#x27;t have any confusing notation.  I dont use the whole 
method on that page. but I use the first couple steps then go on my 
own after that.  Because I thought it was easier to leave a step 
out....

maybe you could give it a try....

oh, welcome to the club and i hope ya figure out how to solve the 
cube!...

If youre a beginner, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Lars Petrus&#x27; site or 
Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s.  Thgey&#x27;re mainly for semi-experienced cubists. I 
have a site about the cube with some solutions, so you might want to 
check it out. URL: http://www.geocities.com/rubiks81

Actually for me the Petrus method have shown to be quite easy to learn and teach. I solved my first cube using the Petrus method. The first day I couldent solve it without cheating and looking at the page at least once every cube, but from the second day I had no problems at all. The problem with the Petrus method is that it require that the cubist do lots of thinking during solving instead of having a lot of memorized algs to solve everything.<br>
<br>
I have found it to be quite easy to teach in person too. Its not that hard to build a 2*2*1, and then I show how to make a 2*2*2 from it. Then getting to 2*2*3 is also no problem. Flipping edges is the part that seems to be the hardest part to grasp. Also geting in the last pices in the f2l could be a problem. Last layer is just 3 algs to memorize.<br>
<br>
It might be a bit harder than some methods but the approch made sence to me when I learned it and the good thing is that you get a top class method. <br>

That&#x27;s a frustrating one, because when I teach people in person, that<br>
is the easiest step. But when explaining it in text it becomes the<br>
hardest. I did a full rewrite a few months back. I think that helped,<br>
but it still seems much harder than it really is.<br>
<br>
&gt;Also geting in the last pices in the f2l could be a problem.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that is clearly the hardest part of it. Once you learn a few<br>
common positions and a trick or two, it&#x27;s not hard, but it&#x27;s tough to<br>
get there.<br>
<br>
&gt;Last layer is just 3 algs to memorize.<br>
<br>
I recently taught a friend, and she had some problems with the<br>
&quot;thinking&quot; parts (Steps 1, 2 &amp; 4), but she got the final 3 algs in<br>
about 5 minutes each!<br>

I&#x27;ve come up with a way to finish the F2L Lars Petrus&#x27; method that 
probably isn&#x27;t the fastest way, but it&#x27;s really simple. It&#x27;s hard to 
explain in writing, but you can see it on my site with pictures.

          <div class="email-content">I have problems with pieces popping from my megaminx all the time.
Part of avoiding this is just making sure you have the pieces lined
up right before going on to the next move (losing a couple seconds
every solve is better than popping a piece every solve!). However, I
don&#x27;t remember what it was like prior to a good silicon lubing.  In
the process of lubing it the first time, one of the screws came
loose, and I had to retighten it (and glue it in place). I have
found, though, that as the lube wears thin (and my megaminx gets a
bit harder to move again), I&#x27;m more likely to pop pieces. Right
after relubing, it always seems to be a fair amount better.

Anyway, I think music has a gigantic role in cubing.  I know we had a <br>
serious discusion earlier about music while cubing.  It certainly <br>
makes a different.  Maybe some of you newer cubers that recently <br>

you stay in a consistent pace and I think that is what helped me get <br>

Haahaha, that&#x27;s the funniest thing I&#x27;ve seen in a long time!  Another funny<br>
thing I&#x27;ve seen on the internet is grocery bag packing! (in America of<br>
course).  These guys can completely fill out grocery bags in a blur, and to<br>
prove it&#x27;s been done properly, a judge cuts the bag down the side leaving<br>
the groceries free standing.  If the bag is cut and the groceries collapse,<br>
it is deemed to be packed badly and is disqualified!<br>

In other news I&#x27;m having SO much fun with Jess&#x27;s timer! I get<br>
distracted by timing myself, writing down times, doing the Math etc.<br>
Now I just cube and press the space bar! My record so far is 21.88,<br>

that if I get my head in gear and stop being so wildly uneven.<br>

<br>
http://www.cubeland.fr.st/ uses the little applets to show the moves.  It&#x27;s<br>
very simple to get started with and has the potential to be expanded to a<br>
full blown Jessica method.<br>
<br>
As for lubing and whether a cube can become too loose, well yes that can<br>
happen for sure.  The best way to minimise poppage but have a super smooth<br>
turning cube is don&#x27;t bother sanding down the internals.  I know some people<br>
sand pieces to make them pass by each other with no catching.  It&#x27;s probably<br>
better to be patient and wear the cube in with normal use.<br>
<br>
You say you have a lot of cube dust inside your cube.  Some people will tell<br>
you that the dust alone is a very effective way to make your cube turn<br>
nicely.  It all depends on how you want it to feel.  Dan Gosbee in Canada<br>
doesn&#x27;t sand or lube or anything, he just buys in bulk and only the ones<br>
that feel good right from the box are used.  The rest are deemed as spares I<br>
guess?<br>
<br>
It sounds like your cube has been worn in quite nicely though.  So<br>
personally, I would strip it down and wash all the corners and edges in very<br>
hot water.  I just drop them in freshly boiled water and wait for the water<br>
to cool enough to pick them out.  Just use a toothbrush or something to<br>
clean the centres.  Then dry off, reassemble and use a stiff silicone lube.<br>
If the water ruins the stickers, just put new decent ones back on.  I can<br>
send you a set of stickers if need be.<br>
<br>
Other people might prefer a spray lube, but I don&#x27;t like how it runs and<br>
drips.<br>

PS I&#x27;d have to say that the stacking of cups at that speed was 
fairly impressive.

 Hi Lars,

 Yeah, I really think that magic and speedcubing are very similar.

 when i started doing magic, i went to the magic store in my area and 
bought two books one for card tricks and one for coin tricks.
 Lars it depends what kind of tricks you prefer, I like cards and 
coin tricks the most, but i also do other tricks with dollar bills 
and cigarette and more. so i would suggest that you get a book with 
over all magic and then see in which one you want to get better,then 
you can get a book that mainly specialize in either cards or coin or 
cigarette or else.. I have a few books for cards, for coins, for 
cigarette and for overall magic, close up magic i mean.

I do not remember the name of the book i have for overall magic, I 
lent it to a friend and he has not return it to me, but tomorrow i&#x27;m 
going to the magic store and i&#x27;ll get it for you..

I personaly think that books are better then tapes because you can 
get better technique by reading and reading, but it is not a bad idea 
to watch some tapes, you learn something from it too.

I will get you the name of the book, and we all going to be 
practicing magic in Toronto.


Hi every one I wish everybody is feeling well and getting ready for 
Toronto one way or another...By for now and have a good weekend 
everyone.

Just an idea - not necessarily meant as a race. Just to see if it 
could be done. You only need 4 people and there are certainly enough 
for that. Alternatively, you could have 1 person do it but with 
checkpoints, so to speak - like they have to stop at each designated 
position (and possibly end up solving it too).

As I said, I wasn&#x27;t really meaning a race - just curious if it could 
be done. My friend had suggested to me getting from one scrambled 
state to another and this was possible so I figured it was a way to 
generalize it.

It&#x27;s not as scary as the other idea I had involving scrambling 6 
5x5x5s!

True, but not many speed people do the cube layer by layer either.

You can learn some fairly good tricks for free all over the net, but 
the best ones you need to pay for. The best magic site to buy things 
from is www.ellusionist.com.

Why don&#x27;t you try to solve it on your own? I got it in about two 
weeks that way.

          <div class="email-content">Have you tried the book Conquer the Cube? It&#x27;s a bit confusing, but 
you can solve it really fast that way. If you want an easy way to do 
it, then try the book called the Simple Solution to the Rubiks Cube. 
It&#x27;s extremely easy, but it takes you about two minutes or so to 
solve it.

There are two algs you will need to know to correct parity problems.<br>
<br>
(R2r2)B2U2(Ll)U2(R&#x27;r&#x27;)U2(Rr)U2F2(Rr)F2(L&#x27;l&#x27;)B2(R2r2)<br>
<br>
Will flip one edge, this can be done anytime after the F2L.<br>
<br>
r2U2r2(u2U2)r2(u2U2)<br>
<br>
Will swap two edge pieces (or two corner pieces).  This can be done as soon<br>
as you notice it needs doing, but it messes up whatever else you have done<br>
on the LL.<br>
<br>
I hope I got this info right!  By the way, these algs are really easy.<br>
Notice that the brackets hold the same sides, so you just turn both parts<br>
the same, rather than slices.<br>

I can solve the cube on average in 20.17 seconds, and I live in 
Aurora, which as you know is a suberb of Denver.  This puts me 
anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes away, depending on exactly where 
you are.

here goes.  I wanted to hold out on this until I knew it might happen <br>

cube.  They want me to fill part of a 15 second channel break, from <br>
what I understand, doing finger tricks and showing off speed cubing <br>
techniques.  I told the guy that I can&#x27;t solve the cube in less the <br>
15 seconds reliably at all, having only done it once EVER.  He said <br>
the time wasn&#x27;t so important, just showing the method of doing it <br>

it seems like it might happen.  No guarantees that they&#x27;ll air it or <br>
anything, I just know they&#x27;re going to fly me to New York this coming <br>
Monday for the film shoot.  So anyway I&#x27;m really excited, I hope they <br>
end up airing it, even if it is only less than 15 seconds :)  So <br>
anyway I&#x27;m still in the cube scene, sort of part time I guess heh <br>
heh.  Still averaging around 22-24 seconds though :(  I lubed my cube <br>
and got some frequent 18&#x27;s and 19&#x27;s but still averaging 22-24.  I&#x27;m <br>
trying some tips I got off Jessica&#x27;s site and they help me sometimes <br>
but other times I mess it up or the cube is just like &quot;Eh...  I think <br>
I&#x27;ll hide all the pieces he&#x27;s looking for&quot; so those times are a <br>
little slower than usual :)  Anyway just letting you guys know I <br>
might be spreading the word of the cube some (hopefully more people <br>
will convert to speed cubing or just cubing in general).<br>

P.S.  The people at my college don&#x27;t seem as interested in the cube <br>

learn to do it, and I taught one of my suitemates how to solve it.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Below is a re-post, something I wrote a few weeks ago.  You probably don&#x27;t<br>
need the amount of detail that I&#x27;ve written, but I&#x27;ve also added some more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hamley&#x27;s in Regents Street.<br>
http://www.hamleys.co.uk/<br>
That&#x27;s possibly the best toy shop you&#x27;ll ever visit!  However I don&#x27;t know<br>
that they definitely do have cubes.  Hamley&#x27;s is very famous, you should<br>
have no trouble getting directions.  It&#x27;s in the middle of the curve between<br>
Oxford Street Tube station and Piccadilly Circus.  Look for the flags!<br>
<br>
Not far from there is a gadget shop called &#x27;The Gadget Shop&#x27;.  Got that?<br>
http://www.gadgetshop.com/<br>
That&#x27;s in Oxford Street and it&#x27;s the big one from their popular chain.  I&#x27;ve<br>
seen Oddzon cubes in some of The Gadget Shops, but again I don&#x27;t know if<br>
that one will sell them.  The shop is located between Oxford Street tube<br>
station and Tottenham Court Road, it&#x27;s on the north side of the road on a<br>
junction and once you roughly in the vicinity, someone should be able to<br>
tell you where it is.  Look for the pinky purlply neon sign!<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s Beatties too, a fairly big one can be found on the right of the road<br>
that goes from Centre Point towards Holborn station.  Again, I don&#x27;t know if<br>
they sell cubes for sure.<br>
<br>
I get mine from The Entertainer, outside Debenhams ground floor in Lakeside<br>
Shopping Centre.  They don&#x27;t stock many at a time and run out pretty quickly<br>
from what I can tell, but they always have a few different Rubiks Puzzles.<br>
The Cubes are Oddzon branded, which are just... OK.  Also in Lakeside, visit<br>
Globe, The Discovery Store, ground floor near centre.  They sell some very<br>
cheap cubes but they are no good for speed cubing (I really mean that!).<br>
<br>
If you want my opinion though, visit Ebay.  You can find a real cube from<br>
Hungary!  You won&#x27;t pay much for them and they have much more potential.<br>
Look for Ideal brand or Studio Cube or Büvös Kocka (?)  One such seller who<br>
I can vouch for is Andreas http://go.to/rubiks4sale<br>
<br>
I live in Essex by the way.  Nice to meet you  :]    The best cube I ever<br>
bought was from Ebay, it&#x27;s a second hand Studio cube, previously used by<br>
esteemed cubist Dan Knights who averaged 18 seconds on it.  I average about<br>
double that though!<br>

I wish I could get a club started at my school, but there aren&#x27;t 
enough people who would actually want to. And my school probably 
wouldn&#x27;t let me.

Well if you want to buy some instructional thing, then you should 
buy a video at www.ellusionist.com. I&#x27;ve bought two videos, and a 
product from there, and they&#x27;re GREAT!

today at school we were working on our multimedia project so I asked if I could use the camera to make a video of me while speedcubing. I only got 1 attempt because the batteries of the DV-camera were running low. Anyway, you can watch the result at:<br>
<br>
http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/lars.mpg<br>
<br>
I did a decent 22.30 seconds. F2L was quite clumsy, my hands stopped a couple of times, but OLL and PLL were both easy cases. I can definately  do better and hope to do some more videos.<br>

BTW, how did you hear about the Revenge being available in Australia

          <div class="email-content">While on an expedition to buy a birthday present for someone (a <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube, of course) I found a puzzle I had never seen before. <br>
Obviously, I had to buy it immediately. At first I thought it was <br>
just a variation of the Rubik&#x27;s Sphere (ie. spherical version of the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube), but upon opening the box I discovered that the <br>
mechanics, and therefore necessary algorithms, were different.<br>
<br>
I checked the Twisty Puzzles site so I could tell you what it <br>
actually was. Mechanically, it&#x27;s like the Chromesix Colour Ball (aka: <br>
Cromoball, Chromosix): http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/fs.cgi?<br>
str=puzzle.cgi?pid=561. The only difference with mine is visual - it <br>
has numbers on each circular &#x27;face&#x27;. So, as well as matching the <br>
colours, the numbers need to be in the right order and the right way <br>
up.<br>
<br>
When I started solving it I was aiming to do the colours, the <br>
position of the numbers and the orientation of the numbers, all at <br>
the same time. I was making reasonable progress but then I decided to <br>
ignore the numbers and just fix the colours. Once I stopped worrying <br>
about the numbers I fixed all the colours pretty quickly. I was quite <br>
proud of myself because it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve figured out <br>
a new puzzle by myself. :) After accomplishing the colours I started <br>
positioning and orienting the numbers on the colours. I&#x27;ve done 5 of <br>
the 6 faces. I&#x27;m almost there! I was so excited to get this far so <br>
quickly that I had to write a post. :)<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have this puzzle?<br>

<br>
I recently picked up some Studio cubes, and have been working on <br>
making them into speed cubes.  <br>
<br>
I tried using silicone spray as a lubricant, and found that it causes <br>
the plastic in the cube to erode (I can gouge it with a fingernail).<br>
<br>
So the studio cubes seem to be made out of a different type of <br>
plastic than used in my oddzon cubes, which tolerate the same spray <br>
very well.<br>
<br>
Has this happened to anyone else who uses studio cubes?<br>

It only takes about 10 minutes for me to prepare them and after that they are ready to go.  All i do is use silicone spray, work it into the cube until it feels good.

Hi Justin,
What &quot;magic silicone spray&quot; is this one you are using that takes you just 10 minutes to prepare your cube?

          <div class="email-content">Just my 2c: I always used to lube the cube by removing an edge and 
two corners and spraying a silicon oil in, putting the edge and the 
corner back and then twisting to spread the oil evenly between the 
cubies. However, in doing so, the cube became VERY _sticky_ and was 
worse than before lubing. To avoid this, in my experience, it is very 
important when you lube your cube to take it completely apart, spread 
the cubies on a flat surface and then spray the cubies with the 
spray. Now, this is very important: Do not assemble the pieces 
immediately but wait a while. The volatile ingredient of the oil will 
evaporate and then the surfaces will become almost dry, but greasy - 
this is what you want. (It is probably this volatile ingredient that 
causes the stickiness and it stays inside the cube for quite a long 
time before it also evaporates) When you assemble the cube, it will 
twist PERFECT even though it was stiff before. If you do not loosen 
the screws, the cube may in one day or so become to hard to twist 
again, so you will need to lube again and/or loosen the screws.

Happy cubing!

<br>
I want to put my two pence in too :]<br>
<br>
I wonder if it&#x27;s the volatile ingredient that makes the silicone <br>
&#x27;sprayable&#x27; (not a real word apparently!).  I have also used the lube <br>
from rubiks.com which is silicone these days (used to be wax).  The new <br>
formula also makes for a sticky cube!  It&#x27;s runny and comes in an easy <br>
to apply syringe.  I think this might also have a volatile ingredient <br>
to make it runny.<br>
<br>
IMHO, the silicone I use is way better.  It&#x27;s not runny and not <br>
sprayable, but it is easy to put in a syringe for clean application.  I <br>
bought this pot of silicone from a plumbing shop.  It&#x27;s VERY thick <br>
indeed!  Turn the pot upside-down for a day and it will not shift!  I&#x27;m <br>
guessing this stuff has no volatile ingredients.<br>
<br>
&quot;For lubricating pipe and fittings, spigots and ring seals on plastic <br>
push-fit waste, soil and underground drainage systems&quot;<br>
<br>
If you use a syringe the cube can be used straight away with no mess!  <br>
If you use a little too much, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it just collects in <br>
any cavity inside the cube.  If you use WAY too much, it will ooze out <br>
for a while  :]<br>
<br>
Even though it&#x27;s very thick, it is super slippery and will make for a <br>
very fast cube.<br>
<br>
I hope I helped!<br>

It doesn&#x27;t have sound. Anyway, my cube&#x27;s almost silent and I like it

You gotta be concerned about the petroleum in Vaseline.  It&#x27;s supposed to<br>
erode plastics, right?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, my two cents...<br>
<br>
I used to use vaseline.  I thought then that it was wonderful.<br>
There are two main problems I had with it, though (which I don&#x27;t<br>
have with a silicon spray):<br>
1) It didn&#x27;t last.  It was only good for a week or two.  After<br>
that, it really sludged up, and it was worse than unlubed until<br>
I completely cleaned it out and relubed.  A good silicon lube<br>
can last me a couple months (I don&#x27;t cube as much as others, I&#x27;m<br>
sure).<br>
2) It was a mess! Whenever I popped a piece (and this happened<br>
frequently, with my very loose cube), I had a plastic/vaseline<br>
mixture mess to clean up. I had to wipe down the cube and wash<br>
my hands before I could get back to cubing. With the silicon, I<br>
just pop the piece back in and get back to cubing.<br>
<br>
If you still want to try the vaseline (&#x27;cuz you can&#x27;t find any<br>
silicon), just put some vaseline on the end of a Q-Tip and apply<br>
it to each screw (where the center pieces connect to the middle<br>
of the puzzle).  Then also apply some to the back of one or more<br>
of the center pieces (enough to spread around inside the cube),<br>
reassemble the cube, and use it for a while to spread the<br>
vaseline around.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have had only mediocre results with the silicone spray.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I use Vaseline and it works great at lasts a long time !<br>

          <div class="email-content">Beware of vaseline!!!  It&#x27;ll turn the inside to mush!!!<br>
<br>
I picked up a cube at an antique store.  I&#x27;m guessing the thing was <br>
sitting there at least 5 to 10 years.  It turns very nice, but the <br>
inside was filled with vaseline.  I advise that you use vaseline for <br>
awhile, clean it out, and use silicone.  The vaseline will erode <br>
making a smoother surface, then when you apply the silicone, it gets <br>
better.  But don&#x27;t mix the silicon and vaseline together, thats bad!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I use Black Magic Professional Protectant.  It&#x27;s a car dashboard 
polish/cleaner.  It has a picture of a car dashboard on the bottom of 
the bottle.  Anyway this stuff is amazing.  I take a new cube, take 
it completely apart and lube each piece.  Then I let the pieces sit 
for 10 minutes or so and then I put the cube back together.  
Afterward the cube turns very well, except that a new cube still 
won&#x27;t cut corners.  I had the problem of getting stuck every now and 
then on Monday because I was triggering this new cube like a cube 
that cuts corners (which fails miserably by the way heh heh).  Anyway 
the Black Magic stuff is great, it&#x27;s the only stuff I use (it&#x27;s a 
silicone base).

The only way I know how to wear a cube down to where it cuts corners 
is to use it for a long time, never tried sanding but I hear it works 
if you do it right.  My strategy is just to never throw your cube 
away.  I have the same cube from 4 years ago when I first started.  
When it starts to pop pieces a LOT, around 2 years old or so, just 
stick with it and your hands will adjust to the looser cube and you 
won&#x27;t pop pieces anymore.  I have to go through adjustment periods 
every now and then, like if I use someone else&#x27;s cube for a while, to 
get readjusted to my superloose cube or else I pop pieces pretty much 
every trial.  It also works the other way, if I start using other 
people&#x27;s cubes I try to cut corners too much and end up locking up 
the cube a lot.  The only problem is you ONLY cube your best on YOUR 
cube.  I don&#x27;t know if it works better but I say don&#x27;t throw the cube 
away until it&#x27;s absolutely 100% dead and it will be a great speed 
cube.  Then again I&#x27;m still not to sub-20 so maybe this plays a role?

Just my two cents,
Chris

I hasn&#x27;t harmed any of my cubes and I only have to clean it out and 
re-lube it about every 3 months. Pop out and edge an two corners and 
put a small amount inside and work it !

Yes it exists, mine arrived about two weeks ago. It&#x27;s pretty good but 
doesn&#x27;t really tell you more than his website already does.

Check it out: http://www.tregay.net/Grant/Cube/videos.shtml

I&#x27;ve got 3 videos each for the cubes that I have (2x2 - 4x4) and
two videos with my megaminx.  My cube times aren&#x27;t necessarily
all that impressive (2x2x2 in 15-20s, 3x3x3 ~30s, 4x4x4 ~2:30), but 
I&#x27;m pretty proud of my megaminx times (~2:40).  Let me know what you 
think!  I&#x27;m open to constructive criticism - I&#x27;d love to be &lt;25 for 
the 3x3, but my last average was 31.04.

Cool! And I also understand it, because I am from Sweden. The most 
words anyway, haha. It&#x27;s fun that speedcubing appears more often in 
the media. Cmhardw&#x27;s clip will be out soon, won&#x27;t it?

          <div class="email-content">First, let me say that if you have a cube without springs (e.g. <br>
Meffert&#x27;s assembly cube), this isn&#x27;t the way to do it!  Here&#x27;s what I <br>
wrote back in August (Post #1289):<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s how I normally do it (no tools necessary, provided your<br>
hands are strong enough/cube is loose enough):<br>
1) rotate R so FR is directly next to UF<br>
2) Put your right thumb on the F side of FR, pointing toward UF<br>
  (with the tip of your nail touching UF)<br>
3) Put your left index finger on UFR and left thumb on DFR<br>
4) Push your hands together (UF to the left with your right hand,<br>
  UFR and DFR right with your left hand), wedge your thumb in<br>
  between the two edges (UF and FR), and then use the leverage<br>
  to pull FR out.<br>
5) After the one piece is out, the rest should come with no trouble.<br>
<br>
I avoid using a screw driver or anything else hard, because I feel <br>
like I&#x27;m scratching up the inside of my cube.<br>

It usually takes some time to break a cube in.  Usually I get a new 
cube when i can tell that my current speed cube is going to need 
replacing soon (like a week or 2 in advance)....and I just let one of 
my friends mess with it for a few days, then I lube it with &quot;prestone 
silicone lubricant&quot;.....and it will still need more breaking in, so i 
either let the friend have it for a little longer or i use it to cube 
sometimes.  I have sanded the insides of a cube before, it worked 
ok.  I didnt think it was any better than just breaking it in.  I 
sanded the flat inside areas of the edge and corner pieces.  Not on 
the mechanism that holds it all together.  

I just got a rubiks studio cube a couple weeks ago.  It was REALLY 
stiff at first, even after i sprayed it with silicone.  It just 
needed breaking in.  Now it might just be the best cube i have ever 
had. 

..........hope this helps...

          <div class="email-content">Have you tried stretching your cube.  This works only if your cube 
has springs in the skeleton, if it doesn&#x27;t, it will snap the center s 
off.  
THis what you do, take plastic gift cards, credit cards, phone cards, 
etc.  and wedge them inbetween the peices,  This stretches the center 
upward and after a couple minutes it reduces the tension in the 
springs.  Be careful though, this can make your cube pop if you do it 
too much!!!

Also your corner problem, your gonna have to take your cube apart to 
fix it.
Hope this helps

&gt; Anyway I have a real old cube that I thought was pretty useless,<br>
&gt; but I lubed it up with baby oil, and it turns very nice now. Has<br>
&gt; anybody else tried this?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; JD<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Hey guys, did we already establish that there was something in baby oil that<br>
can be detrimental to the plastics?  I can&#x27;t remember!<br>
<br>
JD, was it Johnsons Baby Oil?  You have to check for petroleum based<br>
ingredients mostly.<br>
<br>
Did anyone try graphites yet?<br>

You know what? I&#x27;m happy. Today, I did my first 18&quot;, with a not too<br>
lucky cube.<br>
<br>
Do you know where to find new springs for a 22 year old cube? The<br>
original ones are too weak now. I can&#x27;t find 2.5mm springs in stores.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m currently in the process of making an *advanced* f2l quiz for <br>
practice.  The idea, will be several hundred advanced cases of f2l, <br>
all listed without pictures.  It will be listed in the following <br>
format:<br>
<br>
1:  F&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 F L&#x27;  (8, FR)  <br>
<br>
Where, the first sequence of turns will set up the pattern to be <br>
solved, and in parenthesis is the number of moves it should be able <br>
to be solved in (as a guideline only, less or more doesn&#x27;t really <br>
matter, but the goal is efficiency), and after that is which corner <br>
is to be solved. (in this case, the front right)<br>
<br>
You COULD reverse the set up sequence to solve, but I would advise <br>
that you don&#x27;t look at it, and try to figure out alternatives.  For <br>
example, I would solve the above situation with a different alg:<br>
<br>
(U)R U2 R2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D R<br>
<br>
Hopefully this quiz will help me and others out with tricky <br>
situations and seeing better on the f2l.  I&#x27;m currently doing shows <br>
of the play Cyrano de Bergerac, in which I am a lead for perfomance <br>
this weekend.  After the show nights are over, I will begin creating <br>
it.  I mention to everyone, because I want to ultimately have as many <br>
cases as possible.  The goal will be to get all the way through <br>
without missing one!  If anyone would like to discuss, email at <br>
cybeross@..., or come to chat this weekend in the mornings!  Let <br>
me know what you think, especially those cubers nearing/under sub 20!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m in San Francisco, and you can find this stuff in any Kragens or
Pep Boys. I&#x27;ve found it in every automotive store I&#x27;ve looked for it
in. OK, that&#x27;s just 5 or so stores over the years, but the stuff is
not hard to find if you know where to find it. Usually on or near
the shelf with the wax and various shinyfiers.

Don&#x27;t know about hardware stores or Internet though.

prestone stuff!! i was so relieved that my search was finally over... 
it was only two bucks also... thanks to sall for tellin me about that 
stuff... it works great! i put some in today and i already started 
learning some triggers and im getting good a certain moves... but 
doing the whole cube with triggers is slow for me cause im not use to 
it yet... but ill get there... and sam give me an email and we can 
talk... i dont even average 1:30 so maybe you could tell me a little 
about your method... anyway thanks to everyone... all i need to do 
now is get under a minute! and replace my stickers with something... 
they are getting crusty... sall said to use colored electrical tape 
which sounded like a good idea... but its ffin $2 a roll... thats 
twelve bucks for all the colors... i guess its worth it because i 
will have that tape for a really long time... but im going to look 
for alternitave methods in the mean time... anyways enough blabbing.. 
im out...

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!<br>
I guess some of you guys and gals also got the mefferts Xmas special.<br>
Has I´ve been planing on ordering a 5x5x5 cube this seems like a good <br>
deal.<br>
But they seem small.... (it says &quot;6cm x 6cm x 6cm&quot; or 2,36 inch for <br>
you yanks)<br>
My Rubik´s 4x4x4 is 6,5cm (2,55 inch).<br>
Has anyone used a Mefferts 5x5x5 cube that is only 6cm? The cubies <br>
must be realy small. Won´t they break?<br>
Is it worth it?<br>

Mine is (was) 7cm.
It died after 3 hours.
The plastic stickers were too thick.

I have all three of the cubes in that special, I can tell you everything I<br>
know about them.  They turn very smoothly and easily, but there is not much<br>
give.  This means that you have to meticulously make sure everything is<br>
straight before turning another side.  If all is not straight, then it<br>
totally locks up.  I&#x27;m not much of a speed cuber on the big cubes, but they<br>
still add maybe 15% to my times because they are not forgiving enough.<br>
<br>
They are built from hollow parts, if you know what I mean.  When you turn<br>
some sides 45 degrees, you can see into some of the cubies.  They are white<br>
opposite yellow and there is a purple instead of orange.<br>
<br>
I have not tried to lube them, so perhaps I would get more luck from them<br>
that way.  I think they are very well built, and I&#x27;ve never worried that<br>
I&#x27;ll break them.  I think that some of you guys demand more from your cubes<br>
though!  I&#x27;ve never broken the centres of a normal 4x4x4 yet!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s interesting that mefferts say they can be disassembled, I&#x27;ve never<br>
tried this!<br>
<br>
My advice is, if you want a neat looking cube for your collection, this is<br>
very neat!  But if you want to speed cube, it&#x27;s probably not the one.  If<br>
you get it and lube it, then post your results so I know whether to bother.<br>

          <div class="email-content">This mini cube has been selling on ebay, it is not made by Meffert.
It will NOT fall apart like mefferts does, but, it is very small, and
not for speedcubing.
If you want a cube to play with it, get it. Same for the 4x4. The 2x2 is
actually
Bigger than a normal 2x2x2, it is nice. The stickers arent that great
on these, 
But the puzzle is better, and it is worth it.

Dont disassemble the 4x4x4 its a completely different mechanism and
you need 3 hands to put it back together.
Have fun with the 5x5 :-)

I have all three of the cubes in that special, I can tell you everything
I
know about them.  They turn very smoothly and easily, but there is not
much
give.  This means that you have to meticulously make sure everything is
straight before turning another side.  If all is not straight, then it
totally locks up.  I&#x27;m not much of a speed cuber on the big cubes, but
they
still add maybe 15% to my times because they are not forgiving enough.

They are built from hollow parts, if you know what I mean.  When you
turn
some sides 45 degrees, you can see into some of the cubies.  They are
white
opposite yellow and there is a purple instead of orange.

I have not tried to lube them, so perhaps I would get more luck from

          <div class="email-content">The Xmas Special looks good, especially since I don&#x27;t yet have a

Well, I don&#x27;t have a high or a low opinion of them.  I think they should get<br>
their act together with their quality control.<br>
<br>
As for the Christmas Special, I think you should go for it, it&#x27;s a lovely<br>
collection.  They&#x27;re quite odd to look at because the stickers are so...<br>
perfect!  I think they&#x27;re made really well and Mefferts have a lot to learn<br>
from the guys who make these.<br>

Not so pointless. It&#x27;s still possible to compete on it. My time has 
been beaten now so there is competition.

Besides, it&#x27;s a good contrast to doing a 20x20x20. : )

If the cube is already solved, what is it then you are expected to 
do? How do the timing process work and what does it time? Seems very 
meaningless to me.

          <div class="email-content">I think it is a fantastic record, Richard.  Congratulations!  It seems you 
can now complete your cubing marathon by starting with 5x5x5, moving to the 
4x4x4, 3x3x3, 2x2x2 *and then*  finish with the much more pleasing, 
logically satisfying finale of a 1x1x1.  But why stop there? Continuing to a 
0x0x0 should not be discounted, and in the same spirit we are then propelled 
into the intriguing world of &quot;negative cubing&quot;: cubes such as -1x-1x-1, 
-2x-2x-2 ...

But back to the 1x1x1: the record seems to be 0.032 seconds, but this is 
using a computer interface.  I wonder if I could do better with the real 
thing, a timer, and some really good lube.  Does anyone know where you can 
buy a 1x1x1?? Any suggestions appreciated.

I am thinking of using a &quot;corner-first&quot; method.

I made my own 1x1x1 using only the parts from a standard 3x3x3.  Trust me,<br>
it can be done with only one donor cube!  I&#x27;ll sell you mine if the price is<br>
right.  Or if you want me to do a construction instruction sheet, then give<br>
me a while to make one and get it proof read.<br>

According to my calculations, a 0x0x0 or lower is not possible because the<br>
corners intrude on the territory of the centres.  If someone has any ideas<br>
on a different shape or something, then that would be helpful.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had the same problem with a 4X4 from Hessport last month, although in my case, the white logo center piece was broken before I even opened the package.  I think that they may be getting broken or cracked during assembly.  At any rate, I spoke with Patrick Hess and had a new one in the mail the day after my package arrived.  (they would not cover my shippnig however.)  Also, if you guys look around on Rubiks.com, there is a note on one of the pages stating that the 4x4 is &quot;not for speedcubing&quot; and that it will break easy, almost sounds like a disclaimer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">My new Rubik&#x27;s studio cube works great! Now I really understand why <br>
all the cubes on those videos sound so smooth. After lubricating it, <br>
I made a new record almost a whole second lower than my earlier. My <br>
avg is now at 22.33(before 23.1), and I think I might be able to <br>
improve even more because of the uneven times. Keep practising, <br>
it&#x27;ll give result! David Wesley<br>

No, I&#x27;ve had 0.015 recorded and Ron has had 0.010 seconds. I&#x27;ve also 
had 0 seconds on 1 turn but it doesn&#x27;t record the time. : (

summer.  Did they change there design or plastic that these 4x4s are

that they suck even more.

I have a studio cube i got 2-3 weeks ago.  I used that prestone stuff 
on it.  And it works great now (excapt for the occasional pop.) it is 
smoother and runs better than the oddozon cubes i have had.

Who is this Patrik Hess guy? Do you have an e-mail adress to him?

had a new one in the mail the day after my package arrived.  (they 
would not cover my shippnig however.)  Also, if you guys look around 
on Rubiks.com, there is a note on one of the pages stating that the 
4x4 is &quot;not for speedcubing&quot; and that it will break easy, almost 
sounds like a disclaimer.

I had the very same problem with my studio cube.  The red and orange 
are almost the same color.  Heres what I did....

I had an old 80&#x27;s cube (ideal toys brand) laying around that i had 
used for speedcubing awhile back but it got REALLY loose and no good 
for cubing anymore :(....the stickers are still in great shape on it, 
so I stole the stickers off of the 80s cube and put them on the 
Studio cube.  I really like the orange color of the 80s cube because 
it is really bright.  

So i dont have a problem with getting confused between red and 
orange :)

hope this helps

  Funny... My cube broke with exactly the same piece! The center piece 
  with the Rubik´s logo.
  Who is this Patrik Hess guy? Do you have an e-mail adress to him?
  Worth a try, right?

  had a new one in the mail the day after my package arrived.  (they

  sounds like a disclaimer.

          <div class="email-content">Some people here have had good luck with nail polish.  Good luck<br>
finding good colors, though.<br>
<br>
My wife and I went to the store, and Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild makes a good<br>
red, green, white, and yellow (color numbers 414, 416A, 449B and<br>
423B respectively), although I haven&#x27;t actually painted my cube<br>
yet - they look good in the bottles, though.  The green is<br>
actually a metallic green.  For the blue, I turned to L&#x27;oreal<br>
Paris, Jet-set quick dry nail enamel, color #235 (orbit).  My<br>
orange is &quot;Super Top Speed&quot; Revlon, color #260 (Swoop).  Just<br>
make sure you do a few coats, let it dry completely (can take<br>
quite a while), and put on a top coat or two with &quot;hard as<br>
nails&quot; to reduce denting.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it looks a lot better than stickers (I did paint<br>
some on an old cube) and seems much more durable, but it takes<br>
a lot of time to do.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

I have used electric tape when I rebuilt a ordinary cube to a bandaged cube. If I dident I would not be able to tell what subcubes are glued together. It works ok but the corners of the tape dont stick onto the cube that good when I&#x27;m using it. Mabye this would work better if I had rounded the corners when I was cutting the tape. Also, it was impossible to find orange tape so I had to use black. Black tape is a bad idea because usually each sticker is a color surrounded by black. Takes some time to get used to.

So if you can get all six colors in nail polish I would suggest you use that. Unless nail polish is far more expencive, I have no idea about prices for it.

/Kï¿½re

ps.  Still havent solved that bandaged cube.

          <div class="email-content">The best solution I&#x27;ve found and the less expensive too:

Plastic separators (I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right word -
&quot;intercalaire&quot; in french). $1 for 6 sheets of different colors, enough
for many many cubes. Use Neoprene glue.
It lasts for years, never gets damaged, you can wash it (or cube under
water), etc.

Take a look at the cube in my hands on the video:

Hope this helps,

Yes.  You can get replacement stickers from rubiks.com.  Strangely, the <br>
replacement stickers are much much better than the stickers they use on <br>
their cubes!  (Bizarre or what?)  I have not actually ordered stickers <br>
myself because someone from this group was kind enough to send me a set, <br>
gratis (Thanks Robert!).  The result is *excellent*: each colour comes in a <br>
set of nine that you can put onto a face in one go.  The original stickers <br>
lasted about 6 weeks, but I put a replacement set on about 5 months ago and <br>
they are pretty much the same now as they were when I first applied them.   <br>
The colours are really good, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
So, try the stickers from rubiks.com.  For $4.99 you get three sets, which <br>
should last for years.<br>

&gt; So, try the stickers from rubiks.com.  For $4.99 you get three sets, which<br>
&gt; should last for years.<br>

&gt; Good luck with your cubing: keep us posted on your progress!<br>

<br>
I&#x27;ve not been following this thread, I&#x27;m afraid.  If someone is stuck for<br>
replacement stickers, I still have a set that I can send.  If you want them,<br>
send me your address and I&#x27;ll post them.  I don&#x27;t mind posting these<br>
anywhere in the world for free if someone will use them.<br>
<br>
Just to let you know though, the only ones I have left are holographic!<br>
They are all the correct colours, except where white will be silvery.  There<br>
are six sheets, one for each face.  They are pre arranged with the correct<br>
spacing so you literally just slap them on all in one go!  I&#x27;m not sure how<br>
good holographic is for speed cubing, especially if the light is not right.<br>
<br>
I think I also have a set for the Revenge.  I&#x27;m not at home to check, but if<br>
I do have a set then they are plain (not holographic) and if someone wants<br>
them, let me know.  I used a set of these on my own Revenge and they do fray<br>
a little but so far they have stayed put and not lost any laminate.  The red<br>
is a bit similar to the orange too.<br>

It was okay when opened it, but after a quick spray of silicon it was

bought earlier this year!!

  Hi Casen: welcome to the group, BTW.<br>
<br>
  Yes.  You can get replacement stickers from rubiks.com.  Strangely, the <br>
  replacement stickers are much much better than the stickers they use on <br>
  their cubes!  (Bizarre or what?)  I have not actually ordered stickers <br>
  myself because someone from this group was kind enough to send me a set, <br>
  gratis (Thanks Robert!).  The result is *excellent*: each colour comes in a <br>
  set of nine that you can put onto a face in one go.  The original stickers <br>
  lasted about 6 weeks, but I put a replacement set on about 5 months ago and <br>
  they are pretty much the same now as they were when I first applied them.   <br>
  The colours are really good, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
  So, try the stickers from rubiks.com.  For $4.99 you get three sets, which <br>
  should last for years.<br>
<br>

Tricky one this.  Did you get the plastic ones or the laminate ones?<br>
<br>
My first cube was an oddzon fitted with paper laminate and they looked crap<br>
after one week.  I put rubiks.com stickers on and they&#x27;ve been on for 18<br>
months.  I recently bought a new oddzon cube, which still come with paper<br>
laminate but they&#x27;re better than the old paper laminate.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the sticker kit you got from rubiks.com is simply their latest paper<br>
laminate version rather than the decent plastic ones?  In a way, I can see<br>
why they would prefer to supply replacements that also wear out, so they can<br>
make repeat sales...   Well wouldn&#x27;t you?<br>
<br>
I think my spangly holo-stickers are not paper laminate though, as they are<br>
also spangly on the reverse.  Still no takers?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Mine are plastic, I believe, but they do have a laminate over the top to keep the color from wearing away.  This peels and rolls towards the center, making for an unsightly cube after only two-three weeks.<br>

  &gt; I ordered a few sets of replacement stickers from Rubiks.com two months ago,<br>
  &gt; and didn&#x27;t find the quality to be very impressive.  Maybe I am just harder on<br>
  &gt; my stickers, but I think the replacement stickers are just as bad as the<br>
  &gt; original .com stickers.<br>
  &gt; <br>
  &gt; aWAKEn<br>
<br>
  Tricky one this.  Did you get the plastic ones or the laminate ones?<br>
<br>
  My first cube was an oddzon fitted with paper laminate and they looked crap<br>
  after one week.  I put rubiks.com stickers on and they&#x27;ve been on for 18<br>
  months.  I recently bought a new oddzon cube, which still come with paper<br>
  laminate but they&#x27;re better than the old paper laminate.<br>
<br>
  Perhaps the sticker kit you got from rubiks.com is simply their latest paper<br>
  laminate version rather than the decent plastic ones?  In a way, I can see<br>
  why they would prefer to supply replacements that also wear out, so they can<br>
  make repeat sales...   Well wouldn&#x27;t you?<br>
<br>
  I think my spangly holo-stickers are not paper laminate though, as they are<br>
  also spangly on the reverse.  Still no takers?<br>

A wise consideration.  Perhaps they would not only need to be rounded, <br>

I&#x27;ve always thought it would be a good idea if the labels were counter <br>

          <div class="email-content">You could always use a Dremel rotary tool, with a router attachment, to cut a recess that the label would fit into.  However, I am not sure how much the integrity of the cube would be jeopardized by thinning the plastic sides.  Also, It would take a lot or precision.  I&#x27;ll give it a try this week, with a cheap cube that I broke last week.  Maybe you could set the stickers in the slots, then put a nice clear top-coat on them to keep them nice forever.<br>

For the LL I orient/permute corners in one alogorithm and then 
orient/permute edges in one algorithm. The system for recognizing the 
corners is explained on Ron&#x27;s site and also Akimoto has it on his. 
For me this works faster because you will only have to look at edges 
for the last step. Also this method requires I think 6 less 
algorithms than the standard LL way.

          <div class="email-content">The Rubik&#x27;s brand one I bought earlier in the year I got from 
Toys &#x27;r&#x27; Us. The smooth one that I just bought was from a new puzzle 
shop in Canberra called Socrates. I&#x27;ll try and remember to check the 
packaging so I can let you know more detail.

It&#x27;s soooo smooth compared to all my other cubes. It&#x27;s so 
EXCITING! :) It&#x27;s the first cube I&#x27;ve ever had that would be 
suitable for finger tricks (now I have no excuse not to learn them). 
I&#x27;ve been cubing much more in the last week since getting the new 
cube. It&#x27;s so exciting to have a smooth cube that I just can&#x27;t put 
it down!! :)

          <div class="email-content">Based on this group, I&#x27;d say that far more serious cubers are male.

I just love puzzles. Any type where there are lots of little pieces 
have have to fit together in a complicated way, eg. Rubik&#x27;s puzzles, 
scrabble, crosswords, jigsaw puzzles. Fun!

I&#x27;ve even found a job where I get to use (vaguely related) logic 
problem solving (I work on expert systems).  :)

Uh, did you get different stickers than me? I ordered 2 sets of three <br>

          <div class="email-content">cool stuff indeed,if a good cube can be found in Australia than that <br>
sounds real good to me.most of mine come from the USA via ebay and i <br>
hate dealing that way,total pain some times.<br>

my new cube is still a bit stiff but i think it will be good,except <br>
when i have to adjust the spring inside,getting te centre caps off <br>
look to be a task in itself.trying to get them out without damaging <br>
the caps etc may be tricky...plus glueing the stickers back on <br>
with &quot;WHAT&quot; kind glue is another problem.<br>
<br>
i stumbled across the Rubiks Revenge in my local puzzle shop today,i <br>

<br>
Dan Knights here.  I kind of ducked out of the online speed cubing <br>
world for the last year or so - I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of travelling, <br>
climbing, and working.  But I&#x27;m glad to see that this club is so <br>
active!<br>
<br>
For some time I&#x27;ve been working on incorporating my left hand into my <br>
solution.  My goal is to significantly reduce the amount that I have <br>
to turn the whole cube in my hands while solving, by performing <br>
mirror-images of moves &quot;Lefty&quot;.  And I know my left hand is capable <br>
because I play guitar and my left hand does things that my right hand <br>
can only balk at. <br>
<br>
But this has proven to take a lot longer than I thought!  It&#x27;s been <br>
hard to focus when my times went from 17&#x27;s to 27&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s only <br>
recently that I&#x27;ve been able to average under 20 again.  (WITH the <br>
use of my left hand.)  Anyway, I expect this to effect an overall <br>
reduction in time after further practice.<br>
<br>
So I wish you all peace and good cubing, and congrats to all the <br>
newbie cubists who are hacking their times down toward the teens!<br>

Hi Dan!  Welcome back to the fold!<br>
<br>
I bought a cube from your Ebay auction in January or so.  Back then I <br>
averaged something like 90 seconds.  I still use your cube and I <br>
average 35 when I&#x27;m in the right frame of mind  :]<br>

<br>
If your replacement stickers were white on their adhesive side, then <br>
you got the crappy paper laminates.  If they were the same colour both <br>
sides, then you have plastic ones.<br>
<br>
My ones are plastic right through and I expect them to last for years.  <br>
They can even be submerged in water and it&#x27;s no problem at all.  If I <br>
get messy with my lube and the stickers get gooed up, then a quick wipe <br>
and they are as good as new again.  The only thing that has gone wrong <br>
so far is a lifted corner that would not stick down again.  I just cut <br>
it off and it hardly shows.<br>
<br>
If you got the paper laminates, then that&#x27;s just rotten luck.  I wonder <br>
if you explicitly requested plastic ones, would they supply them to <br>
you?  It&#x27;s no good them supplying paper laminates that are as bad as <br>
the original stickers.<br>

Hi Dan,

Thanks for helping me out about 3 yrs ago-- I&#x27;ve got my times down to 
around 23 sec, where I&#x27;ve been stuck for some time.  Nice to see 
you&#x27;re still cubing.  I hope you find the time to post every now and 
then; many of us can use advice from one of the top cubists!  Just to 
let you know, a bunch of us are usually in the chat room on Sat and 
Sun, pretty much any time of day; so if you have time and feel like 
it, drop by.  

Dave

I wouldn&#x27;t try and second guess a sub 20 cuber, but if I could solve 
it in 17 sec I wouldn&#x27;t be tampering with my method at all ! I&#x27;m 
happy just to dip below 30 !

Apparently a local puzzle store is about to get in some Revenge cubes

(which includes a 4x4x4) I will probably just wait for Mefferts.

Good to hear that the Revenges are making their way to your side of 
the country too! :)

I am using the Maestro cube too. Its the same as Mefferts assambley cube. At least the patent nr. on the box is the same as the nr at mefferts homepage to they should be the same. With the help of some silicon they are good but after a few months they get too loose for my taste. There are no springs to tighten so I just bought a new one. They sell for 39sek, around us$4.

          <div class="email-content">Yep. I had totally the same experience with the silicon. I&#x27;ve found 
that silicon always improves a cube, but the difference it made with 
the Maestro cube was AMAZING!!

The cube is great at the moment but I&#x27;d been concerned that it would 
become too loose. I was hoping to find screws when I took off the 
centre white cap, but alas, no. I&#x27;m going to go back to the same 
puzzle store on the weekend and get a spare or two if they still have 
any. It&#x27;s so difficult to find a good cube in Canberra!

          <div class="email-content">I was interstate visiting friends this weekend and, of course, took <br>
my cube along. As you can guess from my last few posts, I&#x27;m pretty <br>
excited about my new cube. I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with the cube all <br>
weekend. I wasn&#x27;t off in a corner cubing by myself or anything silly <br>
like that. I just played with my cube while chatting with my friends. <br>
They all know I&#x27;m into cubing so they didn&#x27;t pay much attention which <br>
was good because I wasn&#x27;t in the mood for speed demonstrations, I <br>
just wanted to enjoy the spin of my new cube.<br>
<br>
I had brought along a 2nd cube in case any of them wanted to have a <br>
play too. I ended up showing the basics to one of my friends. I <br>
started with the cross, then the rest of the F2L, then on to the LL. <br>
Then a crazy thing happened. We were almost done, only 3 LL edges to <br>
fix. I was about to show her Lars P&#x27;s &#x27;Allen&#x27; algorithm when I <br>
suddenly had a blank. I use this algorithm almost every solution, <br>
without thinking or even looking at the cube. But when I had to do it <br>
slowly and step-by-step, I couldn&#x27;t! I just sat there staring at the <br>
cube not being able to remember past the first two turns.<br>
<br>
During the same afternoon I happened to be learning two new algs and <br>
had I been asked to teach those algs it would have been fine -- I <br>
could remember those step-by-step, but not the alg that I&#x27;d been <br>
using for years.<br>
<br>
I guess the part of the brain that stores the information when we <br>
first learn an alg is quite different to the part that stores it when <br>
it moves into our subconscious. It&#x27;s like I initially know an alg as <br>
a series of individual steps, but after a while I know it as a block <br>
movement.<br>
<br>
Bizarre...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve never heard of Loctite 401 -- I assume it is available from 
hardware stores? What about clear nail polish, would that work too? I 
remember some discussion recently about using coloured nail polish in 
replace of colour stickers. I guess this means that nail polish 
doesn&#x27;t damage cubes?

I can&#x27;t wait to get my new cubes. I know they&#x27;ve got a long way to 
travel so I&#x27;m just going to have to wait. :( How long did it take to 
get your cubes from Mefferts to WA?

This is normally what I do in these situations and it&#x27;s normally fine 
after that. But even this didn&#x27;t work. I had to put the cube away and 
then come back to it half an hour later!!

          <div class="email-content">My guess is that the moves are more intuitive or subconscious or 
whatever they call it.  The thing is you first had it recorded by 
memorizing the alg, but eventually as you get faster and faster, you 
drop the algorithm because you don&#x27;t need to remember the notation to 
execute the move at your current speed.  This makes it difficult to 
recall algs.  I think thats how it works(?)

Your &#x27;smoothest cube ever&#x27; cube are definately smooth.  I had one as 
well.  The problem I had with it is that you can&#x27;t &#x27;cut the corners&#x27; 
or allwoing you to perform certain finger tricks.  Also the center 
kernal in mine was fragile and the center of one side broke off.  I 
don&#x27;t know if it was cheapy plastic or just a fragile cube.  
Becareful!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ton, GameOfDeath2,

   I&#x27;m new here. PMFJI.

   Twenty years ago I got my average time down to about 27 seconds. I
am just getting back into it, at the moment I&#x27;m down to about a minute
to a minute and a half.

   Among the &quot;not recommended&quot; cubes on Ton&#x27;s site (nice site by the
way) is the Rubik&#x27;s Deluxe which came out about 20 years ago. I must
disagree with this. This cube was fast enough for the 27 second
average, and what&#x27;s more it&#x27;s very durable as I still use it. I
recently lubed it for the first time with graphite and it is faster,
though I&#x27;m not back up to speed yet. 

   I sent off for a Hessport cube with their silicone-based lube and
it&#x27;s pretty nice. If you can&#x27;t buy these in England maybe you can do
it through the internet.

   Does anyone have information about the new &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; put out
by Winning Moves company? Is this cube better than their regular cube?
Is their regular cube good?

   Thanks in advance

   David J

I tried to watch the video from this site and Jon&#x27;s site and it said

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been stuck at the same crappy average of 22.0 for 2 1/2 <br>
years....  and I FINALLY BEAT IT!!!! <br>
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was <br>
starting to get sick of 22.0 seconds heh heh but I finally got a <br>
better one, and under the weirdest circumstances too!<br>
<br>
here were the times,<br>
<br>
21.79 20.76 (26.24) 20.65 (18.39) 22.89 22.02 22.28 (pop) 19.09 24.40 <br>
20.93 19.74 = 21.455 = 21.46<br>
<br>
Wow, I forgot what this high feels like!!!!  Bwahahah!!!  ok <br>
sorry. :) :) :) :) :) :)<br>
<br>
So anyway I broke it under some strange circumstances.  When I was up <br>
in New York they had to change the stickers on my cube because it was <br>
so beat up looking.  They had me filming with a brand new cube that <br>
I&#x27;d lubed up while they changed the stickers.  Anyway, when I got <br>
back home and was messing with my cube it was turning really weird.  <br>
It kept sticking a LOT, so I figured &quot;wow ok time for a lube&quot; and I <br>
took it apart, cleaned the inside, then lubed it and was ready for it <br>
to be working like new.  Well it still stuck on me like CRAZY.  So I <br>
took the cube apart again and was looking at some of the pieces and <br>
whereas all my pieces should be worn down like crazy from being 4 1/2 <br>
years old some were CLEARLY brand new.  So anyway I think they <br>
switched some pieces with the new cube to save time from having to <br>
switch all the clean stickers over.  Well I was doing an average <br>
tonight, after realizing I don&#x27;t have all of my orginal cube, and <br>
just decided to cube harder (turn the faces hard enough to just get <br>
through the sticks).  Well this average was the result of that!  I&#x27;m <br>
sooo happy!!!  Yet so confused...  Ok I have a question.  All you sub <br>
20&#x27;ers and other very fast people, how often do you change cubes, how <br>
loose is your cube, and all that?  I figured if I can&#x27;t break my <br>
average on my cube, but I can break my average using some of my cube <br>
and some pieces from a new cube, then maybe it is better to not have <br>
a super loose cube but one that puts up some resistance?  Anyway this <br>
really gives me some motivation to start practicing again.  I&#x27;m <br>
trying to take it really light so as not to screw my wrist over for <br>
another six months but I can&#x27;t wait to take another average!!!<br>
<br>
So anyway I think I&#x27;m THE slowest person, or definitely one of the <br>
slowest, to speed cube and try to make it to sub-twenty but I&#x27;m one <br>
stepping stone closer.  I&#x27;m going to start practicing again, but I <br>
would appreciate some feedback on people&#x27;s cubes.  I&#x27;m starting to <br>
think that maybe the super-loose never throw your cube away strategy <br>
is a bad idea.<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  BWAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!  and it only took 2 1/2 years to <br>
get past 22.0 seconds!!!!<br>

me: I am stuck trying to get my average sub-30, and have been for about <br>
three months now.  I will just have to stick at it, like you have!<br>
<br>
I hope you zoom through the next barrier and join the sub-20 crowd real <br>
soon!  Maybe your practice over the last couple of years is going to pay off <br>
all at once.   Best of luck, and look after your wrists,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for your encouragement, Nicolas.<br>
<br>
Just to let you all know ...<br>
<br>
I had been working on the F2L up until two weeks ago, and now have a large <br>
number of shortcuts under my fingers.  As is to be expected I suppose, since <br>
learning these my F2L time have got a bit slower, because the recognition <br>
part of the process is different and more complex.  Also, I find that these <br>
new shortcuts make looking ahead more difficult, because they move the <br>
cubies around in slightly different ways. But with a bit more practise <br>
learning these shortcuts should pay off.<br>
<br>
But since two weeks ago I have finally taken the plunge and set to learning <br>
all the llo algs.   I know some of you out there seem to learn these in a <br>
matter of days, but it takes me about 3 days just to learn one!  I think <br>
maybe some people are &quot;naturals&quot; and others are not; if so it seems I am in <br>
the &quot;not&quot; camp!  But I also know that practise can make up for that, and <br>
anyway any such differences iron out over time - as long as you are willing <br>
to put that time in, of course.<br>
<br>
Since I started speedcubing about half a year ago I have never fussed *too* <br>
much over my times, instead trying to concentrate on cutting down the number <br>
of moves it takes to solve the thing, and ensuring that my technique is <br>
relaxed and smooth with the algs that I execute.  Hopefully if I keep my <br>
focus on these two aspects of speedcubing faster times will eventually <br>
follow.  For me, if I start concentrating purely on speed I start to <br>
seriously tense up: the muscles in my hands start to lock up, and this gets <br>
transmitted down into the cube itself. I wonder, does anyone else find that?<br>
<br>
Anyway, for me one of the attractions to solving the cube very quickly is <br>
that when it works it is in some way a creative act, a sort of dance or <br>
something (particularly the cross and F2L).  Solving it really fast (which <br>
for me is under 30 seconds, only done this a few times!) is just <br>
exhilarating: when everything flows together it just feels fantastic.  <br>
Somehow, a number of various things, some abstract and some not, all blend <br>
together into this single burst and BANG! ... chaos is replaced by beautiful <br>
order.   Hmmm ... or am I just full of pompous, pseudo-intellectual pap?<br>
<br>
Whatever: happy cubing everyone!<br>
<br>
S.<br>
<br>
PS  If I can reliably make sub-30 averages I am hoping my reward will be a <br>
return ticket to Toronto in guess-when 2003!<br>
PPS I can&#x27;t make the chat room for the next few weeks: I have moved house <br>
and at the moment do not have access on weekends :-( but will be get back <br>
there soon!<br>

Somebody who can solve the Rubik&#x27;s Magic Master Edition, I presume - 
I think that&#x27;s the only (Rubik) puzzle with Master in the title.

I&#x27;ve never even seen a square 1 (outside of pictures on the web), so 
I fail on variety and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d qualify as a cube master by 
any sensible criterion because I am far too slow on the main event 
(3x3x3) (time), I don&#x27;t know anywhere near enough algorithms (time 
too and just general sophistication/knowledge of puzzle). As for 
years of experience, I started early but there was a period of 
probably 12-14 years where I didn&#x27;t do the cube (or very, very 
rarely) so I don&#x27;t really pass there either.

People who are really good at puzzles probably know some group 
theory - at least as far as conjugations and commutators and their 
effects in regard to permutations. Also many of the best known 
algorithms, from what I understand (although I haven&#x27;t actually seen 
the details), use Jordan-Holder decompositions of groups to solve 
puzzles.

          <div class="email-content">That sounds great!  You will come back and beat me no doubt now!  I <br>
have a few questions however.  I recall that you stopped rotating <br>
during f2l for a while, and your times suffered horridly.  Surely you <br>
resumed rotating again to get this average?  Or did you actually <br>
figure it out.  If you HAVE indeed stopped rotating together as I <br>
have, I have some ideas as to why you didn&#x27;t get faster perhaps.  <br>
Since I stopped rotating altogether for the f2l, I have devoted EVERY <br>
SINGLE cubing moment to the search for optimized cases and advanced <br>
tricks for the f2l.  I have learned at least 100 since only a month <br>
ago.  Did you likewise devote your time?  It seems to me that if you <br>
didn&#x27;t actively search to better your cases, there would be no way to <br>
improve.  Which reminds me.  A few of us in the cube chat, are <br>
creating an f2l cases file.  We are coming up with solutions for each <br>
of the 41 &quot;standard&quot; f2l cases from every angle without rotations.  <br>
We have turned up a great deal so far, and we&#x27;d love to have you drop <br>
in, it may very well be worth your time!  I&#x27;d really like to discuss <br>
how you went about your improvement after so long, as I feel that I <br>
myself am very nearing a jump. <br>
<br>
Yesterday, I took with me my big analog clock and practiced for hours <br>
on end. This was all not rotating of course.  All my times were <br>
comfortably in the low 20&#x27;s.  A few 17 and 18&#x27;s, but mostly 21-23.  I <br>
was listening to music as well, and studying cases.  It was then, <br>
that I decided to try going full speed, rotating as free as I <br>
pleased.  To my surprise, I had 5 times:  17, 18, 17, 19, 18.  I <br>
couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I stopped right there.  I promised myself to <br>
learn all the cases that I&#x27;m working on, and get down to these times <br>
without rotating before I get back into my old habit.  (BTW, it was <br>
with cube rotations that I achieved my average of 20.17 seconds).  I <br>
know that as soon as I complete (this may never happen! :) ) my quest <br>
for f2l knowledge, I will drop below 20.  It&#x27;s a good feeling, but I <br>
still have a long way to go.  Well, enough of this rant, just curious <br>
to see how you&#x27;re doing.  <br>
<br>
Congratulations!  Good to see you cubing again!  Please come to <br>
weekend chat!<br>

I find that some algs just flow through the fingers more smoothly 
than others, and so there are some algs I really enjoy and other algs 
that I only do because I have to.

Also, sometimes I have a smooth run where the whole solution flows 
together well (very satisfying) and other times it gets broken up 
(poppage, dropping the cube, or simply taking a second or two to find 
the right cubie).

I ordered the Xmas special the 26th. It was sent from Hong Kong the 29th and arrived here in Sweden today (4th).

The 2*2*2 was easy, now its time to see what I can do to the bigger ones.

          <div class="email-content">I am currently swapping from the normal jiri method to corners first 
and wish to hear the experiences of other people on a particular 
facet of the solution method I am learning, so please reply!
What I am interested in is the first stage of my solution: I fully 
complete one face. From years of jiri practise I can do four edges 
fast and then do the four corners fairly quickly (just like a normal 
f2l except not bothered which pieces appear in the middle layer) so 
doing this way is &lt;15 quite easily. What I am attempting though is to 
do the four corners first, and then insert the centre and four edges. 
Despite Marc Waterman suggesting this can be done in 6-7 secs on 
average I am normally doing low to mid teens for this stage (and when 
it goes a little badly can be a lot longer).
Has anybody else tried this both ways? Does corners then edges give 
faster times for the layer than the other way round? How fast can you 
lot out there do the single face on a normal go and at best? Any tips 
that might help? I seem to remember Jessica used to do one face first 
(is that right?) so it would be interesting to know how she did it as 
she was a fast cuber at thtat stage.

          <div class="email-content">My cubes were a little loose so I discarded the corners and put in <br>
fresh corners that I mixed and matched from a few spares (something <br>
katsu recommended once) and I found that the cube felt well worn in <br>
(due to using a well worked spider) and was a couple of seconds <br>
quicker on average. I think that the gain is mainly that the little <br>
pauses that appear when you concentrate upon keeping the faces <br>
aligned with a loose cube start to disappear when there isn&#x27;t so much <br>
risk of cube lockup.<br>
I now have a cube from Ton and it is really nice - it has screws <br>
which means that it can be adjusted until the faces turn properly, <br>
and then lubed. This means the cube can be broken in very quickly. <br>
Just one tip for everybody out there: don&#x27;t use a serrated knife to <br>
get the caps off or you will make a complete mess - I am so glad I <br>
bought two ;) This cube is definitely the best I have ever used so I <br>
am hoping to go sub20 within the next 6 months.<br>
In short; loose cubes are limiting (or maybe not since really it is <br>
all personal preference) and the cubes that Ton (and others) supply <br>
are the bees knees. Get one now!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles: congratulations on your great new average, BTW, I am looking <br>
foward to one day (soon??) posting something similar...<br>
<br>
<br>
You say how for each algorithm you want / need to understand what each <br>
algorithm does, down (I think) to every move.  I find this interesting <br>
because it is the complete opposite of how I cube, and the antithesis of my <br>
final goal.   For me the execution of the orientation and permutation <br>
algorithms are almost completely a tactile action during which the <br>
algorithms are experienced as single events.  If I try to split an algorithm <br>
down to separete moves my mind does not really come up with the goods (try <br>
saying the alphabet backwards: the knowledge is there, but not easily <br>
retrieved).<br>
<br>
It is bit like reading: when you start learning to read you might need to <br>
divide words into their syllables, or even the letter-components, but over <br>
time you read words as single entities (except very long words, perhaps, if <br>
they are new to you).  The same goes for the cube: the algorithms that you <br>
learn becomes your &quot;cube-language&quot;, comprised of single moves (letters) that <br>
may or may not sit together as triggers (syllables); these make algorithms <br>
(words) which work together to form complete solutions (sentences / <br>
narratives).<br>
<br>
As I become more fluent in this language, combining words into meaningful <br>
sentences (i.e. flowing algorithms together to solve the cube), so solving <br>
the cube becomes more natural, and takes less time.<br>
<br>
So for me, the whole goal is to move away from a deconstructed knowledge of <br>
any algorithm, and instead aim for the opposite: to &quot;flatten out&quot; my <br>
awareness until solving the cube is experienced as a single action (and <br>
hopefully, one day, one that takes less than 20 seconds to complete!).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I recently designed from scratch all the algorithms needed for the LL<br>
&gt;permutation step. I don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel. I&#x27;m an engineer<br>
&gt;and I just need to understand what I&#x27;m doing and be able to remember<br>
&gt;these algorithms after a 10 year pause.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Of course, I&#x27;m far from optimal sequences, some of them can take 17<br>
&gt;moves (R2==1 move, M==2 moves).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I&#x27;d like to know if you, speedcubers, understand every move of every<br>
&gt;algorithm, what it does and how it works, or if you just read it and<br>
&gt;practice until you know it by heart?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;In http://www.speedcubing.com/algorithms.html, code P21:<br>
&gt;L&#x27;U&#x27;LF2R&#x27;DRUR2D&#x27;R2U&#x27;F2, can you explain how this sequence was<br>
&gt;conceived ? (ok ok, Cube Explorer ;-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Gilles.<br>

&gt;Yesterday, I broke my best average time with 25.23 (using only 6 algs)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ross and other friendz,<br>
<br>
&gt;I was just reading about Jess Bonde and<br>
&gt;his Guinness attempt at 2,000 cubes. I was<br>
&gt;extremely disappointed to find out that if<br>
&gt;he broke the record during just *one* of<br>
&gt;those times, he would set the new official<br>
&gt;world record.<br>
You are absolutely right.<br>
Of course Guinness will not accept a world record for a single cube if someone<br>
would take 2,000 attempts.<br>
Another thing is that time measurement for 2,000 cubes in 24 hours, is something<br>
else than for a single cube with hundredths of a second.<br>
<br>
I think a fair opportunity would be 5 single cubes. He should do that before the<br>
marathon starts. He should use a decent timing device, not just a pc with a<br>
program. I am not sure if he is thinking about doing this at all. I think I<br>
would do it if I had the opportunity.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

Ive broke a few as well, never the logo one. They dont offer

They have a disclaimer now because they know they are junk.
O, by the way, Rubiks 5x5 is the same as mefferts. Its not bigger like

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve noticed something about the way I&#x27;ve been cubing recently (after <br>
my cube got its pieces mixed up with a new cube).  I just took <br>
another average and got 22.50 which is something I would have <br>
considered a really good average on my looser cube.  I noticed <br>
something though, I get a lot more sub twenty times per average, and <br>
my sub twenty times are faster.  With my loose cube I&#x27;d get the <br>
occasional 19 but now I&#x27;m getting 18&#x27;s regularly and the occasional <br>
17.  Anyway I also think I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the way I do the <br>
F2L.  All my really fast times (17 and 18 for me) are done when I do <br>
something a little different during the F2L.  Normally while I&#x27;m <br>
putting in a corner edge pair I&#x27;m either paying attention to that <br>
corner edge pair and I pause afterward looking for the next pair, or <br>
I&#x27;m looking for another PAIR while putting in the current one which, <br>
if I locate a pair, saves time.  On my recent really fast times I&#x27;ve <br>
noticed that I just sort of take a mental note of the other first <br>
layer corners and middle edges that I see as I&#x27;m putting in a corner <br>
edge pair.  For a period of 2 or 3 moves I may be tracking 2 or 3 <br>
pieces on the edge of my concentration but as soon as I locate the <br>
pair to one of those pieces my mind tracks that pair and I take off <br>
with it after I finish the pair I&#x27;m on.  These times have all <br>
resulted in 17&#x27;s or 18&#x27;s which is really really good for me.  Anyway <br>
I don&#x27;t know if this helps anyone who&#x27;s working on F2L, but I&#x27;m <br>
trying to do this more consistently.<br>
<br>
Also Ross, yeah I was paying attention to whether or not I twisted <br>
the cube while I was taking that average.  I don&#x27;t twist it very <br>
much, not like I used to.  I noticed that I put pieces into the back <br>
pairs a lot so I guess I got used to doing most of the <br>
moves &quot;backwards&quot;.  I do twist sometimes but it&#x27;s usually if the move <br>
is just at a really awkward angle or if I&#x27;m turing a face and <br>
twisting the cube at the same time.<br>
<br>
Anyway just my two cents on a possible improvement to doing the F2L.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I need to improve both my f2l and ll skills but i find my LL skills <br>

it better.  Maybe I need one of those *clicks* again<br>

          <div class="email-content">I (although very biased) think that doing corners then edges is much 
faster that edges then corners.  

For my entire cubeing history, I have done corners first.  When I 
started doing the cube, I would solve one layer.  I did a corner, 
then an edge, then corner, or whatever felt good. 

Then on my own choosing I stopped doing it like that and started 
doing the corners, and then edges.  I did that because I knew I 
needed to do one first and another second so that I could speed up my 
recognition.  And it was hard for me to visualize four edges without 
corners, because I would not know where to put them (because I did 
not know my color configuration.) So with much practice I have done 
one layer first in that way corners, then edges.  

Then after much practice I learned of Marc Waterman, and his method, 
which was very similar to mine.  The major difference was that he did 
the corners without the center.  That was a hard step for me.  I 
still do not do it that way when I am solving for speed.  

Now I haven&#x27;t read his method in a long time.  But I believe he does 
not do the entire layer first, but he does corners, then edge, then 
edge with center, then one last edge.  My method is very similar to 
that, in which I do corners around the center, then three edges.  The 
missing edge is used as a Keyhole when doing the bottom layer edges.  

So anyway after reading your message I went to time myself on how 
fast I did one layer.  I solved the layer how I normally do, then 
looked at the timer, and then finished the layer and looked again at 
the timer.  

Here is what I got:


1. 7 		8
2. 9 		10
3. (13)		(15)
4. 6 		9
5. 8 		10
6. (6) 		(7)
7. 9 		10
8. 8 		9
9. 8 		8
10. 6 		8
11. 7 		8
12. 7 		11

7.5+.5=8   9.1+.5=9.6

So on average it takes me 8 seconds to get a layer done minus one 
edge, and 9.6 seconds to complete a layer.  While I was timing myself 
I realized that the time really depended on how fast I could get the 
corners done.  And sometimes the corners would really depend on how 
the state of the cube was when it was scrambled.  So I think that the 
best way to improve first layer times is to practice getting the 
corners done quickly.  

I remember that Marc Waterman would solve two adjacent corners, and 
then the other two simultaneously.  And that I think is the best way 
to do it.  If my memory is good I remember that he would do all four 
corners on average in 6.5 moves.  I think that for me, my next step 
on improving this part of my solution would be to learn all 
possibilities of solving the second two corners.  

I hope that through all of my babbling I might have helped you a 
little.  

Good luck,

-Kenneth

You are correct. During the completion of the F2L, I do not turn the 
cube once.  I am noticing interesting things, and suspect I may soon 
be left with a sort of hybrid cross left/cross bottom system, 
combining the best of both worlds for quick triggered solutions from 
all possible angles.  It has already yielded good new moves, so 
things are going well.  Sub 20 in 6 months Olly!  We&#x27;re gonna do 
it!  ;)

          <div class="email-content">He will probably break the world record, but will the timer be 
recording each individual cube? So we won&#x27;t know. And also, if he 
does get a lucky case, then it would probably be after the first 
hundred or so cubes, so he&#x27;ll probably be doing about 25 or more 
seconds per cube by then, as his wrists will be tired. So I wouldn&#x27;t 
worry too much.

So Kenneth, when you do the second face corners do you permute and 
oreint in one algorithm ? I participate in the Sunday contest often 
and you usually beat me by a few seconds. I&#x27;m trying to use the 
Waterman method but haven&#x27;t learned the sequences for solving edges 
two at a time yet. How do you finish your last edges ?

          <div class="email-content">I am currently learning a corners first method and would say that 
corners, then edges is faster.  I worked out all 18 algs where ULB 
and ULF are solved, and the remaining U corners are in DRB and DRF 
positions.  Placing the last 2 corners takes an average of 4.77 
moves, ranging from 4 to 6 moves, plus 1 &quot;alg&quot; 1 move long (R2).

I try to solve the edges of the first side as advised by Waterman 
(1st edge, 2nd edge with center, then last 2), but find that doing 
the second edge plus center somewhat tricky.  I imagine that as I get 
better at this, I will be able to recognisethose situations where I 
can save moves while placing the last 2 edges.

Anyhow, I Didn&#x27;t like hunting for the correct corners to start the 
one side, so I now use Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s method to get all 8 corners 
oriented and positioned.  I can still solve the edges a la Waterman 
without disturbing the remaining corners, and they are already done 
when I finish the first side.  This saves me the need to memorize the 
18 (17 plus R2) algs, plus the 42 algs necessary to orient and 
permute the remaining corners.  I think this may cost me a few moves, 
but it saves me a lot of grief.

By the way, which slice moves work best for you?  I switched from M 
slice moves to E slice moves, as I was finding it difficult to 
execute M slice moves very smoothly.

My revenge broke as well :(....its been broken for quite some time 
now.  You know if someone who has  a broken revenge was really nice 
they would be willing to send pieces of their broken revenge to the 
other with broken pieces....that way people wouldnt have to pay 
another 25 or so dollars for a whole new cube when theres only one 
piece thats broken.

....just doin some thinking out loud.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t discover this discussion sooner.<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about this issue also.<br>
It would not be fair if I had 2000 tries to break the world record.<br>
But let me tell you that Guinness actually recognized this.<br>
I don&#x27;t know what their rules are, on one hand: I think the world <br>
record should be the time when someone does this in good conditions <br>
at top speed. On the other hand, the terms should be equal for <br>
everyone, and I think the people at Guinness would get tired of us if <br>
we all applied for a record attempt.<br>
<br>
Here is what I plan to do:<br>
I will start my session for 2000+ cubes at 12.00 on Dec. 16th. using <br>
my own javascript timer. Everytime I reach 100 cubes, I will print <br>
the results, keeping track of averages etc.<br>
When I get a pop, I will not stop the timer, but assemble the cube <br>
and solve it, and keep the time.<br>
When I get a lucky time, I will stop the timer as close to my session <br>
average as possible and accept the time, as I believe that this will <br>
also count as a solved cube.<br>
<br>
As for best time (I believe this is the main issue)<br>
At 11.30 I will do 12 cubes trying to break the world record of 22.95 <br>
sec. These solves will be timed by another person with a stopwatch.<br>
I have not consulted this with Guinness, but I think they will aprove.<br>
This is the way a final has been announced for the WC, so I think <br>
this is fair.<br>
When I have done these 12 cubes, I will announce the times in my cube <br>
log at: http://www.rubiks.dk , you can concider the best of these to <br>
be the new world record if you want to (should it be below 22.95), I <br>
will not assume anything before I get the recognition from Guinness.<br>
<br>
I hope people can relate to this, otherwise feel free to speak up.<br>

Wow, you&#x27;ve got your cubes already *and* you ordered after me. I&#x27;m 
still eagerly awaiting the arrival of my cubes.

&gt; So Kenneth, when you do the second face corners do you permute and <br>
&gt; oreint in one algorithm ? I participate in the Sunday contest often <br>
&gt; and you usually beat me by a few seconds. I&#x27;m trying to use the <br>
&gt; Waterman method but haven&#x27;t learned the sequences for solving edges <br>
&gt; two at a time yet. How do you finish your last edges ?<br>
<br>
Yes I do permute and orient in one algorithm (from <br>
www.speedcubing.com).  I too have not learned the sequences for <br>
solving the edges two at a time, mainly because I know as soon as I <br>
do my times will suffer dramatically.  For my last edges I am slowly <br>
learning the algs on speedcubing for simultaneously putting in the <br>
last edge, and flipping edges in the middle layer.  I found that <br>
compared to the algorithms for the corners, they are easy to learn, <br>
and much easier to mix up and forget.   <br>

Do you know how many moves on average it takes you to complete the 
corners, using Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s method?

I have found that M slices are great for me.  I only have one move 
that uses E slices. It is E2 M E2 M.  It took me forever to get that 
move down, because E moves were foreign to me.  But after much 
practice, I like just doing that move over and over again for the 
heck of it. 

But my favorite move, using finger triggers, is U&#x27; M&#x27; U.  I Do the U&#x27; 
with my left index, at the same time perform a R together with a M&#x27;. 
Then I perform an R&#x27; and then a U with my right index.  So the move 
could be [U&#x27; (M&#x27;R)] (R&#x27; U) When done nicely it feels like you are 
doing two moves, U&#x27; U.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, since there&#x27;s been so much discussion on this lately, I&#x27;ll say<br>
my bit.<br>
<br>
I originally got a 4x4x4 from Mefferts.  First thought - if you&#x27;re<br>
concerned about cost, Mefferts&#x27; 4x4x4 wins - only $18 with shipping.<br>
Rubiks.com will charge you at least $26.88 with shipping (if you&#x27;re<br>
in the US or Canada), or a nice $38.88 with shipping for you<br>
international folks.<br>
<br>
However, while I was writing this up, I went to look at Mefferts.com<br>
and they don&#x27;t seem to have the 4x4x4 in their store anymore.  You<br>
can get it as part of the &quot;Xmas special&quot;, but that one is smaller<br>
(6cm sides) than the original (6.5cm sides), so it couldn&#x27;t be used<br>
for replacement pieces.  Can anyone who has the &quot;Xmas special&quot; from<br>
mefferts confirm this size difference (Compare it with another 4x4x4<br>
cube)? Anyways, the special is $36, so this also makes Rubiks.com<br>
the cheaper option for anyone in the US or Canada (although you get<br>
a nice 5x5x5 with the Mefferts.com deal).<br>
<br>
Second thought - While my original 4x4x4 broke shortly after getting<br>
it from Mefferts, the replacement that they sent me hasn&#x27;t had any<br>
problems, and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.  How have<br>
other people had theirs break (aside from Neal, who dropped his)?<br>
Regardless, it&#x27;s not really surprising that they break so easily.<br>
The center pieces are held on by a very small amount of plastic, and<br>
there aren&#x27;t any springs in the puzzles (as there typically are in a<br>
3x3x3), so shock (like dropping it) and extra strain will have a<br>
more direct affect on this small connecting section.  I&#x27;ve changed<br>
my method, so that slice moves (u, d, l, r, f, and b, not E, S, or<br>
M) are virtually eliminated.  If you need those slice moves, you<br>
might want to do things like (Rr) R&#x27; instead of r, to avoid the<br>
excess strain that they put on the centers.  If you do centers last<br>
(which you probably shouldn&#x27;t do anyways ;-), this could add<br>
considerably to your times.<br>
<br>
Finally, I bought a new puzzle (spent the $18), but I plan to keep<br>
the old one around to use as replacement pieces in case the new one<br>
does break on me.  I would love to share, but there are enough<br>
people that have broken their 4x4x4 cubes that I would not have any<br>
replacement pieces left for me (call me stingy, I guess).  Someone<br>
could go into the business of selling &quot;replacement pieces&quot; - buy a<br>
4x4x4 cube from rubiks.com for the $27 and sell the 24 center pieces<br>
for $1.25 or so (decide your own profit), plus shipping cost.<br>

Lots of practice and a well broken in cube.  The cube in the video is

My friend had a 4x4x4 for about a year, until he let me borrow it 
and I broke it. LOL But then he got a new one, and it still works 
really well. The ones from Rubiks.com(that&#x27;s where he got it) are 
really good, so I would advise you get one from there.

&gt; Do you know how many moves on average it takes you to complete the <br>
&gt; corners, using Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s method?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I just calculated the average as follows:<br>
<br>
1.  Get all U and D facelets on the U or D face-  3.94 moves (16 Algs)<br>
<br>
2.  Move all U facelets to U face and D to D face 3.67 moves (3 Algs)<br>
<br>
3.  Permute position corners correctly- 7.4 moves  (5 Algs)<br>
<br>
for an average of 15.01 moves.  It may take 0-2 moves to get one of <br>
the 16 initial position, and 0-1 moves to align the U and D face in <br>
step 2.<br>
<br>
The Worst case scenario would be 2+6+1+5+11=25 moves.  The best case <br>
scenario would be 0+3+0+3+3=9 moves, with all steps performed.<br>
<br>
I am not sure about the frequency of each situation, so this is just <br>
a straight average. <br>

You should look on the Speedcubing.com links page, they have alot of 
good stuff. Also, the books &#x27;Conquer the Cube&#x27; and &#x27;The Simple 
Solution to the Rubiks Cube&#x27; would probably help, but the Simple 
Solution book is a verry slow solution. My site might help also: 
http://www.geocities.com/rubiks81
I explain three different ways to solve the cube.

          <div class="email-content">I met with somebody who worked with guiness book of records and <br>
destroyed the world record for him. He was trying to encourage me to <br>
get a couple of independent witnesses, video footage and some photo <br>
stills of my cubing at some point in the future so that I could set <br>
the record officially. And yes, I could have as many attempts as I <br>
wanted.<br>
I thought the reason none of us have done this yet is that 22.95 is a <br>
fairly lame and easy to beat marker, and it would probably upset more <br>
people than it impressed.<br>
I guess it would be more legitimate after a large championship to <br>
attempt to beat the record in that manner, but it would still be like <br>
getting a 147 at snooker in practise (fairly routine) rather than in <br>
competition (which would be almost never).<br>
I have no gripes with anybody who does break the record in this <br>
manner, but at some point the record is going to be about 6 seconds <br>
by somebody who averages middle teens, and then the beating of the <br>
record will only occur on freak cubes.<br>
Since we have moved on from the days of it being an extreme sport <br>
where the best of three attempts counted, perhaps guiness should be <br>
encouraged to only consider averages as records. I would propose that <br>
we do 13 cubes, discard the best time and the worst two times, and if <br>
you pop a cubie you put it back in and continue until solved (which <br>
means likely to be your worst time). This would also stop &#x27;cheating <br>
pops&#x27; when you think your average might be compromised.<br>
Anyway, good luck Jess.<br>

I always solve both cross and F2L on the bottom. I used to solve the cross on<br>
top, but I had problems finding the first corner/edge pair after the cross. That<br>
is when I started solving on the bottom, but it took me a long time to get used<br>

Now I can solve the cross on the bottom, on the left and on top.<br>

If I were you I would try the left or the bottom for a while.<br>

i was sitting in a restaraunt and while i was waiting for the food to

earlier this year and i am trying to learn how to turn the cube with 
my other hand.  i moved  R-U&#x27;-R  with a &quot;trigger&quot; and the noise was 
so loud it sounded like a gun being cocked.  the guy at the next

So anyway, be warned....

Thats the thing I hate about Geocities. There is a verry limited 
amount of space, so it shuts down alot. Getting my own domain name 
would be too expensive too.

Well I&#x27;m not a sub 20 cuber(mostly sub 30)but to me solving the cross 
on the bottom is difficult for me. I solve in on top and then turn 
the cube over.

I always solve white cross.  I didn&#x27;t learn how to do this a particular <br>
way, so natural evolution took place.  That&#x27;s the best way really.  My <br>
hands decided that the left palm was better.  Finally, the cross is on <br>
the bottom.  I don&#x27;t pretend to do this quickly, average under 5 <br>
seconds I suppose.  If I time myself I&#x27;ll get a few 1-2 seconds and <br>
some 8-9 seconds.  I feel so dumb when that happens!<br>

I would hesitate to call myself ambidextrous, maybe neither handed <br>
would be more accurate ;) I play racket sports above the shoulder <br>
with my right arm, and below the shoulder with my left, my writing is <br>
unreadable with either hand, my left foot was equal to my right until <br>
I broke my leg whence the left became dominant, I throw with my <br>
right, snooker lefthanded, cricket right handed. When I played the <br>
piano 15 years ago both hands were okay, but trying recently I find <br>
my left hand has no idea. So no real pattern; no rhyme nor reason.<br>
As regards cubing, when I started 3 years back both hands were <br>
equally poor, but with a lot of practise my right hand is now much <br>
better than the left. For some reason my left hand has just not <br>
improved.<br>

          <div class="email-content">When I first read your question I realised that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure 
what I did. I knew I used both hands to cube, but wasn&#x27;t sure whether 
one was dominant. I had to run through a solution and check. Here&#x27;s 
what I found:

1. The cross -- both hands, but right slightly hand dominant
2. Rest of F2L -- both hands, but right hand dominant
3. LL -- both hands, but LEFT hand slightly dominant

I was surprised to discover that my left hand did more of the work 
for the most complicated part of the solution.

I write with my right hand, but I can type and use a mouse equally 
well with both hands. I also play piano and flute, which would have 
helped develop digital dexterity in both hands.

          <div class="email-content">Here are my thoughts on this subject...

When solving, I pretty much understand what happens in F2L. I never 
memorised F2L algs from a website, I just kept playing with the cube 
until I understood how to solve F2L. For LL, I&#x27;ve learnt other 
people&#x27;s algs but I don&#x27;t really understand how they work. I find 
that when I understand how an alg works, I no longer think of it as 
an alg. If I think about LL, I could identify and count all the 
discrete algs I use. However, for F2L, I have no idea. I just do what 
needs to be done.

          <div class="email-content">I am actually left handed, but for some reason do quite a few mundane 
actions with my right hand (scissors, bottle-opening, ironing, ok not much 
ironing ... ).  When cubing it seems to be:
cross, pretty much left hand only
f2l: both hands, but anything with my left hand is faster
ll: left hand dominates majorly

Maybe I need to start getting my right hand more involved?

I am working with a client on a speed promotion. Our idea is to 
demonstrate amazing speed in several uncommon ways.  One of those is 
speed cubing. We are looking for one to three persons who would be 
interested in attending and demonstrating their abilities in this 
area. The show is in early 2003.
It might even be good pre-championship promotion for the world 
championships in August.

Can you provide me information that will help us make this work.  
Thanks for you response and help.  We would be particularly 
interested in the 4x4 cube area as well as 3x3.
&lt;unquote>

Have fun,

You&#x27;ll need to know some group theory - at least as far as the 
Jordan-Holder theorem.

Did you look for it? With Google and &quot;Thistlethwaite cube&quot; there&#x27;s a 
brief outline for the 5th link. Of course, since you misted the 
2nd &quot;th&quot; out of the name it would have made your task more difficult.

Anyway, here&#x27;s a link:

Can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s like a knot. I don&#x27;t know too much about knots 
but from what I recall a knot is basically a continuous injection 
from S^1 into R^3 or, if you prefer a continuous map from [0,1] to 
R^3, injective on [0,1) and having the same image at 0 and 1.

Telling if a knot is the unknot is also a difficult problem in 
general. Telling if the cube is solved is generally easy. You might 
try and see if you can find out about groups associated with knots 
and find a knot associated to the cube group but this is likely to 
be very hard and, in anyway, isn&#x27;t a good idea for a project.

Try a project unrelated to the cube - otherwise people might think 
you&#x27;re obsessed with it!

There are quite interesting things concerning the golden ratio that 
you could look into. It has connections with art and also with 
nature (through the Fibonacci sequence). If you ever saw &quot;The Human 
Face&quot; (BBC - John Cleese and Elizabeth Hurley probably been on US TV 
too, as it is out there on video and/or DVD) then the number John 
keeps going on about is the golden ratio (of course, after a short 
time he crudely cuts it off to 3 decimal places or so).

If you go with knot theory an interesting idea, but possibly not one 
your teacher is after so maybe you should check first, is to look at 
generalizations, mapping S^2 continuously into R^4 for example (or 
more generally S^n into S^{n+2}). That&#x27;s quite general and it may be 
quite difficult to come up with results but you might be able to 
generalize some of the concepts of knot theory.

For instance, in R^4 every knot is equivalent to the unknot (taking 
a knot to be an embedding of S^1 into R^4 here). Perhaps it is true 
that every embedding of S^n into R^{n+3} has a similar property?

Fractals are pretty cool. The most famous examples are the 
Mandelbrot set, the snowflake curve and the Julia sets. We had an 
exercise about the Mandelbrot set in first term undergraduate (or 
maybe it was second term - whatever, in our first topology class). 
Probably it was to show that it was compact (seems pretty easy off 
the top of my head, but maybe I am skipping details, boundedness is 
obvious and closure seems easy too, but I may be wrong about that) 
and I think connected, but connected may have been mentioned as a 
property rather than an exercise. That is less clear to me, so I&#x27;m 
not going to claim that we definitely did that.
It may even be path connected, at least locally.

I wonder if you might be able to combine the snowflake curve with 
the Fibonacci sequence in some way (in terms of dividing the sides 
not into thirds but into 3 pieces connected with this sequence) and 
hence to the golden ratio. What kind of fractal might you get? 

Anyway, there are a few ideas. I&#x27;m afraid my brain isn&#x27;t used to 
much, mathematically speaking (or otherwise!), any more so they may 
not be good suggestions but I think they could be OK.

My tip is to leave the cube out of it and save that for a group 
theory class. You can do a whole bunch of stuff on it there.

   I mentioned that I used graphite to lubricate the cube, there is
however a small problem associated with this. The graphite doesn&#x27;t
stay within the cube, and gets all over my fingertips. This is
lessening over time, though.

   If anyone&#x27;s interested I&#x27;m starting to get below a minute on a
regular basis.

   You asked, > I&#x27;d like to know if you, speedcubers, understand every
move of every algorithm, what it does and how it works, or if you just
read it and practice until you know it by heart? &lt;

   I am not familiar with all of the terminology in use. What people
here are calling algorithms I call sequences. I use the term algorithm
for the overall approach. For example, &quot;corners first, then edges&quot; is
an algorithm.

   All that I do on the cube I have figured out myself, and I
understand most of it. I&#x27;ve just picked it up again and I&#x27;m not only
remembering what I used to do, but so far I&#x27;m learning something new
every day. I don&#x27;t have a full set of sequences yet, but I&#x27;m working
on it.

   The only book I read on the cube was Minh Thai&#x27;s. I read it, not to
learn what he did, since I saw him in person, but to see how he
thought about it. Interesting read. I recommend the game he played
with it.

   I&#x27;ve read a few sequences online, and they are very cool, but I
must say that I consider all the levels to be equal, so I count a
center slice the same as an outer level (or &quot;side&quot;). I also count any
movement of a level as one move, so R, R2, and R&#x27; are each one move.

   I recommend understanding what algorithms (sequences) do, as it
will give you more opportunities.

          <div class="email-content">Hi All,

   About this &quot;World Record&quot; attempt:

   For those who have been working on getting fast enough to set a new
mark at the World Championship, I say ignore this &quot;World Record&quot; &quot;event.&quot;

   A &quot;World&quot; record, for those who are new to language, is where
people from all over the *world* compete for it. One person competing
against no one else isn&#x27;t even a competition, never mind a local
regional, state, country, continent, or world competition.

   If there were something like 1000 cube mixes, even 1000 &quot;standard&quot;
cube mixes, and people from all over got to try them simultaneously,
that would be different. Do it live on TV and the internet, lots of
places linked up, with 50 of the same mixes at a time given to a group
at each place who actually mixed the cubes up, and have at it.

   Sorry for the rant, but some things that are ridiculous need to be
pointed out.

   Comments are welcome.

   Thank you,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">My new puzzles have arrived!!! So excited!!! :) It was like Xmas -- 
all these new toys! I got the Mefferts Xmas package (2x2x2, 4x4x4, 
5x5x5), a Megaminx and a transparent cube. :) And it did only take 2 
weeks!

I going to start with the 4x4x4 and leave the others alone until I 
solve the 4x4x4. I might see how far I can get on my own. If it gets 
too frustrating then I&#x27;ll check out solutions online.

I played with the 4x4x4 for the first time last night and managed to 
to all the edges, and the centres on one face. I did this several 
times but then kept stuffing up the whole cube trying to work out the 
centres. This morning I&#x27;m having trouble getting all the edges again. 
Maybe I was just lucky last night. I didn&#x27;t think it was just luck 
since I was able to do it more than once. Oh well. I shall just keep 
working at it.

The 4x4x4 was quite stiff when I pulled it out of the box, but a bit 
of silicon spray has fixed it. The stickers appear to be the plastic 
kind so the silicon spray isn&#x27;t staining them (yay!)

On other cube purchasing news, I bought 2 spare Maestro cubes since 
my first one was so good, and it&#x27;s so difficult to find a good cube 
in Canberra, Australia.

solved cube... then i do one permutation alg and then its opposite to 
bring it back to a solved state... repeat that until you have 
memorized both the algs and then learn some more.... take your time 
though... cramming just makes you forget... as for the permutaion 
algs... i dont know how to memorize those either... because a new one 
pops up every time i solve the cube... there is no way to sit there 
and go through the sequences until you have memorized it... but any 
way i hope i have helped... =)

When I memorize an alg. I do it one alg. at a time.  I go through the 
different algs for that position (even look on different sights for 
other algs for that position) and find which ever alg I like the 
best.  Then I do the alg over and over while looking at if from the 
paper and figure out finger tricks for the alg.  Sooner or later I 
wont need to look at the paper anymore.  I keep doing the alg for 
awhile and try to do it fast.  When I can do it at top speed and dont 
have to think about the moves then the alg is pretty well learned.  
Then I go to the next alg.  Sometimes i&#x27;ll still have a little 
trouble with the alg the next day, but the alg is still 90% memorized 
so its eazy to go back and work the alg. again.  

Theres a few for each posisition because not everyone will want to 
learn the same alg, because not all algs fit everyones hands the 
same...you get that? lol

It is better to actually understand the alg, but its not a must.  For 
the F2L I understand everything im doing (mainly because i came u w/ 
it all myself) but in the LL I dont worry about being able to 
understand what happening.  I just let the LL algs. be &#x27;magic&#x27;. 
haha...

inverse algs-  ok I dont have a sheet of permutation algs infront of 
me BUT I do have some Orientation algs, so i&#x27;ll show you the inverse 
of an orientation alg.   

R U2 R2 F R F&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F R F&#x27;  

for inverse you do the alg backwards and turn the side the opposite 
way, so that algs invere would be:

F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U2 F R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U2 R&#x27;


:D......hope this helps

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    About this &quot;World Record&quot; attempt:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    For those who have been working on getting fast enough to set a new<br>
&gt; mark at the World Championship, I say ignore this &quot;World Record&quot; <br>
&gt; &quot;event.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    A &quot;World&quot; record, for those who are new to language, is where<br>
&gt; people from all over the *world* compete for it. One person competing<br>
&gt; against no one else isn&#x27;t even a competition, never mind a local<br>
&gt; regional, state, country, continent, or world competition.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    If there were something like 1000 cube mixes, even 1000 &quot;standard&quot;<br>
&gt; cube mixes, and people from all over got to try them simultaneously,<br>
&gt; that would be different. Do it live on TV and the internet, lots of<br>
&gt; places linked up, with 50 of the same mixes at a time given to a group<br>
&gt; at each place who actually mixed the cubes up, and have at it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    Sorry for the rant, but some things that are ridiculous need to be<br>
&gt; pointed out.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    Comments are welcome.<br>
<br>
I have a comment, and it is that I disagree.  I&#x27;ve watched endless <br>
world record attempts on TV and not all of them involve people from <br>
&#x27;all over the world&#x27; competing directly.  If one person can be <br>
recognised for being the best at something, then the record can and <br>
should stand.<br>
<br>
However, I believe that having 2000 attempts at breaking the record is <br>
unfair, but Jess has already put our minds at rest (right?).  His <br>
record for endurance is the one which will hopefully be proven, that&#x27;s <br>
all.  If he should beat the world record on any of the 2000+ attempts, <br>
then it can&#x27;t stand because timing conditions will not have been in <br>
place.<br>
<br>
Jess has stated that he hopes to have a stab at the world record in a <br>
special &#x27;twelve&#x27; solves session.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is <br>
plenty fair enough.  I don&#x27;t think it matters that it&#x27;s not in a <br>
competition scenario.  After all, the guys that see how high they can <br>
get by standing on the crates that they are stacking (if you follow?) <br>
don&#x27;t have a group of challengers watching and waiting to beat them.<br>
<br>
If you think you can beat the world record and you are lucky enough to <br>
get Guinness interested in your individual efforts, then I say good <br>
luck to you.  I think that Guinness will show more interest during the <br>
cube revival.  Good luck to Jess on his &#x27;twelve&#x27; solves and good luck <br>
to all the contestants who will be on the spot-light at the world <br>
championships.  I&#x27;m sure the winner will get their twelve tries too.<br>
<br>
The pressure is most definitely; ON!<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I included a few per position so that you can choose the one that is 
best for your hands. In some cases, the shortest algorithm may not 
be the fastest to perform, depending on how well one can handle 
slice moves, antislice moves, awkward moves that use 4 or 5 sides, 
etc. Also, the concept of &quot;the shortest&quot; is relative depending on 
how you count the moves. This is why I included the number of moves 
in four different countings so that you can see right away how many 
slices/antislices and double turns there are.

I have to admit that most orientation algorithm do not make much 
sense to me and it is hard to explain &quot;why&quot; they work. I remember 
them in a few &quot;macros&quot;, such as removing a corner or two, doing this 
and then putting them back. Or, removing a corner, doing a 
particular finger-shortcut and another one, etc. 

In my personal experience, some of the shortest algorithms 
are &quot;inexplicable&quot; and hard to explain why they work. In other 
words, one can find them by accident using intuition or using a 
computer but not by a logical thought sequence. As an example, take 
the shortest move for twisting three corners without moving them:

R U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; B L F&#x27; L F&#x27; L B&#x27; L2 F2

Can anyone explain this one to me? I doubt. But it works, it is 
beautiful and you can use it in your system.

On the other hand, some permutation algorithms are easy to 
understand because they are commutators (they have the structure 
ABA&#x27;B&#x27;, where A and B are macros).

To answer the question about inverses, they are quite easy. Just 
write the algorithm backwards and do backwards all the moves, too. 
This means F&#x27; instead of F, B instead B&#x27;, B2 is, of course, the same.

Good luck!

Jessica

          <div class="email-content">Wow, thanks for all the cool ideas.  <br>
I already spoke with my math teacher today, she was very thrilled <br>
about the knot theory associated with the cube.<br>
Im going to an art school so math isn&#x27;t a hard core study.  Im in the <br>
advanced class and it is all things weve done in high school.  So <br>
pretty much if we use one of the themes and present it well, the <br>
teacher is happy.  It sucks that it isn&#x27;t a challenging course but <br>
some people are struggling with it.<br>
ANyway... I taped some string to three edges of the cube and did a <br>
three edge swap and came up with some interesting stuff.  After you <br>
do the three edge swap the circle becomes a trefold knot or kinda <br>
looks like a three pointed star.  A great example of what we are <br>
looking at in our knot theory unit.  Basically we weren&#x27;t looking at <br>
formulas and stuff in this unit.  Our teacher just wanted us to know <br>
of its existance and that it is important today.  A virus is a <br>
perfect example of how a knot is applied today.  Basically the virus <br>
twists, and cuts and ties our DNA so that it produces a reaction or <br>
disease.  What scientists do is come up with something that prevents <br>
the virus to make the knot.<br>
If you think about it the cube is not just one knot but many many <br>
knots.  Slowly we unravel each knot loop by loop until we are left <br>
with a giant circle.  It may not be applied for any usefulness <br>
towards the cube but the cube is a good tool to demonstrate how a <br>
knot can be twisted or untwisted.  Thats all I&#x27;m trying to prove.<br>

If you&#x27;ve got the cube that has eight corner pieces, a skeleton, three<br>
sleeves and 24 slider thingies, then I had the same accident.  You&#x27;ll notice<br>
that two of the 24 sliders are a different shape, these two are to go with<br>
the fixed side of the skeleton (the side without the sleeves).  Once you&#x27;ve<br>
got them in place, build your whole cube, leaving one piece until last. The<br>
last piece needs brute force I&#x27;m afraid (lots!).  Please don&#x27;t sue me if<br>
something snaps though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt;I am completely left handed, (except for using the computer mouse).<br>

It is weird.  I guess the left / right hand stuff is not that cut and dry, <br>
at least in terms of cubing.<br>

When I started cubing I wanted to get my RIGHT hand doing more things, so <br>
started forcing myself to do all my scrambling with my right hand (afterall, <br>
30% of cubing is spent scrambling).  This helped my right hand learn <br>

hand.  But I still need to work on it a fair bit.<br>

<br>
Hi David.<br>
<br>
If I have understood you correctly, you are getting sub-minute times (which <br>
is great: congratulations!) using a method and moves that you have developed <br>
yourself.  A few people in this club (myself included) have manged to work <br>
out their own solutions, but I think only a few of those would have been <br>
able to get such fast times with their own method.  I am very impressed: <br>
that&#x27;s amazing!  The moves I used are lost in the haze of the far more <br>
effient moves that I found quite soon after, but my own method took four or <br>
five minutes to complete; it was : face+layer, opposite corners, remaining <br>
edges.  It is possible to fix all the edges at the end using one algorithm <br>
(or was it two?; sequcences in your terminology, if I understand you <br>
correctly), and the hardest part was getting the corners the right way after <br>
solving one side.  It took me ages because I could only solve corners if <br>
they were in one state, so I have to keep going through phases until they <br>
were just so.<br>
<br>
So: WOW!  What is your general approach to solving the cube?  And how do you <br>
find your moves?  Is it trial and error?  Do you use any programs to help?<br>
<br>
S.<br>
<br>
PS welcome to the club, by the way!  If you do not know, the chat room is <br>
quite active on the weekends, it seems especially Sunday late afternoon / <br>
evenings UK time.  I suppose it might get even livlier at evenings US time, <br>
but I would never know!<br>
<br>
PPS what is this &quot;game&quot; that you recommend?<br>
<br>
Sorry to post so many questions...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for your answers.
I asked this question because it&#x27;s *very* difficult for me to remember
algorithms (or sequences) I do not understand. Don&#x27;t know exactly why.
Maybe because my mind is just not good for this. Or I&#x27;m psychologicaly
stuck because I don&#x27;t like this way of thinking.
The image you propose is good. Algorithms are like words, with a
meaning of their own. But when I speak, I always think about the words
I use too, they never come naturaly.
An advantage of understanding what I do on the 3x3x3: Today I received
a Megaminx, and had no problem applying similar techniques and solved
it quite fast.

But don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I really would like to be able to learn
and remember tons of mystic sequences!

Gilles.

PS: I broke my record yesterday: 15 seconds. Ok, that was a lucky cube ;-)

It&#x27;s good to hear that I&#x27;m not alone!  Although I noticed that in<br>
a video of you solving one handed, it was done with your right hand.<br>
Is this something that changed after a while?  Anyway, I even have<br>
the same experience that one handed with my right hand is just<br>
&quot;clunky&quot; and locks up.  I wonder if it has anything to do with the<br>
fact that as I&#x27;m solving normally, the right hand typically does<br>
larger, less precise movements (e.g. triggers), and the left hand<br>
is responsible for alignment of over/under triggers and such.<br>

lol, I too am right handed and mostly use my right hand while 
cubing.  And when I one-hand cube its with my left hand :D

  Thanks so much Robert!!! I got it back together just as you 
described. One small note though, my cube only has only 12 sliders, 8 
corner pieces, a skeleton and 3 sleeves. When I was down to the last 
piece I simply slipped the corner piece in position and slid the 
piece over the sliders and onto the corner piece. Worked great. 
Thanks again!!

I guess that&#x27;s pretty cool. 
Here are some other ideas:
I suppose the question that could be asked then is if you tape 
string to different parts of the cube what knots and links are 
possible by mixing the cube up. In particular, you could try messing 
the cube up and solving it (possibly in a simplistic way such as 
doing a 3 cycle 3 times. Is the result the unknot or not? I guess 
that&#x27;s the sort of direction you might go with this. Does 
the &quot;unseen&quot; twisting of centres have any effect? You could also 
look at links. Is it possible to jam the cube in some way (i.e. it 
can&#x27;t twist anymore because of the knotting going on around it). 
Which positions aren&#x27;t possible? These last two questions may be 
quite difficult to answer of course.
Here&#x27;s another, probably difficult question: how many isomorphism 
classes of knots can be so obtained? (Isomorphism in the category of 
knots, to be more specific.) If you&#x27;ve got a 4x4x4 you could look at 
doing the same sort of thing there too.
Then the really good questions would come from looking at nxnxn 
cubes and seeing what kind of results are possible. You could also 
try higher dimensional analogues with tesseracts and so forth.
Provided the string is attached to different pieces, does the end 
result depend on the point of the piece to which you attach the end 
of the string? Can you find a continuous [0,1]-indexed sequence of 
homeomorphisms (I can&#x27;t remember what that&#x27;s called - perhaps 
isotopic, I&#x27;ll check and confirm some other time) that show they are 
equivalent, if indeed they are? What are the possible linking 
numbers of the knots?


(PS On the Golden ratio I forgot to mention that the ratio does not 
depend on the starting points of the Fibonacci sequence (if you 
define it like this), at least provided the product of the two 
initial values is non-negative (and the sum positive).  Other 
Fibonacci type sequences have similar results with different ratios. 
Probably, though I haven&#x27;t looked into it, if you look at linear 
difference equations with constant coefficients (and zero constant 
term) such that the characteristic equation doesn&#x27;t have repeated 
roots - and actually quite possibly if it does, if my brain is 
working)) hen you could achieve similar results. I mention this as 
an aside because I don&#x27;t think you are going to do the golden ratio.)

How fast could you solve it?  What kind of average is possible?  <br>
<br>
As this is no longer a case of a randomly scrambled cube, it is only <br>
a theoretical average.<br>
<br>
I took this mixing alg from Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer app:<br>
<br>
B&#x27;  L2  U  B&#x27;  D  L&#x27;  B  R&#x27;  F&#x27;  L&#x27;  F2  U  B2  D&#x27;  F  D&#x27;  U2  F2  <br>
R&#x27;  D&#x27;  L  R&#x27;  B  U&#x27;  D2  <br>
<br>
and will practice solving it over and over.  <br>
<br>
I would be curious to see what kind of times would be generated, and <br>
also to see if people using the same method (eg, F2L) would end up <br>
with the same LL, end stage or same number of moves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know exactly what you mean. I don&#x27;t even pay attention most of the

It will be interesting to see the results of that experiment you&#x27;re 
doing.

&gt; <br>
&gt; I bought a cube from your Ebay auction in January or so.  Back then <br>
I <br>

Hi Robert,<br>

Glad to hear that cube is working out for you, and that you&#x27;ve gotten <br>
your average down so far!<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you think you will be attending the Championships in Canada?<br>
<br>
I hope to, but I&#x27;m also planning to live in Yosemite for a month or <br>
two and eventually climb El Capitan, and I&#x27;m not absolutely sure if <br>
they will conflict...  I&#x27;m definitely still training with the cube, <br>

I totally agree with your reasoning.  I find it very hard to do 
triggers with my left hand, and I always assumed that my left hand 
was just not precise enough.  However, after further analysis, I 
realized that when a left-handed trigger move got blocked, it was 
usually my right hand&#x27;s fault for not maintaining proper alignment of 
the cube!  

For the first 3 years of my speed-cubing interest, my cubing was 
completely dominated by my right hand. Everything else that I do in 
life is right handed, including playing the guitar... which actually 
means that my LEFT hand is the one on the fret board.  After playing 
guitar for nearly 13 years, my left hand is capable of playing really 
fast and intricate riffs.

So for the last 5 or 6 months, I have been training my left hand on 
the cube.  This has been really frustrating, but now I can do pretty 
much everything &quot;lefty&quot; as well.  I think this is definitely the best 
way to solve, and I am sure that given enough time my left hand will 
become almost as good as my right... I just hope it doesn&#x27;t take 13 
years!

&gt; I would be curious to see what kind of times would be generated, <br>
and <br>
&gt; also to see if people using the same method (eg, F2L) would end up <br>
&gt; with the same LL, end stage or same number of moves.<br>
<br>
Well I thought that was pretty interesting so here is what I came up <br>
with.  I did an average of that scramble Here is what i got:<br>
<br>
1. 30 2. 28 3. 24 4. 22 5. 21 6. 22 7. 23 8. 20 9. 21 10. 19 11. 20 <br>
12. 21<br>
<br>
I was practically sleeping when I started that is why I got that 30, <br>
but I think if I did another 12 on the same scramble, I would get <br>
20.9 average.  I normally average in the high 25s.  I thought it <br>
would be cool to see how other people do on this scramble.  Here is <br>
how I fixed it:  <br>
<br>
1. F&#x27; U F2                               Top Corners 1sec<br>
2. M&#x27; E R U&#x27; M U R2 (R2M2L) U M U&#x27;    First Three Edges 4sec<br>
3. [U2 L U&#x27; R2 U L&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U&#x27;]          Bottom Corners 4sec<br>
4. (L&#x27;R&#x27;) F&#x27; M F (M&#x27;R&#x27;) F M&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; M&#x27; F2 M2 F&#x27; R&#x27;3 Bottom Edges <br>
6sec<br>
5. (M2R2)F M2 F2 M F  Simultaneously put last two edges in 3sec<br>
6. (RL) [U&#x27; M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M U M U M U2 M&#x27; U2] Flip edges in M layer 3sec<br>
<br>
(R&#x27;3 is = to R&#x27; R&#x27; R&#x27;) I did this so I do not have to rotate the cube.<br>
<br>
It took me forever to figure the notation out.  But here is how I <br>
solve the cube fast.  It would be different if I were doing it for <br>
fewer turns.  <br>
<br>
Step 3 is a memorized move off of speedcubing.com<br>
Step 6 is kind of a self-taught memorized move <br>
<br>
I am working on learning algs to get rid of step 6.  I think the algs <br>
would drop off about 14 moves on this solve and 3 sec on this <br>
average. Which would mean I would be averaging almost 17s for this <br>
scramble!  That is good motivation to keep working on learning algs.  <br>
<br>
Anyway anyone want to count my moves for this solve?  <br>
<br>
A nice count would be like 59 if you count things like (L&#x27;R&#x27;) R2 M, <br>
and M2 as one move. A mean count would be like 100, if you count R2 <br>
and M as two moves and M2 as four.  So how many moves is this?<br>
<br>
Well enough putting it off I must study for finals!<br>

Well Lucas, looks like my &quot;zen like state&quot; is 19 seconds.

I did just what you were saying.  I did an average of that scramble 
you posted (and I almost know it by heart now :S) haha.  First I just 
speed solved the cube, and I got a time of 27.2 seconds.  Then I went 
back through the cube until I figured out exactly how I solved it the 
first time (one move took FOREVER to figure out how I did it, because 
there was another way that I thought I had done it when I was going 
back through it) lol.  

After knowing exactly what I did the first time I solved it, I speed 
solved it again a couple times, (21 and 20 seconds)...then I felt I 
was ready to take an average on it.  
   times were : 18,18,20,19,18,(20),19,(17),19,18,18,18  
                      =18.5+.5  =19 

I dont know why I took an average of 12 lol, should of just did 10. 
oh well.

I even wrote down ALL the moves I used to solve. Moves were as 
follows:

2x2x2: x z&#x27; (R&#x27; U2 R2 L2 U2)

2X2X3: (D2 R) y (L&#x27; F2 L D2 U F U&#x27;)

next corner/edge pair(w/ last top edge):(R D) z2 y&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)

last corner/edge pair:  z2 (D2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R D R&#x27; D&#x27; R D2) y (L D&#x27; L&#x27;)

OLL alg:  z2  (L F L&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27;)

PLL alg:  y&#x27;  (B2 L U L&#x27; B2) x&#x27; (R B&#x27; R B R2)

Just some #&#x27;s: 

      total moves = 57
      turns per second on very first solve = 2.1
      turns per second on average = 3
      time wasted looking for pieces in very first solve = 8.2
      % of time looking for pieces =  30%
               

I put all the moves so maybe you guys ( if you wanted) could check 
out exactly what I do if your not for sure.  Umm... I dont really 
know why I put those #&#x27;s lol .enjoy!.

p.s. I guess what this means is that even if I cut out all my time 
looking for pieces some of you guys are STILL faster than me.  So I 
will have to cut LOTS of time off from looking for pieces AND improve 
on my system if I wanna catch up to you guys.

not much of a difference but oh well....<br>

redkbrandon- I counted 64 moves for you, and thats counting R&#x27; R2 and <br>

<br>
-- <br>
(Hopefully this will display in a fixed-width font)<br>
<br>
First, build a 2x2x2 block (as in the petrus method)<br>
<br>
       - - -<br>
       - - -<br>
       - - -<br>

       - o o<br>
       - o o<br>
       - - -<br>
<br>
Then, attach three 2x2x1 blocks.<br>
<br>
one:<br>
<br>
       - - -<br>
       - x x<br>
       - x x<br>
<br>
- - -  - x x  x x -  - - - <br>
- - -  - o o  o o -  - - - <br>
- - -  - o o  o o -  - - - <br>
<br>
       - o o<br>
       - o o<br>
       - - -<br>
<br>
two:<br>

       - - -<br>
       - x x<br>
       - x x<br>

- - -  - x x  x x -  - - - <br>

       - - -<br>

<br>
       x o o<br>
       x o o<br>
       - x x<br>
<br>
This much can be achieved without any memorised move sequences, and leaves 4<br>
corners and 3 edges to solve (forming a tripod shape). There are only two<br>
possibilities for edge orientations. One is when they are already oriented,<br>
and the other is when two need to be flipped - this case can be done in only 4<br>
moves (or sometimes 3 if you join with the previous step).<br>
<br>
&gt;From here, it is just a matter of how to stage the final step. How many<br>
different configurations are possible after the edges have been oriented? How<br>
many after the edges have been oriented AND permuted?<br>
<br>
The tripod shape seems to have three advantages:<br>
<br>
1. It gives you more maneuverability (see for example how easily the edges can<br>
   be oriented)<br>
2. There is one less edge to worry about than in the &quot;last layer&quot; approach.<br>
3. The remaining configurations may be more symmetrical, resulting in less<br>
   sequences to memorise.<br>
<br>
Now, one reason for writing this email is that I would like to write a program<br>
that will calculate the number of possible cube positions given certain<br>
constraints. First, there are the natural constraints of the cube which are<br>
always present. Then, there are user imposed constraints. Finally the program<br>
should filter out any positions that are symmetrical with existing positions.<br>
If anyone would like to help me with this program, (particularly the<br>
mathematical side of it), please send me an email to rheise@...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have thought of a possible improvement that may apply to more than<br>
just one method.<br>
<br>
To demonstrate, consider the petrus method:<br>
<br>
1. solve a 2x2x3 block<br>
2. complete the first two layers by adding a 3x2x1 slice<br>
3. complete the last layer<br>
<br>
One approach for step 2 is:<br>
<br>
a. build a 2x2x1 section<br>
b. add on a 1x2x1 section<br>
<br>
For (a), you can choose between 4 starting points and pick the easiest one. If<br>
you find a good one, it can be done in 2, 3 or 4 moves. Otherwise it can take<br>
about 8 moves. Sometimes there are no good options among the 4 starting<br>
points.<br>
<br>
But now consider that there are actually 8 different 3x2x1 slices to choose<br>
from in step 2. The slice you choose doesn&#x27;t have to join with step 1 with<br>
matching colours, it just needs to be the same shape. In the final step, you<br>
can slide this slice back to where it should go in just one move.<br>
<br>
This gives you 8 different options for step 2a, greatly increasing your<br>
chances of finding a good option.<br>
<br>
Once you get to the final layer, you have to be able to recognise all the<br>
patterns with three of the pieces being a different colour, but it&#x27;s not as<br>
difficult as you might think - try it. Of course, some systems for the last<br>
layer may be easier to handle than others.<br>
<br>
This idea also applies, with more opportunities, in the tripod approach<br>
described in my last email.<br>

If you viewed this through the Yahoo! Groups web page, it would not have<br>

          <div class="email-content">This was a lot of fun! Don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t ever thought of doing 
something like this before. I spent a few minutes trying to find the 
best possible solution by solving it several times slowly and 
checking all the alternatives. I&#x27;ve never ever done that either 
before! I found a really good solution (see below) pretty soon.

After ~10 times I was ready to time it. It took ~5 tries to get down 
to a plateau of 14-15 seconds. But it really didn&#x27;t feel very zen. It 
took ~10 more attempts until things suddenly started flowing as they 
should, and I was doing 12-12.5 seconds. I used the Bonde Timer.

I really don&#x27;t know how you guys handle the notation! It just doesn&#x27;t 
mix with my cubing brain. I got the wrong result 1/3 of the time. 
This is why I did my animation applet...

When you do this, you really notice any deficiencies in your cube!


My solution:
(The steps bleed into each other a bit)

1. 2x2x2 B&#x27; L2 F2
2. 2x2x3 U2 L2
3. twist edges U&#x27; B F&#x27; L&#x27; F
4. 2x3x3 U2 L2 U2 L&#x27;
5+6. twist &amp; place corners B&#x27; U F2 U&#x27; B U F2 U2
7. place edges L&#x27; D2 L F&#x27; B D2 F B&#x27; L D2

32 moves in 12.5 sec is 2.6 moves/sec. Someone else can probably do 
the same solution faster? That would be fun.

There are 5(!) 12 turn solutions for the final layer position, 
instead of the 18 turn one I used, so you can get it down to 26-27 
moves that way. See position 40 at 
http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bhelmste/cube/solutions_567.html

I also made an animation for it, since I had to anyway to figure out 
the notation. It will be at http://lar5.com/cube/zen.html as soon as 
my ISPs ftp server is up again.

I have not touch rubik&#x27;s cubes in a few months and recently started <br>
again. <br>
And I was thinking something! <br>
<br>
I agree. This would be fun! <br>
<br>
#1 Solve same randomized situation. <br>
#2 Unlimited inspection, study and practice. <br>
#3 use video and need to show real clock or stopwatch to avoid <br>
modification on PC like deleting flames. <br>
<br>
So even beginner could get world record after practice. <br>
But this requires host like Jess. <br>
Is anybody interested in hosting? <br>

          <div class="email-content">I was able to get all edges + centres on one face + half centres on 
many other faces, fairly quickly. Over the last 2 days I hadn&#x27;t 
really progressed beyond that though. :(  I didn&#x27;t really know what I 
was doing. I remembered there had been some debate a little while ago 
about whether it was better to do edges first or centres first, but I 
couldn&#x27;t remember what the consensus had been. I hadn&#x27;t paid too much 
attention to those posts because I didn&#x27;t have a 4x4x4 at that point. 
Anyway, I just started playing and realised that my natural instinct 
was to start solving edges first.

After two days and not much progress, I decided to look around at 
different approaches to see if a different method would suit me 
better. I found that with the regular cube doing cross->F2L->LL fits 
in my brain better than 2x2x2->2x2x3->F2L->LL, so I wondered if a 
different 4x4x4 approach might help. I read the intro stuff to Chris 
H&#x27;s revenge solution and had a go at centres first.

I was trying really hard to resist looking up solutions, and just 
read ideas instead and see what I could do with them. Unfortunately, 
I have little will power with these things :/ I ended up reading a 
few of the algs on Chris&#x27; page. Not many though, only 4 or 5 to get 
me started.

I&#x27;ll try and resist looking at it again for a little while and play 
around with a centres first approach. (I didn&#x27;t actually memorise any 
of Chris&#x27; algs, I just tried a few of them once.)

So yes, my 4x4x4 is now solved, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t say that it 
was entirely my own work. :/

I&#x27;m going to leave the 5x5x5 until I have the 4x4x4 under control. 
After the 5x5x5, I&#x27;ll move on to the megaminx.

I&#x27;ve never played with a skewb diamond. I have a regular skewb 
(somewhere!) and found it to be rather unimpressive. The diamond 
looks a bit more exciting though.

Jasmine.

BTW, Chris, I found your revenge solution easy to follow (well, the 
bits I looked at anyway).

<br>
I think that someone needs to put in the time to make an effective<br>
design for a 4x4x4 because the only reason no one has made a decent<br>
one is that they do not sell well. If someone made a good one however,<br>
they could sell them online to just cubists. Maybe I should just stop<br>
waiting and make my own... Well if I ever come up witha really good<br>
idea, I&#x27;ll tell all of you guys.<br>

I don&#x27;t have a 5x5x5, but I&#x27;ve solved one more than enough times on<br>
oinkleburger (along with even larger cubes).  My latest average (on<br>
a real cube, not an applet) for the 4x4x4 was about 20 seconds<br>

The only actual time reference I have is someone else here, who<br>

   Thanks for your response. Please allow me to clarify a point or
two. I was addressing the &quot;fastest solve&quot; record not the &quot;average&quot;
solve record. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t make that clear.

   I take your point. There is, however, a difference in the kinds of
records. If the record you&#x27;re going after is how long it takes to
solve 2000 randomly mixed cubes, then this can be tried by anyone at
anytime. This is scattershot and there is a law of large numbers that
means that the random mixes in large enough numbers are reasonably
similar...probably.

   We agree on this.

   This is where we differ.

   You are right, they don&#x27;t, but they have a reliable and enforceable
standard of measuring height.

    In my view the &quot;12 solves&quot; fails this fairness test for at least
two reasons. One is because there is no standard of measurment for
isolated tries. It can only be fair if anyone who is tested faces the
same challenge (not a seemingly similar challenge) and faces *unknown*
mixes. This problem is partly because there is no way to agree upon a
&quot;blind&quot; set of mixes that anyone can try at another time. There is no
way to keep that &quot;blind&quot; set of mixes secret, and if they are not
secret they can be analysed and practiced.
   Another reason is that the &quot;12 solves&quot; do not meet the &quot;same
challenge&quot; requirement is because the number is too small. IMO it&#x27;s
simple not a large enough random sample. Someone could meet up with
several mixes that happen to fit well with his or her style.

   Understand that I&#x27;m not knocking Jess&#x27; efforts or talent.
   I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for Guinness to wait until the end to time
12 cubes. In sport world records are usually set when the athlete is
fresh. This is like telling a runner go run 30 miles then we&#x27;ll time
you in the mile.

   This is not to say that this Guinness &quot;World Record&quot; event can&#x27;t be
fun, I&#x27;m just saying that it need not take the wind out of the sails
of those who have been working hard to beat the world record at next
year&#x27;s official competition.

   David J

   That&#x27;s what I meant. Thanks!

   Very good. I always thought that that was the point of the cube,
besides the amazing mechanism, and the incredible leap of intuition
that it took for Rubik to design it. For me it&#x27;s the only way to go. 

>  [unsnip] but I think only a few of those would have been able to
get such fast times with their own method. &lt;

   Really? I&#x27;m surprised to hear this. I&#x27;d have thought that what I
do/did was commonplace. Besides, I could be vastly more efficient
overall and in particular. 

> I am very impressed: that&#x27;s amazing! The moves I used are lost in
the haze of the far more effient moves that I found quite soon after,
but my own method took four or five minutes to complete; it was :
face+layer, opposite corners, remaining edges. &lt;

    Perhaps if you had stuck with your own ways, you would have found
those better methods, and sequences on your own.

> It is possible to fix all the edges at the end using one algorithm
(or was it two?; sequcences in your terminology, if I understand you
correctly), &lt;

   If this is a question, you&#x27;re asking about moving and flipping over
the edges of the last level. Good question. 

   In all cases the movement of the edges (without flipping) can be
done with one sequence. Also, with one sequence I can flip any two
over, or flip all four over (without moving them). So that&#x27;s half of it. 

  I know several &quot;combo&quot; sequences, which do both - move and flip. But
I don&#x27;t have the complete set, yet. 

> and the hardest part was getting the corners the right way after
solving one side. It took me ages because I could only solve corners
if they were in one state, so I have to keep going through phases
until they were just so. &lt;

   Once I developed two sequences, one each for solving, respectively,
all the last four corners&#x27; orientations, then their positions, the
times started coming down drastically. The second time I solved a cube
it took me and hour; the third time took 15 minutes.

   But this is pattern recognition, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s all in how you look
at it.

> So: WOW! What is your general approach to solving the cube? &lt;

   Comprehension and looking ahead. The more information I have about
what the next steps require, the more efficient I can be. If the next
thing I do can solve two things at once, that&#x27;s better than only
solving one; solving three&#x27;s better than solving two. If you look at
it one way I use an 8 step algorithm, but I rarely need to take all
eight steps.
   When the sequences are combined there are fewer moves. Generally I
can solve the cube in 54 moves, sometimes in as few as 36, not
counting &quot;lucky&quot; mixes.

> And how do you find your moves? Is it trial and error? &lt;

   Not really. Sometimes when I look for a solution to a particular
problem I won&#x27;t touch the cube, but try to think it out. [I recently
got a 4x4x4 and that&#x27;s how I approached it. Everything I tried worked,
so there wasn&#x27;t any error, so it really wasn&#x27;t trial and error.]
Sometimes I find new sequences at speed. Sometimes I try things and
see what turns up, but again, no error...Exploration means never
having to say you are lost. :)

> Do you use any programs to help? &lt;

   No, though it might be fun to lay out a few.

   I&#x27;m rarely on line weekends, but I&#x27;ll visit if I can. I believe
that I&#x27;m 8 hours west of London, so 6-8PM there is 10AM-noon here.

> PPS what is this &quot;game&quot; that you recommend? &lt;

   Start with a solved cube and make a hidden move, hand it to a
buddy. He/she puts it back. Your buddy makes a move and hands it to
you. You put it back. Then two moves...then three moves...etc. A
general approach is, for example, to get to where you can solve any
four before you work on five. 

> Sorry to post so many questions...

   Not a problem. Thanks for the interest.
   How long have you been speedcubing? What kind of times do you turn
in, and how many moves?

Centres first is definitely the way to go, although I&#x27;m glad I first 
did it edges first because I can use the algorithms I figured out 
there to do the revenge blindfolded.

If you get the chance in Scrabble (and it&#x27;s quite unlikely) play 
oxyphenbutazone across 3 triple word scores - if these include the 
first o, the b and the final e you&#x27;ll get a multiplier of 27 on your 
word score - if you also play the z you can get a double letter 
score on it and maybe even play it across another word. You can get 
560 just for the z! Like this you can get a score of close to 1700 
for the one word which should win you the game.

Maybe, but I can solve the 5x5x5 quicker than I can do a corner 3

Megaminx? Piece of cake.
I got one yesterday for the first time and solved it in 20 minutes.

I was very surprised when I realized how easy it was, if you apply a
very simple layer by layer 3x3x3 method.

<br>
Is this really true or is this a great exageration?  How long do each<br>
of these puzzles take you?<br>
<br>
Regardless, there are likely several different factors here -<br>
practice, method efficiency, and puzzle &quot;movability.&quot;  I&#x27;m guessing<br>
you&#x27;ve spent much more time practicing the 5x5x5 (either in physical<br>
or applet form) than you have on the megaminx.  Each of these can<br>
have a great impact on your time:<br>
<br>
1) Practice is obvious - the more the practice the faster you&#x27;ll be<br>
(in theory, anyways).  Also, extra practice usually improves both<br>
solution efficiency and puzzle movability.<br>
<br>
2) Improved solution efficiency is twofold - move count and &quot;delay&quot;<br>
reduction.  I found that most of my time was spent in looking for<br>
pieces.  You (in general, not you specifically) may have a method<br>
that uses very few moves, but requires difficult piece location,<br>
making for longer pauses, or you may have a solution that is<br>
virtually pause free, but takes an enormous amount of moves.  The<br>
answer (as with all puzzles) is to find the solution in the middle<br>
with a minimum of both pauses and moves producing the best time.<br>
<br>
3) Puzzle movability is again obvious.  It&#x27;s just a matter of the<br>
amount of impact that this has.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a new<br>
megaminx (especially with a different color scheme) gave me a time<br>
twice that of what I currently have.  They can get really, really<br>
bad!<br>
<br>
Btw, the corner 3 cycle on the megaminx is only 12 moves, if done<br>
right - 8 disregarding orientation, or 15 with a slightly less<br>
efficient algorithm.  If those 8-15 moves take longer than the<br>
250 - 300 that it is likely to take to solve the 5x5x5, then I&#x27;d<br>
say there&#x27;s a problem with your megaminx puzzle (at the very least<br>
it&#x27;s not lubed)!<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just tried the theoretical fastest average thing, using the same 
scramble that you guys used.  Here was the average

(18) (16) 16 18 18 16 17 18 16 16 (pop) 16 16 = 17.2

Here are the moves I used to solve it

B L&#x27; F2 L2 B: Forms cross and keeps blue/orange pair intact
F&#x27; U2 F: places orange/blue pair
U&#x27; B2 R B2 R&#x27;: places blue/red pair
U2 F U&#x27; F2 L F L&#x27;: places orange/green pair
B&#x27; U2 B U&#x27; L U L&#x27;: places green/red pair
R&#x27; F&#x27; R L&#x27; U&#x27; L U R&#x27; F R: orientation case
F2 U&#x27; L R&#x27; F2 L&#x27; R U&#x27; F2: permutation case

This was 46 moves so at fastest 2.875 moves/sec and at my slowest 
2.556 moves/sec

What I did was to just do the scramble and try to figure out 
different ways to do it.  I found a two or three ways to do it in 46 
moves but this one had orientation and permutations cases that I 
liked a little bit better.  I did notice that after I had the 
solution memorized I spent about 80% of my concentration on keeping 
my cube lined up after each turn.  I also realized exactly how much 
time I spend looking for pieces, anywhere from hardly any pauses at 
all to 10-12 seconds based on these runs.  Heh heh guess I know what 
I need to work on :)  This was fun, I&#x27;d like to see if I can find a 
solution better than 46 moves and try this again.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, Lars, this is really phenomenal. 32 (or 26) moves so quickly - <br>
I am amazed. Do you think this was a lucky case for you, or can you <br>
pretty much do around 35 moves if you try slow and multiple cases? <br>
<br>
I wonder if we can find a shorter algorithm than the scrambling one <br>
for this position using just our brains and no computers. I have to <br>
admit that I am less interested in how fast one can do a particular <br>
sequence of moves, actually.<br>
<br>
I sent the scrambling algorithm to Mirek Goljan and to my surprise, <br>
without knowing your solution, he generated a different solution, <br>
but the first 5 moves are exactly the same as yours! He used a <br>
modified layer-by-layer approach that he uses to solve the cube for <br>
the least number of moves. He thinks that this is not a coincidence <br>
and it reflects the fact that the cube is not randomized well .... <br>
Anyway, here is his solution with 29 moves:<br>
<br>
B&#x27; L2 F2 U2 L2 F U F&#x27; B2 L U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B L&#x27; F&#x27; L B2 L B&#x27; L2 F L&#x27; B U D <br>
L2 D&#x27; (29)<br>
<br>
Note that after the first 11 moves, you have essentially 2 layers <br>
solved! After those 11 moves, you will have a three-cycle of corners <br>
and a three-cycle of edges (with flips) all constrained to the L <br>
side. I wonder if those 11 moves could be a good starting point to <br>
solve the position in fewer than 25 moves (the length of the <br>
scrambling algorithm).<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>
<br>
&gt; This was a lot of fun! Don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t ever thought of <br>
doing <br>
&gt; something like this before. I spent a few minutes trying to find <br>
the <br>
&gt; best possible solution by solving it several times slowly and <br>
&gt; checking all the alternatives. I&#x27;ve never ever done that either <br>
&gt; before! I found a really good solution (see below) pretty soon.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; After ~10 times I was ready to time it. It took ~5 tries to get <br>
down <br>
&gt; to a plateau of 14-15 seconds. But it really didn&#x27;t feel very zen. <br>
It <br>
&gt; took ~10 more attempts until things suddenly started flowing as <br>
they <br>
&gt; should, and I was doing 12-12.5 seconds. I used the Bonde Timer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I really don&#x27;t know how you guys handle the notation! It just <br>
doesn&#x27;t <br>
&gt; mix with my cubing brain. I got the wrong result 1/3 of the time. <br>
&gt; This is why I did my animation applet...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When you do this, you really notice any deficiencies in your cube!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My solution:<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. 2x2x2 B&#x27; L2 F2<br>
&gt; 2. 2x2x3 U2 L2<br>
&gt; 3. twist edges U&#x27; B F&#x27; L&#x27; F<br>
&gt; 4. 2x3x3 U2 L2 U2 L&#x27;<br>
&gt; 5+6. twist &amp; place corners B&#x27; U F2 U&#x27; B U F2 U2<br>
&gt; 7. place edges L&#x27; D2 L F&#x27; B D2 F B&#x27; L D2<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 32 moves in 12.5 sec is 2.6 moves/sec. Someone else can probably <br>
do <br>
&gt; the same solution faster? That would be fun.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are 5(!) 12 turn solutions for the final layer position, <br>
&gt; instead of the 18 turn one I used, so you can get it down to 26-27 <br>
&gt; moves that way. See position 40 at <br>
&gt; http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bhelmste/cube/solutions_567.html<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all, finally solved my first cube while blindfolded!  I had tried <br>
a while back and all I could manage was the 2x2x2.  Then I looked at <br>
Richard Carr&#x27;s page for his blindfold method.  I never really looked <br>
at it much, I just sort of glanced at the pictures and noticed that <br>
the pieces were numbered, that&#x27;s all I really got out of it.  Well <br>
anyway I was trying to think how to memorize the cube quickly, and I <br>
thought about how Richard numbers the cube.  So I sat down with a <br>
sheet of paper, drew out a cube and came up with a number system that <br>
made sense to me.  I memorized that system, then I sat down with my <br>
cube and scrambled it.  When I took the blindfold off for that solve <br>
I thought I was done but the cube was 5 moves away from solved.  Then <br>
I tried it again and my cube was still pretty scrambled when I <br>
thought I was done.  Then the third time I actually got it!  Took me <br>
about an hour to do it the third time.  Anyway I was just REALLY <br>
excited to finally get it.  Thanks Richard for the hint, I didn&#x27;t <br>
actually study your method but it gave me a hint in the right <br>
direction :)<br>

It&#x27;s definitely a lucky case. I&#x27;m not sure how lucky - I&#x27;ve only ever 
done this once. Based on getting a 42.5 average when thinking hard on 
13 cubes (http://lar5.com/cube/examples.html), I&#x27;m pretty sure I 
could get under 40 if I get to try until I find the best way. And if 
I get to use the Helmstetter index, that will take 3-5 more moves off.

Now, doing those 13 solutions, I did feel unusually lucky, and since 
they too came from the Bonde mixer (old Sunday competition), my 
scientific training compels me to mention that they may not be 100% 
mixed. Maybe 25 moves isn&#x27;t really enough? How do you find out?

Then again, I hadn&#x27;t really done that Real Hard Thinking stuff in 
many years, so it&#x27;s hard to know what &quot;usual&quot; luck would mean 
nowadays.

Does the Helmstetter index count as using computers? If so, you may

Not too surprising. Once you see the first one, the next four really 
stand out. If you&#x27;re looking for building &quot;blocks&quot;.

Turn 11 has to be B&#x27;

B&#x27; L2 F2 U2 L2 F U F&#x27; B2 L B&#x27;

Using Helmstetters index I get exactly 25. I doubt there is anything better.

B&#x27; L2 F2 U2 L2 F U F&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; F2 U2 D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B U2 F&#x27; U F D2 F2 L2 U

That&#x27;s Goljans 11, 12 from the index, and 2 to clean up. Out of 25 
moves 12 are half turns. And of the remaining 13, 9 are in 3 &quot;x U x&#x27;&quot; 
sequences. Whatever that may mean...

I put this one one the animation page as well: http://lar5.com/cube/zen.html

It&#x27;s really true. Lately, my 5x5x5 times are getting better and 
worse than 2&#x27;30&quot; is really quite disappointing. (I&#x27;ve only just 
started on megaminx because before I first ever touched it a sticker 
fell off - I solved it like that but before I went on it again a lot 
more fell off. I&#x27;ve recently got around this problem.)
Anyway, my 3-cycle move (like a LL permutation so I need to preserve 
orientation etc.) is 72 moves or if I need to do the other way 144 
moves as there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to try to invert a 72 move 
algorithm so I do it twice. That&#x27;s if the 3 are all adjacent in one 
layer. If they aren&#x27;t it&#x27;s even longer!
To do the algorithm 3 times on my megaminx takes about 5 minutes or 
100 seconds a go - so half the time it takes 200 seconds which is a 
lot longer than it takes to solve the 5x5x5.
My puzzle isn&#x27;t lubricated (I&#x27;ve only ever lubricated a couple of 
3x3x3&#x27;s because the large puzzles seem fragile) and I can get less 
than a move a second out of my megaminx. Sometimes it jams a lot so 
I need to go 4 times round the wrong direction instead of once in 
the right direction.

I&#x27;m really looking for a low move count method. Delay is not as big

Evidently I&#x27;m not doing it right!
I can cycle them in 8 moves if I don&#x27;t care about orientation or 
what happens to the edges but I&#x27;m thinking like LL of the cube so 
not to disturb other stuff (like if it&#x27;s the last thing to do). To 
correct all that other stuff takes me another 64 moves.

I can&#x27;t remember the last time I needed 300 moves to solve the 5x5x5.

No problem - I&#x27;ve only got the &quot;beginner&quot; method on the web anyway. 
I&#x27;m working on intermediate and advanced levels but I don&#x27;t think 
I&#x27;ll be good enough to master even the intermediate level.
The advanced level is cool though. Fast people such as yourself 
would probably be able to solve the cube in 2 minutes (including 
memorization) with it.

&gt;    Really? I&#x27;m surprised to hear this. I&#x27;d have thought that what I<br>
&gt;do/did was commonplace. Besides, I could be vastly more efficient<br>
&gt;overall and in particular.<br>
<br>
I think you will find that most people have pooled together ideas and moves <br>
as part of the process of refining their method.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     Perhaps if you had stuck with your own ways, you would have found<br>
&gt;those better methods, and sequences on your own.<br>
<br>
Maybe, but for me the sharing aspect of cubing - down to the moves <br>
themselves - is part of what it makes it so much fun!<br>
<br>
&gt;    How long have you been speedcubing? What kind of times do you turn<br>
&gt;in, and how many moves?<br>
<br>
For about 6 months, after a 20 year break.<br>
I have not timed myself for a while, and have been concentrating on getting <br>
my number of moves down, but between 30 and 40 seconds.<br>
About 55 moves, going down to 50 moves once I have completed learning my <br>
current set.<br>
<br>
Best of luck completing your set of combo moves.  It sounds like your <br>
ability to move the cube in your mind is far more developed then my own, and <br>
I suspect you have the potential to be an extremely capable blindfold <br>
cubist.<br>

Wow!  Perhaps you should update the unofficial records with this<br>
time! The best one there right now is right at 3 minutes. Now you&#x27;ve<br>
got my interest - do you have the capability of making and uploading<br>
videos?  I&#x27;d love to see a 5x5x5 being solved, period!  But that<br>
fast would be even more amazing.  I have yet to touch a 5x5x5, so<br>
it&#x27;s still a bit surreal to me.<br>
<br>
&gt; Anyway, my 3-cycle move (like a LL permutation so I need to<br>
&gt; preserve orientation etc.) is 72 moves or if I need to do the other<br>
&gt; way 144 moves <br>
Again - wow!  I can give you some algs that I&#x27;ve come up with, if<br>
you&#x27;re interested. I don&#x27;t want to spoil it, though, if you&#x27;re the<br>
type that likes to be able to come up with the solution on your own.<br>
I personally have never been able to do that.  I find other people&#x27;s<br>
solutions on the internet, and then I try to improve from there. The<br>
12 move sequence that I mentioned (along with its inverse, and a<br>
slight modification) can cycle any 3 corners on one face without<br>
disturbing edges at all and without disturbing corner orientation<br>
(i.e. the only affect it has is to cycle 3 corners). I hadn&#x27;t<br>
counted my moves on the megaminx in quite a while, but my whole<br>
solution for the megaminx used to be (and probably still is) between<br>
150 and 200 moves on average (I think it was right around 180). I<br>
just counted one, and it took 193 moves for the whole solution.<br>
<br>
&gt; To do the algorithm 3 times on my megaminx takes about 5 minutes or <br>
&gt; 100 seconds a go - so half the time it takes 200 seconds which is a <br>
&gt; lot longer than it takes to solve the 5x5x5.<br>
Now I understand!  Between long algs and an unlubed minx, I could see<br>
how it takes so much longer than your 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
&gt; My puzzle isn&#x27;t lubricated ... (because the large puzzles seem<br>
&gt; fragile) and I can get less than a move a second out of my<br>
&gt; megaminx. Sometimes it jams a lot so I need to go 4 times round the<br>
&gt; wrong direction instead of once in the right direction.<br>
I don&#x27;t want for you to ruin your minx, but I can say that mine (a 12<br>
color, tiled version from Mefferts) lubed quite nicely with the same<br>
silicon spray I use for my 3x3x3 cube. After lubrication, based on<br>
the move count I mentioned before and my times (usually in the 2:30 -<br>
2:50 range), I can get a little better than 1 move per second. The<br>
only problem I had is that the lube loosened a screw on one of the<br>
centers, so I had to reglue it, and I made it a little tighter than I<br>
would&#x27;ve liked. But, in general I&#x27;d say that my megaminx seems just<br>
as sturdy as my 3x3x3 cube, if not more so, because of its weight.<br>
But, like I said... Don&#x27;t ruin your minx on my account of saying it<br>
will be fine :-P  Oh, and two other side affects - pieces don&#x27;t catch<br>
as easily, but I also didn&#x27;t pop pieces at all until I lubed my<br>
megaminx, if memory serves me correctly.  That&#x27;s probably just<br>
because I hadn&#x27;t used the puzzle enough to loosen it to the point of<br>
popping pieces yet, though.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; Regardless, there are likely several different factors here -<br>
&gt; &gt; practice, method efficiency, and puzzle &quot;movability.&quot;  <br>
&gt; All 3 affect me!<br>
As they do us all - it&#x27;s just a matter of positive or negative<br>
affect :-P<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#x27;m really looking for a low move count method. Delay is not as<br>
&gt; big a deal for me at this point.<br>
That&#x27;s usually the best place to start - get a low move count, and<br>
then see where you can cut corners to reduce delays, possibly adding<br>
some moves to the overall solution.  What method do you use to solve<br>
the megaminx, if you don&#x27;t mind my asking? My approach is basically<br>
star (cross) &amp; F2L from the cube, applied to several faces, working<br>
down to a LL, which I do in order of edge orientation, edge<br>
permutation, corner orientation, and finally corner permutation.<br>
<br>
&gt; I can&#x27;t remember the last time I needed 300 moves to solve the<br>
&gt; 5x5x5.<br>
I wasn&#x27;t completely sure on the move count, here - I just looked at<br>
the oinkleburger applet, saw a few that were around 250-280, and<br>
figured that 250-300 was probably a reasonable range.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt;   In my view the &quot;12 solves&quot; fails this fairness test for at least<br>
&gt; two reasons. One is because there is no standard of measurment for<br>
&gt; isolated tries. It can only be fair if anyone who is tested faces the<br>
&gt; same challenge (not a seemingly similar challenge) and faces *unknown*<br>
&gt; mixes. This problem is partly because there is no way to agree upon a<br>
&gt; &quot;blind&quot; set of mixes that anyone can try at another time. There is no<br>
&gt; way to keep that &quot;blind&quot; set of mixes secret, and if they are not<br>
&gt; secret they can be analysed and practiced.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Much like the thread for the &quot;theoretical fastest average&quot; I suppose  :)<br>
<br>
&gt;  Another reason is that the &quot;12 solves&quot; do not meet the &quot;same<br>
&gt; challenge&quot; requirement is because the number is too small. IMO it&#x27;s<br>
&gt; simple not a large enough random sample. Someone could meet up with<br>
&gt; several mixes that happen to fit well with his or her style.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I understand what you are saying.  Don&#x27;t you think though that even in a<br>
competition scenario, one person might have a time which is considerably<br>
faster than the other contestants, even if he or she is not nearly as good<br>
as the others.<br>
<br>
I was reading a thread some weeks ago about Lars Petrus on a bad day getting<br>
high twenties.  Boy I wish he and I were in competition together on a day<br>
like that.  Head to head, Lars on a bad day, Rob on a good day, Lars gets 28<br>
seconds and Rob gets 27! (one off of course!)  hehe!  Everyone would be<br>
convinced that I am better.  Of course I&#x27;d keep it secret that I average<br>
about 35  :)<br>
<br>
When Minh Thai claimed the world record, it was popular opinion that he beat<br>
people who were thought to be faster.  I guess that on the day, even though<br>
they all solved the same state, his solution worked better for that<br>
particular state.  His record might not have stood if the cube looked a<br>
little different!  It&#x27;s just the nature of the cube.<br>
<br>
Hey, maybe I could make a huge stack of crates (never done it before!) and<br>
beat the pros if they keep getting a freak gust of wind! (or do they do it<br>
indoors now?)<br>
<br>
I think that the only benefit that Jess will get on the day is less pressure<br>
in a more familiar environment perhaps?  He still has to beat the record in<br>
just twelve tries, which is no mean feat.  And it might only be a short<br>
lived record, there is still a good chance that it will be smashed again at<br>
the championships!  Sure, the goal posts will have moved, but it can only<br>
make the competition more exciting!<br>

It&#x27;s there - my real cube is no good for speed cubing on (it jams 
and has similar problems to my megaminx) so I just go on 
oinkleburger. The time there (the one reported on speedcubing.com) 
is 2 minutes 1 second (1.something seconds but I don&#x27;t recall the 
something at the moment). I&#x27;m pretty sure that I can go under 2&#x27;30&quot; 
most of the time.

There&#x27;s special stuff you can do on the 5x5x5 that is possible on 
larger cubes but occurs much less frequently as the layers have to 
be attuned.

Wouldn&#x27;t mind a 3-cycle move - only 8 months to go to the contest 
and I think I&#x27;m going to need 2 or 3 months to get my megaminx to 
the point where I am happy (plus I&#x27;ve got to keep up with the big 
cubes, lest you or Ron overtake me) and write up the details of my 
improved blindfold system and then learn in and practise that too.
Probably I&#x27;ll end up Jack of all trades and not win any event.

In my head I meant from move 11, when it&#x27;s a two full layer position 
of sorts, but I didn&#x27;t write it.

James Dale got 17 moves out of his computer, which I think is very 
low? And confirms that this particular mix is in a favorable mix 
state.

And when I think of it, that is how we can answer if those 25 move 
mixes are really random enough. Run a bunch of them through Cube 
Explorer, and see if they produce a lower average than 35 move ones. 
Heck, if you&#x27;re at it, test all numbers from 20 upwards, and see 
where it flattens out.

Maybe someone&#x27;s already done that?

&gt;oinkleburger.<br>
Ah.  I thought you were talking about a real 5x5x5 puzzles.  I&#x27;ve<br>
found that I can solve the 4x4x4 significantly faster on the applet<br>
than I can on an actual cube - averaging just under 2:00 this month<br>
on the applet and more like 2:35 on the real thing. I can only guess<br>
how much worse my real 5x5x5 will be.<br>
<br>
&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t mind a 3-cycle move - only 8 months to go to the contest <br>
&gt;and I think I&#x27;m going to need 2 or 3 months to get my megaminx to <br>
&gt;the point where I am happy....<br>
Originally, I said the alg and its inverse, however I guess I<br>
actually meant its reflection - I always get those mixed up.  For<br>
these sequences, U and F are adjacent, and L and R are on opposite<br>
sides of U and F, as they would be on a cube. Notation can get tricky<br>
if you try to include other faces, or describe the impact this has<br>
(e.g. What face is D? The one below FL or the one below FR?).<br>
Anyways, try these on a solved megaminx to see their affect:<br>
1) (L&#x27; F&#x27;)    (L U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U) (F L)<br>
2) (L&#x27; F&#x27; F&#x27;) (L U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U) (F F L)<br>
3) (R F)      (R&#x27; U) (L U&#x27;) (R U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (F&#x27; R&#x27;)<br>
4) (R F F)    (R&#x27; U) (L U&#x27;) (R U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (F&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27;)<br>
Note that the only difference between 1 and 2 or between 3 and 4 is<br>
how far F is turned at the beginning and end. 1 and 3 cycle 3<br>
corners that are all next to each other, 2 and 4 cycle 3 corners<br>
where 1 is not attached.  Seeing as there are 5 corners on the LL,<br>
you also should be able to position all corners with at most 2<br>
repetitions, leaving 2 correct after the first, and placing the last<br>
3 the second time.<br>
<br>
&gt;I can&#x27;t remember the last time I needed 300 moves to solve the<br>
&gt;5x5x5.<br>
Btw, I just checked and it was December 5th on the applet :-P  Your<br>
average move counts for the last 4 months have been at or under 267,<br>
though, so I guess 300 is a bit high.<br>

For the period since oinkleburger started recording moves (about 6 <br>
months) it&#x27;s under 264.<br>
Also in that time I&#x27;ve only gone 300+ 12 times (out of 368) of which <br>
4 were in my marathon attempt for 5x5x5&#x27;s in one hour (where I <br>
messed up one cube very badly and at least two others in a smaller <br>
way).<br>
I think without time pressure it would be pretty easy to solve it in <br>
under 300 every time and probably under 280 too.<br>
3 times this month is quite bad. I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit slow <br>
recently. I guess it&#x27;s the Manx weather - it&#x27;s freezing here.<br>

   My best so far on that mix, not using a computer program, is 47.
It&#x27;s fun looking for better solutions. I haven&#x27;t tried to time it yet.

   Yeah I do. It&#x27;s a larger problem.
   I think that at the time Minh Thai set the record time it was a
little slower than his average. I was cutting a few 19&#x27;s at the time
and I know that I was about 5 seconds slower than he was.

   Maybe the best we can settle for is the time that someone can
consistantly beat.

 hehe!  Everyone would be convinced that I am better.  Of course I&#x27;d
keep it secret that I average about 35  :) &lt;

   :)

   What overall algorithm do you use?

   That&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s hard to tell. I wasn&#x27;t that familiar with
others at that time. I thought he would win.

> I guess that on the day, even though they all solved the same state,
his solution worked better for that particular state.  His record
might not have stood if the cube looked a little different! &lt;

   I think I disagree with that. He won because his solution was
open-ended and not a fixed pattern.

   I think that part of what won him the day was his composure. I
remember that at one point he started to go one way and paused because
he spotted something better. Then he just sailed through the last
half. You wouldn&#x27;t happen to know where footage of that is, would you?

I tried this exercize as well.  It was very fun.  I never realized 
how fast I turned the cube.  The first couple of times that I solved 
using the same scramble as everyone else I solved it in 20 then after 
about 5 or 6 times I got down around 14 and decided to do the average 
this is what I got:

12.94, 12.83, 13.11, (12.15), 12.78, 13.91, 13.37, (13.98), 12.94, 
13.18, 12.45 = 13.07 average.

This is how I solved the cube:

Cross:  L F&#x27; U2 Y L&#x27; R2
1st Corner/Edge:  U L&#x27; U L
2nd Corner/Edge:  U2 R2 F R F&#x27;
3rd Corner/Edge:  U Y&#x27; L&#x27; U L U&#x27; Y&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;
4th Corner/Edge:  U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L
Orientation:      F&#x27; U&#x27; F L F&#x27; L&#x27; U L F L&#x27;
Permutation:      X&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; D2 L U&#x27; L&#x27; D2 L2

54 moves not counted the cube rotations.  Wich means that I was 
averaging 4.131 turns per second!

&gt;&gt; remember that at one point he started to go one way and paused because<br>
&gt;&gt; he spotted something better. Then he just sailed through the last<br>

I dug deep and found the WMV file, and with it I found out where I got <br>

          <div class="email-content">well i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one that has thought of this but if it <br>
is possible to solve the scramble with 25 moves or even 29 doing 3-4 <br>
moves per second and with practice maybe actually being able to do 5-<br>
6 moves per second considering you already know what is going on and <br>
it will be one long alg.. you could solve it in as little as 5-6 <br>
seconds... so i guess that would pretty much answer the zen <br>
question.... if i&#x27;m wrong sorry... just thought i would give my <br>

&gt;When Minh Thai claimed the world record, it was popular opinion that he beat<br>
&gt;people who were thought to be faster.  I guess that on the day, even though<br>
&gt;they all solved the same state, his solution worked better for that<br>
&gt;particular state.  His record might not have stood if the cube looked a<br>
&gt;little different!  It&#x27;s just the nature of the cube.<br>
<br>
<br>
I remember that the third cube was in a pretty good position for my <br>
method. And as it turned out I was the fastest of all on that one. So <br>
sure, things like that matter.<br>
<br>
To me a lot of this discussion is about the wrong thing. Measuring a <br>
single solution is just not a good way to measure records in this <br>
sport. Instead of arguing how you can best arrange doing single <br>
solution records, why don&#x27;t we scrap the whole concept, and figure <br>
out how to do a proper record, like the average of 10 out of 12 rule <br>
for the world championships.<br>
<br>
I also think that 10 is on the low side, but why not have a 10 <br>
solution record, and a 25, 100, etc?<br>
<br>
That a book publisher that knows nothing about cubing has decided <br>
that this is how to measure the world record does not make it <br>
&quot;official&quot;, set in stone, or anything that we have to care at all <br>
about. If we define some rules and standards etc, those *will* be the <br>
official records.<br>

Sure, this sounds like a better idea.  How many cubes do you think can be<br>
done before people&#x27;s times suffer from fatigue?  Do you think 100 would be<br>
OK for this?<br>
<br>
I realise that if any single time can be taken for the record, then one day<br>
the record will stand at something unreal, maybe sub 10, and it will not<br>
reflect the average of the record holder.  Averages are a more reliable<br>
measure of performance, but maybe that just has to be counted as a different<br>
(and better) class of world record.<br>

&gt; &gt;You didn&#x27;t mean anything at all better, did you?  Because I have yet<br>
&gt; &gt;to put a scrambled cube state into &quot;Cube Explorer&quot; that it couldn&#x27;t<br>
&gt; &gt;solve in less than 25 moves.  Sure enough, when I gave it this one,<br>
&gt; &gt;Cube Explorer gave me a 20 move solution almost immediately.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In my head I meant from move 11, when it&#x27;s a two full layer position<br>
&gt; of sorts, but I didn&#x27;t write it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; James Dale got 17 moves out of his computer, which I think is very<br>
&gt; low? And confirms that this particular mix is in a favorable mix<br>
&gt; state.<br>
<br>
I just tried out 5 more of Jess Bondes mixers.<br>
Cube explorer got 18,19,19,19,18 moves.<br>
It might find even lower ones but it starts taking too long to search.<br>
I don&#x27;t think its that 25 moves doesn&#x27;t mix the cube enough, I just<br>
think the cube is never more than about 20 moves away from solved.<br>
Try this mixer that I engineered - the cube certainly looks very mixed<br>
ineed, but is only 19 moves from solved :<br>
U&#x27; F2 D&#x27; R U D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; U F&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; D2 R&#x27; L2 U&#x27; D&#x27; L2 B2 (19f)<br>
<br>
I think the problem is that all x-step methods are simplifying the cube so<br>
that your brain can get around a number of discrete phases and when you<br>
are following each step its goal is not a solved cube but a partially solved<br>
cube. Of course you&#x27;d have to be some kind of freak to be able to just look<br>
at a cube and solve it in one 20 move step each time.<br>

centers (on F, B, L, and R), and finally the LL.<br>

There are 43illion possible cube states with a 3x3x3 cube.<br>

required to solve a cube from one of these states is 25.  To date, however, <br>
no cube state has been found that takes more than 25 moves to solve.<br>
<br>
OK here&#x27;s the question: Is there any way of working out the *average* number <br>
of minimum moves required to solve the cube?  In other words, if we were to <br>
calculate the minimum number of moves required for each state, what would <br>
the average be?<br>
<br>
I am asking becuase if we knew this average (let&#x27;s say is is _n_) then we <br>
could say that a cube state that can be &quot;unscrambled&quot; in fewer than _n_ <br>
moves was not scrambled properly, and conversely, a cube that takes more <br>
than _n_ moves to solve is scrambled.<br>
<br>
I guess what would be interesting is a table like this filled in:<br>
% of cube states that can be solved in one move or less: ?<br>
% of cube states that can be solved in two moves or less: ?<br>
% of cube states that can be solved in three moves or less: ?<br>
% of cube states that can be solved in four moves or less: ?<br>
etc.<br>
... the average would be where the 50% line is drawn.<br>
<br>
Is that a big ask?  Has it been done already? If it cannot be done, can <br>
educated approimations be done instead?  Can it be done with a 2x2x2?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, for the 2x2x2, this has been done.  You can see the breakdown <br>
of how many states there are for each # of moves to solve for all <br>
3,674,160 cube states at -&gt; <br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm.  The average (if <br>
I did it right) comes out to 8.76 moves, which is 79.60% of the <br>
maximum number of moves (11).  If we assume the maximum for the 3x3x3 <br>
to be in the range of 20-25 moves, and if we assume the average to <br>
again be about 80% of the maximum (a lot of assumptions, I know), <br>
then the average number of moves required when applying God&#x27;s <br>
algorithm would be somewhere in the range of 16-20 moves.<br>
<br>
As far actually doing the table for a 3x3x3, I think there are too <br>
many states to do this.  I suppose I could be wrong, but with over 43 <br>
quintillion cube states, that would take much too long of a time (at <br>
least years), even with a fast computer. If the average is actually <br>
only 16 or 17, though, you might be able to get at least to that <br>
point relatively quickly.<br>
<br>
Regardless, you would still run into the problem of memory <br>
requirements.  Think of it like this: you have to store the cube <br>
state for each of more than half of the cubes.  With over 21 <br>
quintillion cube states (21,626,001,637,244,928,000 is half of the <br>
total), even if you could store the state in only one byte, you&#x27;d <br>
need 21 million terabytes of storage to represent this.  I don&#x27;t know <br>
of any computers with this kind of ability!  I suppose you could <br>
apply cube rotations for symetric states, reducing the number by a <br>
multiple of 24, but that&#x27;s still quite a bit out of reach.<br>
<br>
Anybody with ideas of how to approach this using educated guesses, <br>
though?  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s our best bet.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The answers to the questions you raised also depend on the counting. <br>
It is easier to find some bounds is you count quarter-moves (by 90 <br>
degrees) as one move and those by 180 degrees as two. It is known <br>
that some highly symmetrical states require at least 24 moves (if I <br>
remember correctly) and because there is an algorithm that has <br>
exactly 24 moves, we pretty much know that the cube group diameter <br>
for quanter-moves (q-moves) is at least 24. I think those symmetrical <br>
positions include superflip (all edges flipped all else in place) and <br>
supertwists (all corners twisted). <br>
<br>
A good place to learn about this is Mike Reid&#x27;s page <br>
http://www.math.umass.edu/~mreid/Rubik/m_symmetric.html and follow <br>
the links to Cube-Lovers mailing list archives. Maybe there is a web <br>
page that summarizes the knowledge regarding the cube group diameter <br>
and related issues.<br>
<br>
I personaly think that for face turns (180 degrees = one move) the <br>
diameter of the cube group is 20. We know (see the page referenced <br>
above) that certain positions require at least 20 moves. If you run <br>
Cube Explorer by generating random positions and then always going <br>
for the optimal solution, you will find out that no position will <br>
require more than 20 face moves. A few years back, when the optimal <br>
solvers appeared, I heard of somebody who just kept his workstation <br>
running continuously trying random positions and finding the optimal <br>
algorithm looking for some answers as to the percentage of positions <br>
with different number of moves. I also remember that he never <br>
encountered a position that required more than 20 face moves.<br>
<br>
However, it is still an open question whether the cube group has <br>
a &quot;tail&quot; in the sense of a few positions very far from the solved <br>
state (farther than 20) that you will not likely generate by random <br>
searches. In my opinion, the farthest positions will be those with a <br>
high degree of symmetry, such as superflip. Based on this gut-<br>
feeling, I would consider the cube diameter for face turns to be 20. <br>
<br>
When it comes to the average number of moves, again, my guess is that <br>
it would be between 18 and 19, maybe closer to 19. This is based on <br>
an anecdotal evidence of running the Cube Explorer a few times <br>
myself. I think that a position that requires 17 indicates that the <br>
cube is most likely not well mixed. But I am not sure at all how <br>
exceptional this is. <br>
<br>
Now, if you make, say 25 random moves from a solved cube, you may not <br>
be mapping the &quot;cube space&quot; densely enough to have a good confidence <br>
that what you obtain is a position that requires on average those 18-<br>
19 moves despite of the fact that the diameter of the cube is 20, <br>
which is less than 25. As you do more and more moves, you will <br>
approach asymptotically the distribution whose average number of <br>
moves would approach those estimated 18-19 moves. It is an important <br>
question to know the number of moves that will produce this, though, <br>
so that we have some idea how many moves are necessary for a fair <br>
mixing.<br>
<br>
Jessica<br>
<br>
&gt; Dr C., (or anyone else!),<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are 43illion possible cube states with a 3x3x3 cube.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As I undertand it, it has not been proved that the maximum number <br>
of moves <br>
&gt; required to solve a cube from one of these states is 25.  To date, <br>
however, <br>
&gt; no cube state has been found that takes more than 25 moves to solve.<br>

&gt; % of cube states that can be solved in four moves or less: ?<br>
&gt; etc.<br>
&gt; ... the average would be where the 50% line is drawn.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Is that a big ask?  Has it been done already? If it cannot be done, <br>

Hello,

My name is James Scott Trimm.  I was introduced to the CUBE in 
while in high school in the 1980&#x27;s.  In a school of about 1,000
students (L.D. Bell High School in Hurst Texas) only four of us 
could solve the cube (Myself, Tommy Moak, Richad Delinski and Jeremy 
&lt;something>)  We used to cube race during lunch every day (I have not 
heard from them in nearly 20 years... any of you guys here?)

>From the cube I found interest in related spacial puzzles.  I am 
currently wrestling with square 1.

I also enjoy three-dimesional chess:

http://www.3dchessfederation.com 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3-d-chess/

Which also involves three-dimesnional thinking.

Not if they told you anything other than the initial state (i.e. if 
they give you updates of what was where it doesn&#x27;t count).

That&#x27;s amazing! I can&#x27;t imagine ever being able to play this word 
though since it&#x27;s a 15 letter word and each player only ever has 7 
letters at a time. It would mean that 8 of the letters would already 
have to be conveniently placed on the board in exactly the right 
place!

It&#x27;s still pretty amazing to even conceive of such a high scoring 
word. I shall email my Scrabble friends about it. They will also be 
amazed. :)

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not being very efficient, and I&#x27;m still spending a lot <br>

be gentle with my 4x4x4 (which slows me down) since I hear that they <br>
are much more fragile than the 3x3x3.<br>

I timed a few solves yesterday and they were all ~9-10 mins. I&#x27;m not <br>

solve a Revenge. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to cut down this time with <br>

   There were running updates, as I had him tell me where specific
cubies were, and I solved it piecemeal. I never had a picture of the
whole cube mixed.
   If there are any official rules of blindfolded cubing, where can I
find them?

There are, but since they include using new cubes fresh out of the <br>
box, scrambled by independent witnesses with stopwatches etc. I&#x27;ve <br>
not done it by the official rules. Basically I&#x27;d say it counts if <br>
the cube is well scrambled, you examine it (you&#x27;re not allowed to <br>
make moves on it or written notes in this period) and then without <br>
looking at it again (e.g. blindfold, eyes closed or dictating the <br>
solution to someone else) you solve it. It should be solved <br>
completely when you next look at it - otherwise it doesn&#x27;t count - <br>
and there shouldn&#x27;t be people telling you that you&#x27;re very close or <br>
anything like that which may assist you in your solution.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The math is pretty simple here, and still after 20 years very daunting.

I don&#x27;t remember the exact number of position, but it&#x27;s around 10 to 
the 18th power. Which is a billion billons (in US terms). So for each 
byte you need to to store the data for each position, you end up with 
a billion gigabytes of disk space. I guess this is possible today, 
but it would cost about a billion dollars, per byte.

How long does performing a billion billion computations take? A good 
number to remember when thinking about things like these, is that a 
year is 31.5 million seconds. So if you go through 1000 positions per 
second, you&#x27;ll need about 30 years in total.

Hm. I started out this wanting to prove how impossible this still is, 
but I guess it&#x27;s not that far out of reach these days. It&#x27;ll still 
need a few more years of Moores law before it can  be done by people 
like us, but if it was a really important military or scientific 
project, it would already be underway.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, group,<br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube art is a way of  using Rubik&#x27;s cube as an art medium, <br>
either to create pieces from multiple cubes or from a single cube. <br>
I &quot;specialize&quot; in multi-cube art, and my pieces, or &quot;things&quot; are <br>
three dimensional (3D) structures. If you have any questions about <br>
the terminology or judicious twiddling, please raise your questions <br>
in this group and I will try to answer them. One of my things, the 3-<br>
color Vasarely design, may be seen in my profile. This and other <br>
designs may also be seen at http://cube.misto.cz. Please visit and be <br>
welcome. :-)<br>
I have a question of my own: do you know of anyone who creates 3D <br>
designs from Rubik&#x27;s cubes? I am unable to find anyone who can do it. <br>
I need a little help from you. I know that there are pople on the web <br>
who construct 2D, picture-like designs. I started those too, many <br>
years ago, but gave them up in favor of 3D designs, which I consider <br>
more challenging. However I did not, in my wildest dreams, imagine <br>
that it would be so hard to find 3D designers. The method is not <br>
*thjat* hard! So if you are doing this or know of anybody who does, <br>
please send me email. Thank you.<br>
Finally, let me apologize for the empy message I sent yesterday. <br>
Computers  are not my strong suit. Ignore that message, or, if <br>
possible, throw it out. I would do this myself, but I don&#x27;t know how!<br>

Looks like we have the memory/time tradeoff that seems to be present at most cs problems. I personally think the best way to solve this would be to compute all positions of depth less than or equal to n ( n = 10 mabye?) and use that as a lookup table when searching for the shortest solutions for the rest of the positions.

Since you have the info available, I think you should post your 
average for all 50 solves.  It would be more accurate than any 
subsection thereof.

My idea was that when solving a position of higher depth (>n) you have to first get to a position of depth n. So solve all positions with depth less than or equal to n. Then save the positions and depth for all with deepth n. You then know that all other positions will have solutions that pass thru one of the ones you have saved. When you have found the shortest path to one of those allready solved states you just look up the solution from that pototion, or you don care about the solution and just save the depth (n) for that pos.

Then ofcourse it is nessesary to sort out what positions are less than or equal to n moves first. Mabye that could be done by applying moves to the solved state.

Thanks for your reply and links, Jessica and others.  The crux of my 
question was can we break down the 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 positions into 
percentages that require moves (and by a move I mean one quarter turn of one 
face).

Working this out by brute force would indeed take a lot of processing, but 
is there perhaps a more elegant method?  We do not need to know what the 
positions are, or how to solve them.  All we need to know are how many there 
are.

We know that the number of positions that can be solved in 0 moves = 1.  But 
take the first line in my desired table:  % of cube states that can be 
solved in one move or less.  Well, there are six faces that can each be 
moved in two different ways, producing 12 cube positions.  Plus the cube 
could be solved, so 12+1=13 positions, which = 3.01^-17%

So that&#x27;s the first line done.

Next: % of cube states that can be solved in two moves or less.

Well, we have 12 positions, each of which can be manipulated in 12 different 
ways.  One of each 12 will return it back to a solved state, so that = 
(12*11)+12+1= 145 = 3.35^-16%

% of cube states that can be solved in three moves or less = 
(132*11)+(12*11)+12+1 = 1597 = 3.69^-15%

Now surely there is some pattern to this?  For example, I notice that the 
sequence:
1, 13, 145, 1597 can also be written as:
(1), (12+1), (12^2+1), (12^3-12^2+1)

Do we really need 256 Crays to this?  I appreciate that things are going to 
get fairly complicated fairly quickly, but perhaps pencil and paper can go 
places that brute force cannot?

Well 145 doesn&#x27;t equal 3.35^-16%. Maybe you want 3.35*10^{-16}% of 
43252003274489900000.
In any event, you are mistaken since some of these positions are the 
same. e.g. R*R=(R&#x27;)*(R&#x27;).
So you&#x27;d have to subtract 6 here.

It looks like you are trying to compute the number of words of 
length less than n in a free group on 6 generators. The cube group 
is not free - it&#x27;s finite and non-trivial.

Certainly one would expect that the median number of moves is far 
easier to obtain than the mean number of moves. There is a problem 
in that the concept median doesn&#x27;t necessarily have an easy 
interpretation with discontinous data.

As Jessica pointed out, the answer will depend on the number of 
generators you use. In one extreme case the mean number of moves 
will be just under 1 (there&#x27;d be 21626001637244950000 generators and 
the mean would be 43252003274489899999/43252003274489900000 moves) 
and the median number of moves would be 1 in a usual sort of 
interpretation. In the 2 generator case (where you only have 2 basic 
moves to solve the cube) the number would probably be quite large.

One would expect that for the usual 6 generator case the median is 
within 2 or 3 of the diameter of the group (i.e. the maximum number 
of moves needed to solve any position).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Simon, Jessica, and others,

   I&#x27;ve had the thought that a place to start would be with all of the
corner positions, and then at least one shortest-route solution for
each. They would essentially be &quot;pointing&quot;, linking, to each other... 
   Then define the edge changes that would accompany those solutions.
   Then define all of the edge changes possible without changing the
corner positions. This last seems to be handled better if slices, are
defined in the same way as, say, the upper and lower layers.

   I have a question. How would you count the &quot;every possible
exclusion&quot; of the following limitation:
   a. you can&#x27;t move only two edges alone, with no other changes;
   b. you can&#x27;t move only two corners, with no other changes;
   c. you can move those two edges and two corners if you move them
together?

After two weeks I fï¿½naly solved my 4*4*4 cube. As soon as I got it in the mail I solved centers and matched all but two edge pairs. Then I couldent figure out how to swap between that last two pairs and dident do much work on it. Then last night before falling asleap I realized that my move ( R u lï¿½uï¿½ R&#x27;) actually don just match up the fu pair but swap pices from the three pairs fu, fd, lb. So this morning I figured out how the swaps where made and worked the cube untill I had three unsolved edge pairs. Currently I solve permutation error by scrambling and resolving, not the best way but it worked this time.<br>

Yeah, congratulations, Jess!  I watched for some time and although the bit<br>
rate for the cameras was a bit low, it was still nice to see what&#x27;s going<br>
on.  It was easy to see when one cube had been solved and another started<br>
already.<br>
<br>
And well done to Morten too, a good joint effort I&#x27;d say!<br>

First I would like to say congratulations.  You have done a fine 
job.  Must have been difficult for sure.  However, your friend 
scrambled the cube?  Did he have scrabling algs to follow? Or did he 
just twist them while you were, getting them semi-random?  This point 
could make a difference I think, as if not scrambled properly, easier 
to solve?  And, if it is true that a new World Record for single 
solve is set... What now?  Kinda disappointing, yet inspiring at the 
same time.
Hopefully more of the latter than the former, but we&#x27;ll see. At any 
rate, way to follow through.  We&#x27;re all proud.  I&#x27;m sure you will 
bring attention to the cube community, which is always a good thing.

-Ross

Maybe you could test this theory on simpler versions of the cube:

- just the corners of the cube (ie. 2x2x2)
- just the edges of the cube
- a cube where opposite sides are the same colour.
- smaller cube groups

He probably didn&#x27;t encounter a position that required only 8 moves (let
alone 0 moves) to solve either, but the symmetry theory does sound
plausible.

Another way is to generate a random arrangement of the pieces, and then
use CubeExplorer to find a move sequence to reach that position.

Hello,

My name is James Scott Trimm.  I was introduced to the CUBE in 
while in high school in the 1980&#x27;s.  In a school of about 1,000
students (L.D. Bell High School in Hurst Texas) only four of us 
could solve the cube (Myself, Tommy Moak, Richad Delinski and Jeremy 
&lt;something>)  We used to cube race during lunch every day (I have not 
heard from them in nearly 20 years... any of you guys here?)

>From the cube I found interest in related spacial puzzles.  I am 
currently wrestling with square 1.

I also enjoy three-dimesional chess:

http://www.3dchessfederation.com 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3-d-chess/

Which also involves three-dimesnional thinking.

James Scott Trimm

I&#x27;m kicking myself (well, not literally of course) that I missed 
this. I had been keen to follow the progress on the webcam.

I&#x27;ve been quite busy recently and haven&#x27;t checked this site for a few 
days (otherwise would&#x27;ve been reminded by all the discussion). As 
soon as I logged on and saw the subjects lines of the discussions I 
remembered -- too late! Oh well.

Sounds like it was pretty exciting. Excellent work Jess.

Jasmine.

  How much time was spent putting one cube down and picking up

  How are his hands today?

Hey chris.  I think it&#x27;s always a good idea to experiment with the 
f2l, as obviously people have many styles.  I think the BEST part of 
your proposal, is that you are going to learn at least 11 of the 41.  
I say this is the best idea, because I think you should eventually 
learn them all!  As for doing it the way you suggest, it would be 
very good practice for those 11, but how many moves would it take?  
Theoretically, to place the last corner edge pair could take 14 turns 
to place, which is quite a bit high for someone trying to get below 
30.  So, I think your best bet is to ultimately learn the 41, and if 
it helps you learn by doing it the way you describe, then by all 
means go for it!  Just make sure you learn from the experience!  
Another point I would make, is that the cases where the corner is on 
top, are mostly VERY easy!  There are 14 cases that can all be solved 
by using the same &quot;idea&quot; shall we say.  You might just find, that 
they appear to be a jumble of algs at first, but later, you will soon 
begin to understand them, and they will no longer be &quot;algs&quot; at all!  
Try an assortment of things, and assess your weakpoints.  If you are 
losing more time on your F2L than on your LL, maybe consider working 
out a good f2l system BEFORE heavy LL practice.  Good luck, and just 
keep at it.  I&#x27;m sure it will soon fall into place.  I trust I will 
see you in the chat this weekend, if you have any other questions!

          <div class="email-content">&gt;Hi Jess,<br>
&gt;Congratulations for solving 2000 cubes in a day!<br>
&gt;How much time was spent putting one cube down and picking up<br>
&gt;another, and did you have to wait sometimes for the next mix?<br>
&gt;Did Morten get anything for mixing that many cubes?<br>
&gt;How are his hands today?<br>
&gt;How would you be better prepared if you were to try again?<br>
&gt;David J<br>
<br>
When I had a succesful solve (non-lucky and non-pop), and the next <br>
cube was already scrambled, I pressed spacebar 3 times to stop the <br>
timer, accept the time and start the next all at once. The countdown <br>
time was 7 seconds (modified version not available for download ;o) <br>
as I didn&#x27;t think 5 seconds would be enough)<br>
I started out with 10 seconds inspection but found myself waiting too <br>
long to get started.<br>
I switched after aprox. 100 cubes.<br>
This turned out to be a wise choice. 2000 x 3 seconds = 1 hour 40 <br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
Morten didn&#x27;t get anything for it except food, hurting wrists and <br>
tired eyes. But he knows I would do the same thing for him.<br>
<br>
I waited for the next mix sometimes but that didn&#x27;t matter. <br>
<br>
If I ever were to do this again I would:<br>
- have more people to scramble, not just 1<br>
- record it all on VHS<br>
<br>
&gt;Jess: I have looked at your stats: what amazing times! Just out of <br>
&gt;interest, when doing your 2000 cubes, do you remember what your <br>
&gt;WORST time <br>
&gt;was?? I mean, did you do one real stinker?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;S.<br>
<br>
After solving 1600-1700 cubes I started to forget how to twist <br>
corners without flipping the edge in f2l. This resulted in some times <br>
around 40 and 50 because I kept on trying.<br>
I only had 1 time above 1 minute when a cube litteraly exploded in my <br>
ands.<br>
<br>
&gt;Jess I&#x27;m definitely impressed! Congratulations on the record man! I <br>
&gt;could never do that, literally my wrist would probably explode :) I <br>
&gt;was wondering something about the 2000 cubes. Did you run into any <br>
&gt;lucky cubes? I assume these were counted because that&#x27;s just a <br>
&gt;property of solving the cube that it might come up lucky once or <br>
&gt;more. It seems like those would be a blessing to run into, <br>
&gt;especially after several hundred full solves. Anyway I was just <br>
&gt;curious and serisouly congrats again!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Chris<br>
<br>
I think I had about 20 lucky cases but in the end I couldn&#x27;t tell if <br>
I was orienting or permuting so I actually didn&#x27;t think about it. I <br>
counted lucky cases as a solved cube of course but I tried to stop <br>
the timer as close to my session average so it wouldn&#x27;t affect it.<br>
In the end it didn&#x27;t matter because my times were pretty bad.<br>
<br>
&gt;Apperently, The new official record isn&#x27;t 22,95 but 16,92 secondes <br>
&gt;for one cube with inspection !!. <br>
&gt;How many try do you execute for obtain this ? <br>
&gt;Do you do this before, during or after your marathon cube ??<br>
&gt;Can anyone do such a record outside cube competition in his own <br>
&gt;country ?? Because I think there is less pressure to beat a record <br>
&gt;at home than in a World competition !!!!!!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;PS: Congratulation for your Marathon cube Jess !!!!!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Nicolas.<br>
<br>
The record of 16.92 is not including inspection.<br>
I did inspect the cube for 10 seconds<br>
The old record was not including inspection either.<br>
Before I started the marathon I solved 12 cubes and the 4th was 16.92<br>
I guess anyone can do this but I would never call up Guinness just to <br>
set one speed record. I did this in relation to the marathon.<br>
I think the pressure was pretty high after all. The 12 cubes just <br>
flew away and I was very very happy to get a good time so early.<br>
<br>
AND NOW FOR THE INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I have uploaded some pictures from the marathon at:<br>

Congratulations! What method do you use? I also just set a new 
record with one hand, and I FINALLY BROKE ONE MINUTE!! Might have 
been slightly lucky, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure. My new record is 57 
seconds. Also I just set a new record for with my feet: 8 minutes 15 
seconds.

Most important is to be able to look at a piece and know what number 
it represents so take some time on a solved cube and think to 
yourself that this particular colour combination goes with this 
number. For instance, on my cubes the edge coloured white-green-red 
is edge 1 and the blue-yellow-red edge is edge 7 etc.

Memorizing the corners (position-wise) amounts to memorizing a 
sequence of 8 numbers (not much longer than a telephone number). For 
the orientation it&#x27;s best to just think of pairs or triples of 
corners that you will orient together.

I tend to be good at just memorizing digits - I once memorized pi to 
830 decimal places without any real sort of memorization technique 
(I&#x27;d use groups of 3 and 4 and sometimes note things like some group 
was a prime or a cube etc.)

Nonetheless, it is possible to associate pairs of numbers with 
things to try to make life easier. I&#x27;ll try and post some 
suggestions in my lunch break.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris.  Under 50 seonds is great!  I&#x27;m also keen to average under 30 <br>
seconds!  Jessica (I think) posted a few months ago that in speedcubing <br>
there&#x27;s no free lunch ... if you want to get your f2l times down then you <br>
will probably want to get those 41 learnt, plus others!  There are lots of <br>
different ways to do the f2l, and what works best for one person might not <br>
be best for someone else, so experiment with different moves and approaches <br>
and try to tailor it to fit your hands and mind.<br>
<br>
But however you do it, learning f2l seems to fall into two parts: there is <br>
the learning of the algorithms themselves, and then there is also learning <br>
to *recognize* the patterns as they come up, improving until you start to <br>
&quot;look ahead&quot;, seeing what to do next while finishing up something else.  <br>
Now, as has been said many times on this forum in many different ways, <br>
learning the actual algorithms (whichever ones you deide to do) for f2l is <br>
not as difficult as the last layer algorithms, becuase (a) a lot of them <br>
fall into one of only a few &quot;groups&quot;, and (b) most of them are short enough, <br>
or direct enough, to see how the algorithm &quot;works&quot;, making memorization <br>
easier.<br>
<br>
For that reason, I think it is the recognition part of the f2l that requires <br>
the most attention.  And that is why my tip would be yes, learn those 11 <br>
ones first as you suggest.  But once learnt try to avoid doing f2l with just <br>
those 11 algorithms and no others for any length of time, because if you do <br>
you may find yourself needing to &quot;re-learn&quot; the recognition part of the f2l, <br>
and the re-learning may take more time then the learning itself.  So I would <br>
suggest that once you have those 11 under your fingers start on the others <br>
as soon as you can.  I promise you, if you just gird those loins, straighten <br>
that back, bite that bullet and stiffen those lips (I&#x27;m getting a slightly <br>
odd picture here ;-)) the 41 algorithms will quickly become about 10 <br>
algorithms plus 30 others that all become one of about four different sorts. <br>
  Getting all 41 down as a chunk will help with the recognition part of your <br>
f2l, plus lay a good foundation for the looking ahead part (which I am still <br>
working on ...  arrgggghh!!).<br>
<br>
Pretty soon after getting those 41 done you will want to start thinking <br>
about using empty slots to cut down your number of moves, like the ones at:<br>
http://www.oinkleburger.com/cube/f2l/<br>
My point above holds with the shortcuts as well: if you train your brain for <br>
too long to see f2l with just the 41 set, you may find that under pressure <br>
(e.g. time pressure) your mind will most annoyingly bring up only those 41, <br>
and no others (does anyone else have that?).<br>
<br>
Anyway, very best with your f2l.  I find practising f2l to be the most fun <br>
part of Jessica&#x27;s method.  It might take a while, but at least I will enjoy <br>
working on it.  Now orienting the last layer in one look ... that&#x27;s pure <br>
slog!<br>
S.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I have been working on learning the f2l basically 41 algs altogether<br>
&gt;i was thinking that if i only learned the 11 algs that has the corner<br>
&gt;in the right place and if i come up with the corner on the top just<br>
&gt;use RUR&#x27; to drop it into place (about a half second finger trick) and<br>
&gt;just apply one of the 11 algs to it would that be reasonable...<br>
&gt;please if you have any input for me let me know...  am i just trying<br>
&gt;to learn to fast or is that a good start to learn maybe i&#x27;ll loss a<br>
&gt;second or 2 but my mind wouldn&#x27;t be jumbled up with algs and that<br>
&gt;will get me working on my probs for the last layer... sorry about the<br>
&gt;babling i&#x27;m just anxious to break 30 seconds now that i got my ave<br>
&gt;under 50...<br>

and i appreciate the feedback that i got but now that i am farther <br>
into it i see that if i only use 11 algs then i am no farther than i <br>
was before cuz i am still taking the extra time to drop the corner <br>
needed into the bottom layer so i am basically still doing a layer by <br>
layer... and with further inspection of the f2l algs they are all <br>
easy to learn cuz there is an alg for each situation that uses my 3 <br>
fav faces F, U, R... which all fit my hands good i am only through <br>
abuot 10 of the 41 but have also found different algs that aren&#x27;t <br>
listed and work better for some situations than the algs that are <br>

You can try to associate pairs of numbers with stuff like the 
Olympics: e.g.

1 2 Stockholm
2 4 Paris
2 8 Amsterdam
3 2 Lake Placid (Winter - summer location conflicts with 84)
3 6 Berlin
4 8 London
5 2 Helsinki
5 6 Melbourne
6 4 Tokyo
6 8 Mexico (City)
7 2 Munich
7 6 Montreal
8 4 Los Angeles
9 2 Barcelona
9 4 Lillehammer
9 6 Atlanta
9 8 Nagano

(You can&#x27;t get the pair 8 8 so no Seoul, unfortunately.)

I only actually knew some of these (looked up the rest).
I&#x27;d probably think more of 36 as being a square.

Dialing codes:

e.g. 2 12 (Manhattan)
4 11 (directory enquiries - US)
6 11 (report phone needing fixing - US)
9 11 (emergency - US)

Health forms

1 11 (E1 11 is the form you get to be covered in Europe on holiday 
from the UK)

Primes

1 3, 1 7, 1 9, 2 3, 2 9, 2 11, 3 1, 3 7, 3 11, 4 1, 4 3, 4 7, 5 3, 
5 9, 6 1, 6 7, 7 1, 7 3, 7 9, 8 3, 8 9, 8 11, 9 7, 9 11, 10 1, 10 3, 
10 7, 10 9, 11 3, 12 7

Squares
1 6, 2 5, 3 6, 4 9, 6 4, 8 1, 12 1

Cubes
2 7, 6 4, 12 5

Alphabet

2 6

Cards

5 2
5 4 (with jokers)
5 6 (if 3 jokers plus bridge scoring card)
2 1 Pontoon/Blackjack

etc.

You could probably make up stuff for everything if you wanted. I 
generally just remember the digits but this method isn&#x27;t suitable 
for everyone.

e.g. to start you off

1 2 Dozen
1 3 Baker(&#x27;s dozen), triskadekaphobia etc.
1 4 Valentine

and so forth.

I didn&#x27;t get any further, but theses systems can be great for speed-<br>

          <div class="email-content">I definitely subscribe to the idea of learning F2L by recognition + 
understanding, rather than blindly learning algorithms. When I first 
cubing, the main aim was just to solve the thing.

Once I had done this, and gotten my time down to about a minute, I 
looked for other things to do with the cube. One was obviously to work 
on improving my times. Another was improving the efficiency of my 
solution so that I could reduce the average number of moves it takes 
to solve the cube (in time, this should lead to an improvement in 
speed). A third thing I&#x27;ve been getting into this year trying to get a 
better understanding of how the cube works. As a result, I no longer 
think of anything in F2L as being done by algs.

Having said all this, my times are still around a minute and have 
gotten a little worse recently. I&#x27;ve been so excited by my new 4x4x4 
and 5x5x5 that I&#x27;ve barely touched my 3x3x3 in weeks.

well the way i solve it is to solve one face then the edges in the 3 
middle layers and the edges and corners on the ll  then the other 
pieces are pretty easy to put on their right faces from the ll... 
it&#x27;s not something to use for speedcubin but  it works to solve it

Solve one of the centres and then the opposite centre. Solve a third

Join up all the edges. If one of the edges needs fixing do that

Hello there!  Good to see you wanting to learn more!   If you want to 
learn the orientations, first and foremost, I&#x27;d say learn the 
advanced 3 look LL.  That is, if you already haven&#x27;t.  If you HAVE 
done this, then look on the internet for a set of algs that seems to 
best fit your hands.  The algs that are the best triggered for your 
hands will be the easiest to remember as time goes on.  Then, there&#x27;s 
no other way around it:  dive in.  Try to learn them in pairs, 2 or 4 
per day.  After a month, you will be done, which is not so bad.  A 
good place to look at at least for a reference, is Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s 
site.  She displays the probability of occurence of each orientation 
alg.  I think you should learn the ones that come up the most 
frequently first, and then work your way down to the less occurring 
ones.  Basically, just bite the bullet, and start.  I don&#x27;t think 
there is any secret to it other than to just get started, and know 
that it will all be over soon.  The one tip that helps you learn, is 
ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS look for fingertricks!  They make moves much 
easier to remember!  Good luck, and get crackin!

          <div class="email-content">I took an average time just now (taking into account the F2L time as <br>
well).  Here is what I came up with.<br>
<br>
22.77 20.35 21.73 21.20 25.43 (26.31) (19.77)  22.30 24.62 25.53 <br>
24.90 26.19 = 23.50<br>
<br>
Since none of these times were lucky cases I looked at the average of <br>
all 12 runs for the F2L and LL and here is what I got,<br>
<br>
F2L<br>
13 10 14 13 15 18 12 13 17 15 16 18 = 14.5<br>
<br>
LL<br>
10 10 8 8 10 8 8 9 8 11 9 8 = 8.91<br>
<br>
so sometimes I get a good F2L and a good LL, sometimes a bad F2L and <br>
good LL, sometimes a good F2L and bad last layer,and sometimes bad <br>
for both.  Anyway where I&#x27;m confused is whether or not it&#x27;s me that&#x27;s <br>
causing my plateau or my cube being 4 1/2 years old.  I&#x27;m going to <br>
get a studio cube and fix it up pretty soon and see once and for all, <br>
but for now I&#x27;m trying to figure this out.  The differences in my <br>
times for the F2L and LL are extremely sporadic so I&#x27;m thinking that <br>
maybe the problem is me.  Also though I&#x27;ve noticed that LL perms and <br>
orientations that I used to be able to do in 2.5 seconds or so every <br>
time are now starting to get caught a lot and even the easy cases <br>
take 4-5 seconds sometimes, so I&#x27;m thinking maybe my cube is partly <br>
to blame.  I made a video of me doing the cube several times, some <br>
were very good times for me, I think I caught an 18 on tape, and I <br>
also got a few bad times at 26&#x27;s and I think a 27 or 28.  I&#x27;m going <br>
to try to get these onto my computer and I was wondering if you guys <br>
could look at them and maybe give me some advice on where exactly I <br>
need to improve.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I get 9 or 10 second (non-lucky) F2L times and sometimes I <br>
get 20&#x27;s, sometimes I get 6 or 7 second (non-lucky) LL times and <br>
sometimes I get 10-12 seconds.  I was just wondering if anyone else <br>
had/has this problem and how you got past it/are working past it.<br>

I&#x27;m sure there are better ways but I don&#x27;t know of them and they may 
not be easier. For instance, it&#x27;s likely that the best way would be 
hard to work out in practise (like the best way to solve the ordinary 
cube is never really the one a person would use).

I&#x27;ve broken 2 minutes with this method (on a java cube) and been sub 
2:20 on very many occasions, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.

going pretty well. I can consistently solve the whole thing except for 
two outer (non-center) edge pieces. I&#x27;ll keep playing for a few days 
amd see if I can work it out, otherwise I may have to resort to asking 
advice for specific algs!

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

I know what you mean. I am getting frustrated at all these people 
rushing past me whilst I am floundering, but then I have hardly cubed 
due to a bad wrist.
I have swapped to a studio cube, and although I mess up a lot when on 
autopilot putting pieces in the wrong slow and with wrong orientation 
(the colour scheme is completely different) I think this will 
ultimately be beneficial.
I was hitting the same problems of taking 5-6 seconds on a 3 second 
ll algorithm, but with this new cube the corners don&#x27;t joggle and I 
not getting so many bad ll times, however my f2l is still erratic 
from 12- 20 which I put down to unfamiliarity with the current colour 
scheme.
Yesterday I did a set of 12 and broke 25 seconds maybe twice and in 
another twenty cubes or so most of them were 27-28 seconds, whilst 
today I did a set:
21,28,20,*,17,25,*,22,19,24,17,22=22.0 average
I reckon the answer must be more practice, a cube that doesn&#x27;t joggle 
and familiarity with the colour scheme.

          <div class="email-content">Chris,<br>
<br>
I looked at your times as you broke them up into the F2L and the LL.<br>
<br>
&gt; F2L<br>
&gt; 13 10 14 13 15 18 12 13 17 15 16 18 = 14.5<br>
<br>
This is a pretty large variability for the F2L. It looks like if <br>
you &quot;see&quot; the corner-edge pairs, you fly and can do it in 10, <br>
however, if you have to search for them, you get an 18. A bad cube <br>
can slow you down quite a bit, in the F2L, btw. I use two-face finger <br>
shortcuts quite a bit in the F2L and if your cube gets stuck all the <br>
times, you will lose a few seconds.<br>
<br>
The same goes for the LL. Based on what you said, it seems that you <br>
could shave off about 2 seconds and do the LL in 7-8 seconds pretty <br>
much consistently.<br>
<br>
Besides the cube itself, the large variance in the F2L tells me that <br>
you still need more practice to get rid of those &quot;outliers&quot; and keep <br>
the F2L in the 10-13 range to get sub-20. My guess is that you have <br>
delays between algorithms. You can tell if you have delays by taping <br>
the sound you make while cubing and then listening to that sound. <br>
Ideally, the F2L should be almost without interruption (one in the <br>
beginning is OK, but three is too many). When I race with Mirek <br>
Goljan, we both can tell exactly when we finish the F2L and how well <br>
we are doing just by the _sound_ we hear. I know if I hear a pretty <br>
much continuous noise from his side that his time will be good and <br>
that I have to do my best to win. On the other hand, if I hear a lot <br>
of quiteness, I can relax because I know his time will be bad.<br>
<br>
If you average F2L in 10-13 and the last layer in 7-8, you will have <br>
a sub-20 average. This certainly seems possible, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Good luck and do not give up! If you feel like giving up, jump onto a <br>
car/bus/train/plane and come to Binghamton. I bet that a day here <br>
with me and Mirek Goljan will help you quite a bit :)<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you!<br>

Jessica<br>
<br>
&gt; LL<br>
&gt; 10 10 8 8 10 8 8 9 8 11 9 8 = 8.91<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; so sometimes I get a good F2L and a good LL, sometimes a bad F2L <br>
and <br>
&gt; good LL, sometimes a good F2L and bad last layer,and sometimes bad <br>
&gt; for both.  Anyway where I&#x27;m confused is whether or not it&#x27;s me <br>
that&#x27;s <br>
&gt; causing my plateau or my cube being 4 1/2 years old.  I&#x27;m going to <br>
&gt; get a studio cube and fix it up pretty soon and see once and for <br>
all, <br>
&gt; but for now I&#x27;m trying to figure this out.  The differences in my <br>
&gt; times for the F2L and LL are extremely sporadic so I&#x27;m thinking <br>
that <br>
&gt; maybe the problem is me.  Also though I&#x27;ve noticed that LL perms <br>
and <br>
&gt; orientations that I used to be able to do in 2.5 seconds or so <br>
every <br>
&gt; time are now starting to get caught a lot and even the easy cases <br>
&gt; take 4-5 seconds sometimes, so I&#x27;m thinking maybe my cube is partly <br>
&gt; to blame.  I made a video of me doing the cube several times, some <br>
&gt; were very good times for me, I think I caught an 18 on tape, and I <br>
&gt; also got a few bad times at 26&#x27;s and I think a 27 or 28.  I&#x27;m going <br>
&gt; to try to get these onto my computer and I was wondering if you <br>
guys <br>
&gt; could look at them and maybe give me some advice on where exactly I <br>
&gt; need to improve.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sometimes I get 9 or 10 second (non-lucky) F2L times and sometimes <br>
I <br>
&gt; get 20&#x27;s, sometimes I get 6 or 7 second (non-lucky) LL times and <br>
&gt; sometimes I get 10-12 seconds.  I was just wondering if anyone else <br>
&gt; had/has this problem and how you got past it/are working past it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">hey.. i recently started using the &quot;popular&quot; ll method... of <br>
orienting the whole bottom layer.. and then permuting it.... at the <br>

permuting doesnt take me that long anyway... and as far as orienting <br>
goes... i just do the alg to make a cross on the bottom... and <br>
sometimes there is more than a cross on the bottom... and i know the <br>
orientation algs for all the possibilities that come after i make the <br>

skip the cross part to make my times faster? or just learn more <br>
permutation algs? because my times are pretty varied... my best time <br>
ever is 43 seconds... but my average time is somewhere under 1:10 i <br>
get lots of 1:06&#x27;s and 1:12&#x27;s and stuff like that and a 1:20 during <br>
horrible cube states.... what should i work on first to speed up my <br>

the same time... and couldnt learn a way that was effecting.... the <br>
way i did it was i rotated the pieces around until that would go <br>

well i&#x27;m not much better than you are i only average about 45-50 
seconds with a pb of 36 but i&#x27;ll tell you what i have been working 
on... i have not worried about my LL as of yet i am learning the F2L 
(inserting corner and edges together) and although i have slowed down 
my pace because of the different stuff i am learning and i&#x27;m only 
half way through learning them (easier than they look)... i still get 
around the same times so when i get the new stuff back up to regular 
speed i think my times are gonna drop a lot.... i would say learn the 
41 F2L algs for the F2L and that is the advice that i have been given 
many times.... and oh yeah i solve my LL by... orienting edges, 
permiating corners, orienting corners, and lastly permiating edges 
and with using only about ten algs i can do LL in about 10-13 
seconds...  hope my babbling helped you at least a little...:)

familiarize your brain with many cases that you haven&#x27;t &quot;warmed back <br>

f2l, (ie special cases, empty slot moves, non-rotation)  it can be <br>

the cube.  Ok, now that was all pretty unoriginal I guess, and you <br>
probably think that doesn&#x27;t help much, and I&#x27;m sorry, but I have <br>
*one* more idea that helped me a lot.  Try to cube as SMOOTHLY and <br>
slowly as you can, with no pauses whatsoever.  I said to myself a <br>
month or so ago:  &quot;I wonder how EASY it is to break 30 seconds?&quot;  and <br>
I sat down and cubed so SLOWLYYYYYYY!!!!!  But it was also without <br>
pauses, because when you go slowly and &#x27;carefully&#x27; I guess, you can <br>
see every single piece moving around in f2l.  I was shocked to find <br>
that not only was I EASILY getting times below 30, but also times <br>
around 22 seconds, this is without rotating either, just going really <br>
slowly.  I guess you could call it sort of cube &quot;zen&quot; because it felt <br>
SOO slow that it was ridiculous! I even showed my friend who cubes, <br>
and during a run where I did a 20 second time going &quot;slowly&quot; he <br>
couldn&#x27;t believe it!  He kept saying: &quot;What are you doing?!?! GO <br>
FASTER!!!!&quot;   Then was shocked to see that I solved it very quickly.  <br>
Likewise, my parents watched me &quot;effortlessly&quot; beat minh thai&#x27;s old <br>
record I have on my computer, and were amazed.  Ron and Jessica have <br>
both talked of this feeling, and I never understood it until I tried <br>
to simply break 30 seconds as easily as I could!  Give it a try, you <br>
might be surprised to see some very good times.  Anyway, just a few <br>
thoughts.  Good luck as always, and don&#x27;t let your brain convince you <br>
that you can&#x27;t beat 22.  I think if YOU are convinced you are <br>
plateaued, then you are!  So think positive!<br>

<br>
well put, indeed! Doesn&#x27;t it feel unreal? I am glad that what Ron <br>
and I have emphasized for a long time - you need to go &quot;slower&quot; to <br>
be faster - starts to make sense. There is one more immensely <br>
important factor why going slower means faster times. When you <br>
say &quot;I am going to break 30 seconds effortlessly, you not only twist <br>
slower, but you become RELAXED. You give up that &quot;competition&quot; mode <br>
in which you are nervous and try to break your neck to do it as fast <br>
as humanly possible. Not only does that cause you to get stuck more <br>
often, you get more pop ups, and you &quot;cramp up&quot;. Yes, you do twist <br>
faster, but you go suboptimal and you lose the concept of what is <br>
going on. This is why faster twisting may give you slower times.<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever noticed a correlation between faster times and <br>
feeling relaxed during cubing? Why do we all (OK, most of us) get <br>
(much) better times when nothing is in stake at home, alone, and why <br>
do we tend to get terrible times in competitions? Because of the <br>
psyche. You want to do so it so faaast and you want it soooo badly <br>
that, guess what?, you screw up ... When you get down to sub 20, <br>
everything starts to matter, including your mental composure.<br>
<br>
Now, having said that, I have to acknowledge that this &quot;go slower&quot; <br>
does not hold for the LL. You really need to pick up the speed <br>
there. The &quot;go slower&quot; tactics holds only for the F2L.<br>
<br>
Good luck everybody and may you find some nice Christmas presents in <br>
the form of good times with the cube &quot;under your tree&quot;.<br>

&gt; Likewise, my parents watched me &quot;effortlessly&quot; beat minh thai&#x27;s <br>
old <br>

have <br>
&gt; both talked of this feeling, and I never understood it until I <br>
tried <br>
&gt; to simply break 30 seconds as easily as I could!  Give it a try, <br>
you <br>
&gt; might be surprised to see some very good times.  Anyway, just a <br>
few <br>
&gt; thoughts.  Good luck as always, and don&#x27;t let your brain convince <br>
you <br>
&gt; that you can&#x27;t beat 22.  I think if YOU are convinced you are <br>
&gt; plateaued, then you are!  So think positive!<br>

Actually, I solved most of the cube in a reasonable time, it&#x27;s mainly 
matching up the last edge triplet which is really getting me stuck. 
Althought I did briefly get stuck early on in the solution when 
forming the last two centres.

I guess I just need more practise. :)

My friend has that puzzle.  It&#x27;s pretty good to fill the time! :)  I 
got 2 puzzles:  The Rubik&#x27;s Cube solution video (just for the fun of 
it ;) ) and a 5x5 cube from rubiks.com.  It feels like a brick it is 
so heavy, and for now, it is very difficult to turn.  I immediately 
scrambled the 5x5 as soon as I got it, and made sure to get no help 
whatsoever in solving it.  30 minutes later, I had solved it.  It 
took some puzzling to adapt my 4x4 techniques to the 5x5, so it 
proved to be a good mental excersise.  I have since solved it 5 more 
times, and only on the SECOND time, did I come across something that 
truly stumped me for a while.  I was pairing up the edges, and had it 
down to where ONE 3 piece edge had an inverted center edge.   It was 
the only wrong edge.  And I kept trying alike sequences over and over 
again in vain, (figuring out much along the way btw)  until finally, 
I had pieced together some moves that eventually corrected the parity 
problem.  The rest of the day was completely smooth sailing, as this 
case never came up again!  It was fun to have a good challenge 
though, and I even used my webcam to make a time-lapse video of me 
solving it.  It feels good.   Anyway, back to the 3x3 I assume... :)

get it inside of the cube.

Don&#x27;t forget how we discussed that come lubes are volatile.  It is <br>
these volatile lubes that cause the cube to become sticky.  There are <br>
volatile and non-volatile silicone based lubes.  It is my guess that <br>
the runny lubes, like the ones that are in aerosols are volatile.  My <br>
silicone lube is not volatile, it is a thick silicone lube.  It&#x27;s is <br>
easy to put in a syringe and squirt into small spaces, which I have <br>
done with some 2x2x2 cubes.  It is lubed and ready to go straight away <br>
with no drying time necessary.<br>

well no one got me any puzzles for christmas cuz my family knew 
nothing about my cubing until christmas day except for my wife.. but 
during my parties i couldn&#x27;t work on my algs because everyone else 
was playing with my cube :(.... but anyway i got enough money for 
christmas for me to place an order for a 4x4x4 2x2x2 a square-1 and 
the solution video (for me and my wife) so i am happy about that... i 
already have a 5x5x5 that i got off of ebay about a year ago the only 
thing i don&#x27;t have or have ordered that i want is a megaminx and i 
don&#x27;t mean a 6 colored megaminx i want a 12 colored one... if anyone 
has suggestions please let me know... :)

I bought myself the xmas mefferts special and am thoroughly impressed <br>

the best compared to rubiks and mefferts, my only complaint is that <br>
they could be a bit bigger, i often end up getting my finngers <br>

access thingy!  Sweet!  Now I can be on a lot more, and no more <br>
sharing with others!  Also, since I am windows 98, that means I will <br>
be in the chat rooms!  Shibby!  By the way, I have gotten about <br>
halfway with blind cubing!  It&#x27;s pretty fun, and not stressful if you <br>
ask me!  Anyways, later!<br>

its alot easier to put the picture on the top of the cube to show 
you the alg.  And pretty much everyone who does F2L on top (or where 
ever) does the last layer on the top of the cube.  Its just alot 
easier to see which alg to use when its on the top of the cube, so 
thats why most everyone does the LL on the top layer.

          <div class="email-content">One word....speed.  Once you learn the algs, like mentioned above, on <br>
the top layer, you then get it to where you can get it done on the <br>
bottom.  The reason for this is that you do not need to waist <br>
precious seconds turning the cube over.  :-D<br>

          <div class="email-content">I recently emailed rubiks.com to see if they would be able to ship <br>
their DIY 3x3x3 cubes with the center caps off so that the spring <br>
tension can be adjusted.  I received a response from Patrick Hess, <br>
stating that this was not possible as they get their cubes fully <br>
assembled from the factory.<br>
<br>
I also asked if they would consider updating their vinyl stickers so <br>
that they would be brighter, like on the studio cubes.<br>
<br>
I also stuck this question in with my email:<br>
<br>
Have you checked out the various video clips from the members of the <br>
speed solving club?  The cubists are amazing, but the cubes look <br>
pretty grim.  Do you think it might be a good Idea for the <br>
participants of the upcoming world championships to be supplied with <br>
new stickers?  It would certainly make your product more appealing <br>
from a marketing standpoint.<br>
<br>
Patrick wrote that they would keep these suggestions in mind.<br>
Hopefully they can supply some stickers.  <br>
<br>
I think it would be too bad if the world&#x27;s best cubists were to <br>
gather in one place, get the worlds best times, with global media <br>
coverage, on ugly cubes.<br>

You got a  good point....  BUT!!!!<br>
The ugly cube is a symbol on how good we are.  It shows that the cube <br>
also has a significant factor besides the beautiful minds twisting <br>
them.  A beat up cube is a symbol of long hours of twisting and is <br>
also like a scrapbook.  (I memorized all permutations algs on this <br>
cube).  <br>
Although....   nothing beats the good ole vinal stickers where you <br>
can be the fastest cuber and solve the cube hundreds of thousands of <br>
times and the stickers are just as bright as when you first got <br>
them.  Thats what we all could use :| <br>

Funny you should  bring this up!  I just got a new cube with 2 sets 
of replacement stickers.  The colors on the new cube are so vibrant, 
that I was disappointed when I got it!  Because I assumed that good 
colors meant paper stickers.  But, thankfully, I was wrong!  I 
couldn&#x27;t convince myself the good stickers were actually not paper, 
until I had my friend show me his new paper sticker cube.  The 
stickers on his cube have less uniform colors.  I mean, they look 
like they are blotchy almost, or glittery.  Meanwhile, mine are 
smooth and shiny, a uniform color.  Also, the replacement sticker 
sets that I got have TRUE colors!  The yellow is ACTUALLY yellow, the 
orange isn&#x27;t brown, and the blue is bright!  Maybe my eyes are 
deceiving me, but whatever vinyl stickers I have now, are certainly 
better (slightly thicker too) than their first attempt at vinyl last 
year.  If anyone else has new cubes/sticker sets, maybe they can 
verify this?

Are the replacement stickers the same colour on BOTH sides?  Or are <br>
they coloured on one side and white on the other.  My guess is that <br>
they are paper if they are white on one side.  PVC if they are coloured <br>
on both sides.<br>

If you ask me, paint is the best, but it sometimes peels too. But 
it&#x27;s really good.

I have been using model paint for quite a while now and I really like 
it.  It takes a while to paint a whole cube (I used four coats of 
each color), but it&#x27;s definitely worth the effort.  I have a good 
looking cube and it takes a long, long time to wear off the paint.  
I&#x27;ve uploaded some pics of it to the photo section.

Ok, I peeled back a replacement sticker, and the bottom is 
*definitely* white.  Something is very strange here... I don&#x27;t

   I got a DIY cube from hessport and I&#x27;m trying nail polish. 
Yesterday I put on a white undercoat, 2 coats; six colors, 4 coats 
each. After that will come a clear protective layer, either 2 or 4 
coats. I roughed up the surface with some sandpaper first. The yellow 
is really nice and bright though it didn&#x27;t go on very evenly. The 
green and chrome (for white) came out pretty smooth. 

   If I can get a scan of it I&#x27;ll post it. I&#x27;ll tell you how well it 
wears in a few weeks.

   I think that next time I&#x27;ll go for spray paint because I think 
that it may be possible to get it really even and smooth.

   For those who are interested, my average is starting to drop below 
a minute.

          <div class="email-content">Typical notation for cube rotations would include x, y, z, x&#x27;, y&#x27;, <br>
and z&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Think of a typical graph - with the origin (where the axes meet) at <br>
the center of the cube, the x axis extends to the right (through the <br>
R face), and the y axis extends upward (through the U face on the <br>
cube).  To add the 3rd dimension, the z axis extends &quot;outward&quot;, <br>
toward yourself (through the F face).  The three cube rotations x, y, <br>
and z rotate the cube in the same direction as a clockwise rotation <br>
around the face that they extend out through.  For example, x means <br>
to rotate the cube in the direction of the move R.  Likewise, y&#x27; <br>
would mean to rotate the cube in the same direction as the move U&#x27;.<br>
<br>
I hope this makes sense and helps to clarify things.<br>

   Yes and no. Depends on how you define &quot;change in tension.&quot; Yes, if 
the cube is assembled; no, if the cube is apart.

   I don&#x27;t know that cube, but, in a typical set up, the turning of 
those screws should only change the distance from the center cubies 
to the center of the cube&#x27;s mechanism. The center cubies should spin 
freely, and the screw shouldn&#x27;t interfere with that. The pressure on 
the other cubies can change with the change in distance from the 
center of the mechanism, and that is the only tension change you 
should feel.

&gt; Cute picture, but is there some significance with the number layout?<br>
&gt; Just curious  :)<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I can see each line adds up to doubles, whatever that&#x27;s called.  1, 2, <br>
4, 8, 16, 32.  I can see each line is symmetrical and I can see that <br>
one diagonal line is all ones, the next goes up in steps of one and <br>
then two and then three etc, which matches the sequence of the first <br>
diagonal...  My brain is ticking...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve put some numbers down to carry on the sequence, but I&#x27;m sure I <br>
don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing.  Maths was never my strong point!  Is the <br>
next line:<br>
<br>
.     1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1         =64<br>
.   1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1       =128<br>
. 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1     =256<br>
<br>
How am I doing?  Have I got the wrong end of the stick?  To summarise, <br>
you take two numbers on a line, add them together and you get the <br>
number that goes between them on the line below, right?  What are these <br>
useful for?  Only as an exercise?<br>

It looks like the coefficients of x^i in (x+y)^n.

So it&#x27;s a sort of primer to doing the binomial theorem. In a more 
general instance n might not be a non-negative integer but it&#x27;s a 
good place to start and easily yields to methods of induction in 
that case.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone.  I have started a new group!  It is called <br>
blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube, and it is for anyone interested in (guess <br>
what?) solving the Rubik&#x27;s cube blindfolded.<br>
<br>
I have started it partly because I want to get better at blindfold solving <br>
the cube (so, self interest ..).  But also, many really useful tips on <br>
blindfold cubing have been posted here at speedsolvingrubikscube, but they <br>
have sort of got lost amongst the many others posts that are more <br>
specifically on speedsolving the usual way.<br>
<br>
I am hoping (naturally enough!) that you real blindfold pros would like to <br>
join the group, and also that people like me, who are learning / keen to <br>
learn blindfold cubing will also join.  Having a dedicated group will I <br>
think be really good in the lead up to the championships next year (or this <br>
year, depending on when you read this), as the pros prepare to compete <br>
against each other!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think blindfold cubing is awesome, and deserves its own forum!!<br>
<br>
So if you want to, go to:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/<br>
... and join up!<br>

i&#x27;m glad you said pascal&#x27;s triangle cuz i knew what it was just 
couldn&#x27;t come up with the name... i remember using that in high 
school but i don&#x27;t remember for what that has been over 10 years ago

          <div class="email-content">To those who wonder about rotations of the Rubik&#x27;s cube:<br>
<br>
There are esse tially two kinds of rotations<br>
a) rotations of faces/layers that will disturb the cube (twiddling), <br>
and b) rotations of cube in your hands, without disturbing it <br>
(pivoting)<br>
<br>
Case a) is what makes the cube what it is, a fascinating puzzle. Case <br>
b) is less known, and is used primarily for visualization purposed in <br>
3D cube art. I imagine speedcubists don&#x27;t use it, because pivoting a <br>
cube in your hands accomplishes nothing and wastes precious seconds. <br>
But I could be wrong. Corrections?<br>
<br>
Assume the origin of coordinates is at the cube&#x27;s center, with three <br>
mutually orthogonal axes.Because the cube&#x27;s faces are parallel to the <br>
xy, yz and xz planes, the axes will be orthogonal to them also. You <br>
will be rotating your faces (case a) or entire cubes (case b) about <br>
those axis. Singmaster noyation applies to the faces. I does not <br>
matter how you define your x, y, z coordinates  as long as you stay <br>
consistent with the definition. <br>
<br>
There are four basic angles of rotations of a face in order for the <br>
cube to stay a cube. They are 90 degrees (pi/2), 180 degrees (pi), <br>
270 degrees (3*pi/2), and 360 degrees (2*pi). The rotations are<br>
1) rotation of a face/layer or cube by any of those angles about the <br>
axis orthogonal to the F/B face, call it x<br>
2) rotation of a face/layer or cube by any of those angles about the <br>
axis orthogonal to the R/L face, call it y<br>
3) rotation of a face/layer or cube by any of those angles about the  <br>
axis orthogonal to the U/D face, call it z.<br>
<br>
That should be clear enough. It&#x27;s just a bit of trivial geometry.<br>
