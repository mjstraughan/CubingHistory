      <strong>5. rubik&#x27;s children</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        About a dozen New York City schools have introduced a child-friendly
        Rubik&#x27;s Cube-based math curriculum devised for students as young as
        8. In addition, New York City&#x27;s Department of Parks and Recreation
        is planning to introduce Rubik&#x27;s Cube solving at its 32
        after-school program sites citywide within the next few weeks. These
        actions are happening under a program conceived around two years ago by
        the company that owns the license to the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, Seven Towns,
        which is based in London. In an attempt to make the cube part of an
        educational curriculum, the company took the relatively cryptic
        problem-solving guides and made them more student-friendly by adding
        colorful illustrations and simplifying the instructions. Scott Mercer,
        the campaign director behind the program, says that 85 to 95 percent of
        children can usually solve the puzzle by following the instructions in
        the guide. About 1,500 of the classroom kits have been sold in the last
        two years, he said. Though it&#x27;s been nearly 30 years since the
        Rubik&#x27;s Cube took the world by storm, it remains a perennial
        favorite, with more than 300 million cubes sold worldwide. (The iconic
        Mondrian-colored cube earned a place as a permanent exhibit in the
        Museum of Modern Art.) Teachers are attracted to the puzzle-solving
        lesson because it helps with geometry, algebra, direction-following,
        memorization and perseverance. But most importantly, teachers say it
        gives students a sense of accomplishment; they often give certificates
        as a reward to students who solve the cube. That sense of confidence is
        noticeable when a student solves the cube in public without a guide and
        wows a nearby adult. &quot;Their whole disposition changes,&quot; Mr.
        Mercer said. &quot;That is the most significant part about the
        program.&quot; The lessons of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube were experienced
        firsthand by the 40 parks employees that were trained on Friday as part
        of the city&#x27;s after-school program. &quot;With the kids, they learn
        life lessons on how to deal with stress and problem-solving, and you can
        definitely see it in the adults,&quot; said Cindy Caruso, who
        coordinates the department&#x27;s after-school programs. &quot;It could
        be pretty frustrating,&quot; said Ms. Caruso, who tried her hand at
        solving the cube. &quot;Some of them would just kind of give up.&quot;
        But then there was a sense of mutual support and cooperation among the
        employees, which helped everyone get through, Ms. Caruso said. Seven
        Towns sells the Rubik&#x27;s Cube classroom kit for $50, which comes
        with 12 cubes, 12 solution guides, a DVD and certificates of
        achievement. Rubik&#x27;s Cubes usually cost $12 to $15 (and even $150
        for a digital version). But for those with a more limited budget, the
        guide, certificates and other material are free at
        www.YouCanDoTheCube.com. In that case, the students have to provide
        their own Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. The New York City schools already using
        the program span private, public, elementary, middle and high schools.
        They include the Town School and Hunter College Elementary School in
        Manhattan; East Flatbush Community Research School, Bushwick Community
        High School, Brownsville Academy High School, Public School 99, Bay
        Ridge Preparatory School, James Madison High School, and Intermediate
        School 187 in Brooklyn; SAR Academy in the Bronx; and Tottenville High
        School in Staten Island. The rubik&#x27;s cube frustration legend

        Well, I know that this post is a little bit off-topic, but I hope that
        among the many Rubik&#x27;s puzzle enthusiasts in this group, there will
        be some who are also interested in other kinds of competitions for the

        Dear Mathletes, It is a pleasure for me to invite you to the 4th Mental
        Calculation World Cup which will be held on 5-7 June at the University
        of Magdeburg, Germany. The event is part of the &quot;Summer of
        Science&quot; festival. Each mental calculator will have to solve tasks
        in different categories (addition of ten 10-digit numbers,
        multiplication, extracting the square root from a 6-digit number,
        calculating the day of the week and surprise tasks). There are several
        prizes for the best participants. There will be two titles - one for the
        &quot;fastest calculator&quot; and another one for the &quot;most
        versatile calculator&quot; (with the best results in the surprise
        tasks). There are also titles for the best calculators for the
        categories addition, multiplication, roots and calendar. All the
        competitions are about mental calculation without any aid. Registrations
        from calculation experts using the Abacus / Soroban are welcome either.
        You can find more information as well as the registration form at
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/events/worldcup/2010/ There is a limit
        of 40 participants; the registration deadline is 1 April 2010. The
        organizer reserves the right to select the participants who qualify. For
        this purpose, previous achievements on mental contests should be
        docunmented. Alternatively, you can send a documentation about your
        mental calculation results achieved with the Memoriad software,
        available at www.recordholders.org/downloads/worldcup/Memoriad_Setup.exe
        (These results MUST be achieved in front of official witnesses like
        maths teachers, mathematicians at a university, or people in a
        comparable position. Please include their confirmation letters!) If you
        are interested in taking part, please register early. This will make the
        organisation easier for us. If you need an invitation letter in order to
        get a visa, please contact us as soon as possible. If there are any
        questions, please contact me at info@recordholders.org. Looking forward
        to see you in Magdeburg, Ralf Laue

        Hi everyone! I&#x27;m a cuber from Germany. I&#x27;m currently not very
        fast at speed cubing because I&#x27;m not using 2-look LL but a
        different method (completely intuitive). However I came up with an idea
        for a new system and wanted to contribute it. So here is a description
        of my current system: 1. cross 2. 3 slots F2L (no algs) 3. solve 5
        remaining edges (no algs) 4. solve 5 remaining corners (commutators)
        With this method I set a personal record of about 40 seconds (F2L too
        slow ;-) and am able to average below 1 minute. And the new method I
        came up with is very similar: 1. cross 2. 3 slots F2L 3. solve remaining
        edges + bottom corner (new step, I don&#x27;t yet know how to do this;
        could also be called &quot;last slot + ELL&quot; 4. CLL I don&#x27;t
        know if there is some eficcient way to do step 3 smooth and fast but I
        think it could be possible to get good times with this system. I
        can&#x27;t tell if CLL is more time consuming than PLL and OLL because I
        can&#x27;t do any of them, but I think the time one saves by combining
        the last slot of F2L with ELL could be worth the effort. At the moment I
        do step 3 of my current system completely intuitive. I think it is quite
        unlikely to get step 3 of the new system done intuitive, but perhaps it
        could be done with short/fast algs (I haven&#x27;t done any research
        yet). Happy Cubing, Klaus

        Well, it seems to me that it is not that hard to do step 3 of my new
        system intuitive, but it is hard to do it fast. And I think even some
        algs won&#x27;t change this. btw: does anyone know a site with a

        For CLL algs, you can try http://erikku.110mb.com/CLL.html (though these
        are 2x2 algs, so it&#x27;s possible some of them might mess up some
        F2L/cross edges if done on a 3x3). For COLL algs (solving corners while
        preserving edge orientation), see
        http://cubewhiz.com/coll.htmlhttp://cubewhiz.com/coll.html - at the
        bottom of this page, there are links to other people&#x27;s COLL pages,

        perhaps it could be done with short/fast algs (I haven&#x27;t done any
        research yet). > >> > >> Happy Cubing, Klaus > >> > > > > > [Non-text

        See the forums at http://www.speedsolving.com/ I am 40 seconds average,
        but I&#x27;ve heard answers to your question many times. In addition to
        &quot;practice, practice, practice&quot;, they suggest using a metronome
        (use Google to find one online) to force yourself to go smoothly and
        carefully with your hands while your eyes and mind plan ahead for the
        next pieces. They also suggest training yourself to do the entire cross
        stage with your eyes closed. It may take a few minutes at first, but
        some cubers can plan the entire cross well within the 15 second
        inspection time, then whip through it without looking just after they
        start the timer. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,
