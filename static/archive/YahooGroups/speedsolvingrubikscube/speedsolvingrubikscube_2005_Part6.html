          <div class="email-content">I have a few of each, and in each case the Studio 4x4x4 is looser 
than a Winning Moves 4x4x4.  However the appearance is identical, 
including the stickers.  So it makes me think they are not made in 
the same place as the Studio 3x3x3.  Maybe they are just assembled 
in a different factory, where the adjustments are made differently, 
hence the different feel.

I have firsthand experience this works wonders, although on a
storebought cube.  I tried it on what was possibly the tightest and
most terrible cube I&#x27;ve ever played with.  Coupled with a lot of
grinding solves, and it&#x27;s now my best speedcube.  Thank you Wal-Mart.  :)

You can probably find them on ebay once in a while but they go for
high prices like $50 or so. Yeah they have solid corners. I have one
and its pretty nice, plus you could adjust the tension. I&#x27;d say buy
one if your planning to speedcube but if your just a casual cubist
then stick with a  25th aniversary since they are cheaper.

I think it still needs to be updated.

          <div class="email-content">hello mr washyourmonkey

i used the petrus method for about a year.  i recently jumped ship to
fridrich (about 3 months ago) and i&#x27;m already doing faster times.

in fairness this could be partly because there are certain aspects of
the petrus method that i never really got the hang off; in particular
colour neutrality.

however, i did achieve a best time of 23.5x and an average
fractionally under 30 albeit not in competition :-(, albeit that&#x27;s not
much quiker than you anyway

here are a couple of things that you might want to consider that
improved my times

1. switch to oll/pll for the last layer.  and find some decent
algorithms that suit you.  the good thing about petrus is that, with
edges flipped correctly on the last layer the burden of oll is vastly
reduced.  a further benefit is that, if you do want to switch methods
in the future, you&#x27;re half way there.  

2. step 4 algorithms.  spend some time with the wonderful cubesolver
(http://www.speedcubing.com/CubeSolver/CubeSolver.html) and learn some
optimal algs for the positions, especially for the last corner-edge
pair.  i used to burn a lot of moves in this stage.

3. find algorithms that suit your style.  i used/misused a few algs
from the petrus site for the last layer that didn&#x27;t really suit my
style.  take advantage of the considerable amount of work that has
been done on the fridrich based solution and learn some nicer algs.

4. find the &#x27;leaks&#x27;.  do some slow solves and note where your method
is inefficient.  then work on these areas using cubesolver/acube.

5. consider joining duncan dicks on his l2l2 quest.  the petrus 2x3x3
is a good starting point for this promising method and i&#x27;ve generated
the algorithms in acube if you&#x27;re interested in taking this on. 
unfortunately i got a bit bogged down in algorithm learning and then
fell for f2l pairs :-)

cheers

Uh, I don&#x27;t yet say it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m just wondering whether it 
works because I do have doubts. I have not tested this myself yet. I 
will do a test next time I assemble a DIY.

Depends on how you define &quot;solid&quot;. They are closed with caps, but they 
are hollow inside.

Only coupled with those grinding solves or did it get better just 
because of the credit cards?

          <div class="email-content">Hey, I&#x27;m based in manchester.

I was going to come to the meetup at Dan house (the last one) but
never made it due to some unforseen circumstances :S....

Unfortunatly I appear to live miles away from all the other UK cubers.
Not to fear, I&#x27;ll sort something out :)

What are your times like these days? (Duncan and Jasmine), I don&#x27;t
really wanna be shown up at my first meetup :P

Duncan - are you using a full L2L(1-4) method? If so, which?

Thanks, Thom.

  the files section is the speedcubing group files section. The html file is there. You have to put the file on the same folder where the rubikplayer.jar is, other way the applets will not load.

I think it still needs to be updated.

And could u post a link to ur files section? I am trying all sorts of
things like /files, /temp but i get the &quot;under construction&quot; page for
the root link

          <div class="email-content">Hi Thom,
Unfortunately we all live miles away from each other!
My best is still 29.xx average although now I&#x27;m using L2L2 full time I&#x27;m 
hoping that will come down.  In the last few days and without too much 
practice my L2L2 average has come down to around 32-33 seconds.  My 29.xx is 
L2L1 and L2L2 is quite a bit more efficient so with a bit more practice I&#x27;m 
expecting better times.
A friend of mine (John White) who used to be a speedcuber 20+ years ago 
lives up near you (liverpool) but he hasn&#x27;t caught onto the revival.  Pity - 
he was faster than me and also held the blindfold world record!

best wishes

Duncan

John White?!?! You mean the first ever blindfold cuber!? Get him cubing :)

I can&#x27;t use any L2Lx stuff, because I&#x27;m a roux cuber, but try and get
paul to use it still, I&#x27;m sure you can convince him :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,

I&#x27;m based in Bristol so sounds like we&#x27;re close...

I like the idea of meeting up at some point since no-one I know is
into it at all so it&#x27;s a lonely process learning it from the web. And
slow, too!

Finding time to do this will be pretty hard  I have to say. I&#x27;m a bit
older than most of the people here and have a young family! Anything&#x27;s
possible I suppose. If it&#x27;s in Gloucestershire it will be easier!

No chance of getting anywhere near Dan no matter how much I practice,
I think but it will be fun trying! My problem is I keep forgetting the
algorithms I never use and my fingers aren&#x27;t as fast as they used to
be. If I could consistently get near 30 I would be more than happy!

Don&#x27;t quite understand what the L2L(1-4) method refers to.. is it
layers or number of times you look or...? Is it Fridrich at all?

Cheers, Matt

          <div class="email-content">Hi Matt,
I&#x27;m also older than most people here and with kids.
I&#x27;m in Stroud though occasionally have jobs in Bristol.
The L2L strategies are my method and can be found on 
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle
Its not a great website I&#x27;m afraid :(

L2L refers to Last 2 Layers as opposed to Fridrich and First 2 Layers.  The 
method avoids or significantly buts down the last layer element of Fridrich 
by doing parts of the last layer while putting in middle layer edges.  Its a 
little more efficient on moves than Fridrich and requires fewer algorithms 
to learn.  However the Fridrich algorithms have been optimised by many 
people for speed of execution and my L2L ones haven&#x27;t.  Still in principle 
its easier to learn and faster.

best wishes

Duncan

Where did 6th and 7th time disappear ??? And also, there is a 3x3x3 
applet regardless which size of cube is chosen, 2x2x2, 3x3x3 or 
4x4x4. And while u are at it, pls add an option for 5x5x5 cube ;-)

Oh, one more thing. The applet should be one of those floating

preferred location.

Hi Duncan,

Does it mean that you now have all the sequences needed for the L2L in
4 steps? On your site, I can&#x27;t see the ones with the unsolved
middle-layer edge not in the last layer.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,
A good point Gilles.  The way things are at the moment there are alternative 
algorithms in step 1 that will kick other middle layer edges down into the 
last layer.  That takes care of all the cases except the one where all the 
middle layer edges start in the middle layer but jumbled.  The reason I 
haven&#x27;t spent time on this is because practically I do L2L2 and use other 
tricks instead of F2l pairs to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen.
Its been a year since I first put up my website though so I am running out 
of excuses!  If the method is ever going to be as practical as other fast 
strategies like your own, Fridrich and Petrus for example I need to upgrade 
the website and make sure it copes with every case.  When I do this I will 
make sure that the most optimal (L2L3) solution goes up too.

Thanks for pointing out my overenthusiasm!

Duncan

Well, the theory says that many more sequences are required. But, for
example, chances for having the 4 middle-layer edges in the
middle-layer when starting step 1 are very low ((1x2x3x4)/(5x6x7x8)). 

But for other steps, figures are much higher (1/15 for step 3, 1/5 for
step 4). I didn&#x27;t know if you had some strategy to reduce the number
of cases, as some people do with Fridrich&#x27;s last pair to reduce the
complexity of the last layer.

Technically, I didn&#x27;t use credit cards.  I opted for plastic buttern
knives instead.  But those came first by about two weeks and made all
the difference in the world.  Two of my sides didn&#x27;t turn as well as
the others, and all six were too tight as it was.  The butter knives
helped loosen it up considerably.  The grinding solves just made it a
little looser, but also helped to wear down the internal corners, so
now it transitions between turns better, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be
matched up as perfectly.

          <div class="email-content">For a while I wanted to know how many sune variant applications I need <br>

<br>
Let&#x27;s say standard sune is (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;). You can invert it, you <br>
can mirror it, and you can do an M&#x27; setup move which simply turns the <br>
first R into r and the last R&#x27; into r&#x27;. So you have 8 sune variants of <br>
7 moves each. Besides this large number of easy variants, I also like <br>
the sune for being a real simple algorithm (for beginners and for <br>
hands :-).<br>
<br>
So I finally wrote a program and got this result:<br>
<br>
1 case needs 0 sunes.<br>
6 cases need 1 sunes.<br>
42 cases need 2 sunes.<br>
9 cases need 3 sunes.<br>
Average number of sunes needed: 2.01724<br>
<br>
Next idea would be to find out how many sunes are needed (max/avg) to <br>
solve the whole LL after corners have been permuted (because sunes <br>
don&#x27;t change the relative corner permutation).<br>

One of these 9 is the OLL case where the corners are correct but all 
four edges need to be flipped. Can you solve that with 3 sune 
variants?

If you don&#x27;t mirror but only invert and/or setup M&#x27;, then this OLL 
case is the only one that needs four sunes, so this is somewhat the 
&quot;hardest case&quot; :-)

Cheers!

Interesting.
Yes, very simple sequences like the Sune, can be powerful. Mixing and
optimizing 2 simple sequences give elegant solutions to complex
last-layer cases, often QTM-optimal (that&#x27;s why I often said I would
choose this approach if I wanted to become a ZB-boy).
Lars Petrus computed solutions for all last-layer cases with oriented
edges, based on 2 simple sequences. He may have the answer to your
question.

Gilles.

Hi Stefan,

COLL never needs more than 2 sunes.

Not that this info helps anything.

Hi David,

yes, I knew that, doesn&#x27;t everybody? :-)
Everybody *should*...

That&#x27;s a method I like for team solving. When it&#x27;s time to orient 
corners, one person simply starts a sune and the other follows it 
blindly. As long as the guy starts correctly, it&#x27;s fine. And it&#x27;s fast 
and everybody knows it...

I also uploaded my program here just in case anybody is interested in 
playing with it:

Okay, since you asked, here are my speedcubing stats. :) My best average
is 26.31s, but my real average is ~30s. My best non-lucky single solve
is 20.68s and my best lucky single solve is 17.16s.

My girlfriend and I definitely hosted a dozen cube lubing party a week
ago at her dorm.  Most of her floormates were involved.

My hands are still slippery. :(

I usually wash my cubies in soapy water and then clean them w/ paper
towels.  Then spray silicone and reassemble.  I know that it&#x27;s
unnecessary, but I probably do this twice a month.  Sometimes once a week.


The whole process is similar to changing the oil in a car. 
New lubricant, for moving mechanical parts.

At the Swedish Cube Day 2005 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/events/swedishcubeday2005.html), the 
orientation of the cube was scrambled (using a dice) in the no-
inspection event. It should be easy to include cube orientation 
scrambling into the official scrambling programme.

I use the Petrus method and average 22-24 seconds with it. I&#x27;ve got
several sub-20 averages and sub-15 times, too... I don&#x27;t know if these
advice help, but let&#x27;s hope so:

1. Practice a lot doing the 2x2x2-box, you should try to do it in less
than 8 moves. I guess I average something like 6 moves, but I&#x27;m not sure.
2. During the inspection time, you should be able to plan out a bit
father than the 2x2x2, at least you should know which 2x2x3 you are
going to build. Also practicing to do the whole 2x2x3-block
blindfolded helps.
3. Don&#x27;t always choose the fastest way to flip the edges in step 3. I,
for example, combine steps 3 and 4a quite often.
4. Learn some algs for the last pair, though this is not necessary.
5. For the LL, I highly recommend using OLL and PLL. At least I find
it better than COLL and PLL.
6. Practice going for fewest moves, you may find useful shortcuts or
other tricks.

          <div class="email-content">I was just playing THPS4 and thought it&#x27;d be fun to apply it to cubing.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s how it works;<br>
<br>
Basically, the aim of the game is to make the other person get all the<br>
letters and be out. The letters are usually HORSE.<br>
<br>
Firstly, You both scramble the same scramble, the person who goes<br>
first sets a time and the next person has to beat it, otherwise they<br>
get a letter. If the second person beats it, they both scramble again<br>
with the same scramble and have to set a faster time then the second<br>
person&#x27;s. This carries on in a similar fashion until someone gets a<br>
letter.<br>
<br>
Then, the person who didn&#x27;t get a letter goes first next time (this<br>
time you use a new scramble). and you carry on in this fashion until<br>
someone becomes a horse :P<br>
<br>
You can play with different words, too. (CUBE :) )<br>

<br>
I was just curious whether anyone here is interestd in reverse<br>
engineering of softwares? I am a little bit into it right now and<br>
wanted to know if there are any fellow cubers out here who are also<br>
interested in this. Dont worry, its not always illegal...only when u<br>
crack commercial softwares is it considered illegal.<br>
<br>
It would be great if a fellow cuber also turns out to be a reverser, i<br>
would love to talk with him/her :)<br>
<br>
Also on other note, how many people here are into hardcore windows<br>
programming? I mean C programming with the api&#x27;s and stuff? I would<br>
like to have a chat with u too if u do some windows programming.<br>

Hi Stefan,

This is how I see them:

Definitions for this page:
CUbe rotations QU = y 
sune: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;
reverse sune: R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;
LH (left handed) sune: L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L
reverse LH sune: L&#x27; U2 L U L&#x27; U L
**
Symetrical  position may be solved as mirror images.

Here are my nicknames for the LL corner orientations and how to apply
sunes.

All Up: All the corners are upright.
No sune needed.

Three Down: Three corners are rotated clockwise or counterclockwise.
Counterclockwise: Upright corner on FL: sune.
CLockwise: Upright corner on BR: reverse sune.

Headlights: Two corners are upright, two are rotated to face the same
direction, like headlights on a car.
Headlights face you: sune QU reverse sune. 
or sune QU2 LH sune.

Sidelights: Two corners are upright, two are rotated to face away from
each other.
many different ways to do this
Upright corners on the right, sune then left handed sune.
or sune QU&#x27; reverse sune.
or 
Upright corners in front: reverse sune QU sune.
or reverse sune QU2 LH reverse sune.

Oddlights:  Two non-adjacent corners are upright, the other two are
rotated.
Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise and Left Front is rotated
clockwise: sune QU2 reverse sune.

Wheels:  All four corners are rotated, two pairs face away from each
other, like wheels on a car.
The car is facing you the &quot;Wheels&quot; facing  left and right: Sune twice.
The car is facing left the &quot;Wheels&quot; facing  front and back: Reverse
sune twice. 

Barrow: All four corners are rotated, two face away from each other
like wheels on the front of a wheel barrow, and two face the same
direction like handles on a wheel barrow. 
The handles are in the back: sune QU sune.  
The handles are to the left: reverse sune LH sune.

Put simply. (Once you know the names of the orientations)

Sunes, done right handed or left handed, forwards or reversed, change
a solved last level into the One Up Three Down orientation. In each
case where two sunes are needed, after the first sune is applied you
are left with the One Up Three Down orientation.

There are 5 orientations needing two sunes - Headlights, Sidelights,
Oddlights, Wheels, and Barrow.

Application of first sune, R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;:

Headlights face you. 

Sidelights:  Upright corners on the right.

Oddlights:  Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise and Left Front is
rotated clockwise.

Wheels: The car is facing you as if the &quot;Wheels&quot; are facing  left and
right.

Barrow: The handles are in the back.  

Cheers,

David J

Hi Bob<br>
<br>
This is Sakura from Fuji TV. <br>
Currently I am producing upcoming segment for our weekly live news<br>
show which will be air on 12/27 (TUE) from Time Warner Center at<br>
Columbus Circle (60th &amp; Columbus Ave). It is going to be our last<br>
episode for 2005 and we are introducing the best of 2005. I learned<br>
that you organize the event which happened this month at the Rutgers<br>
University, and I am wondering if you know some competitors.<br>
To complete our segment, we would like to have some competitors as<br>
professionals of Rubik&#x27;s Cube. <br>
<br>
 We would like to introduce the revival of rubik&#x27;s cube this year,<br>
especially talk about the championship in Florida. We are looking<br>
forward to having a competitor from the world championship also.<br>
<br>
-We need you on 12/27(TUE) from 4pm-6pm<br>
-We would like you to solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube<br>
<br>
It is a very short notice, but please understand that it took us for a<br>
while to reach you. Introducing you will be the highlight of our show,<br>
and we Do hope that your fellows will be able to participate our show.<br>
We will prepare you transportation in the case of strike. We would<br>
like to accommodate as much as possible to make this happen, please<br>
let us know if we can do anything for you. We have a great viewer ship<br>
in Japan and it is going to be a live news show like Good Morning<br>
America. You will be able to watch the channel on channel 63. also.<br>
Please let us know the possibility. Since I am on the deadline, I<br>
appreciate your response. I will try to reach you later today.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. Below, I will<br>
attach the program information.<br>

I have a ridiculously large number of pictures from WC2005 (I know,
long time ago, and I&#x27;m just now posting the pictures...). I might add
some more later, after I get the pictures from the semifinals onto my
computer.

That&#x27;s right, even I knew that ;-)

Now here&#x27;s a new task:

F&#x27; R&#x27; S&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; M F D S R F
is to
L D M&#x27; B l F l&#x27; B&#x27; M D&#x27; L&#x27;

what

F&#x27; R S&#x27; D F&#x27; M F D&#x27; S R&#x27; F
is to
??????????????????????????

In other words, 4-cycle corner/edge pairs again but this time every 
second corner comes from D instead of U. Any 4-cycle of these 
corner/edge pairs is ok. Find a short algorithm, don&#x27;t use computer 
help. I have a hard time with it.

Cheers!

Who needs three? I solved it with 2 sune variants, varied by adding
slice moves.

Nice pictures.. Do you mind if I use the ones with me in it on my 
website?

Nice to hear from you again too, by the way. How are you doing? Have 
you made any improvements with cubing?

I also have quite a lot of pics from the WC that I have to upload 
someday :)... 

Cheers!

Joël.

No, it&#x27;s typed correctly, but lower case letters mean slices. So that
is S&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; U S y&#x27; r U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; r&#x27;

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!

 

The FMC is back for Christmas! This year, similar to last  year, we will
have a special challenge over Christmas. 

 

This year there are a few more events, but the format is the same! You have
to find the shortest solution for each category; you can take part in as
many or as few events as you wish!

The categories are:

 

*	Shortest solution to complete one face 
*	Shortest solution to complete one layer 
(not a middle layer) 
*	Shortest solution to any 1x2x3 block
(a Roux block) 
*	Shortest solution to 2 complete Roux blocks 
(Roux step 2.) 
*	Shortest solution to any 2x2x2 block 
*	Shortest solution to any 2x2x3 block 
*	Shortest solution to the F2L 
*	Shortest solution to solve all edges 
*	Shortest solution to solve all corners 
*	Shortest solution to the whole cube 

 

You have two weeks in which to submit your entries, and the competition
details and the scramble can all be found at my website -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/>  and follow the FMC
link.

 Good Luck everybody, let&#x27;s make this challenge the biggest yet!

 

DanH :)

Hey Joel,

Sure, you can use the pictures. I was planning to email those to you
(eventually) anyway. Also, I just remembered a picture that Bill
Tuscher sent me that you might want. I&#x27;ll post it on my website soon.

As for improvements, my speedsolving average is around 19-20 seconds,
with a best average of 17. I&#x27;ve also started practicing blindfold
cubing. :-)

There are always weird cubes on ebay, and rubikshop.com has 4x3x3s and 
5x3x3s.

I would strongly reccomend the &quot;assembly cube&quot; from rubiks.com, I
would NOT reccomend the one from Mefferts.com.

The problem with this is that you will probably know who will win
every single time.... unless you give a handicap... hmmm.... sounds
fun!... how many &quot;...&#x27;s&quot; can I use in one sentence.... I wonder....
this is boring...im done....

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;m a bit ambivalent about not allowing pops anymore. Popping does 
happen rather often on the larger cubes (at least for me), and yes i 
can see that it&#x27;s possible to force a pop and hence abuse it.

But really i&#x27;d like to comment on changes NOT made. I think honestly 
that the rule saying that a twisted centre on a 5x5x5 cube is a DNF 
is far too strict. Can anyone explain the logic behind that 
rule/interpretation, cause i cannot with my best will see it. I have 
posted about this before. There is no way a twisted centre can be 
abused. It only makes cubing slower, and there is no ambiguity as to 
whether the cube is solved.

I also have a suggestion about putting the scrambled and solved cube 
a minimum distance from the sensors used to start and stop the time. 
This could prevent cheating.

And finally i would like to see that stickers will be allowed for 
fewest moves competitions. Again i cannot see any reasons why not. 
It will be the competitors responsibility to provide own stickers 
and not to overrun on time (as always). The rules could say that 
stickers should be self-adhesive so that no tape will be needed or 
allowed to attach them to the cube.

That&#x27;s my 2 dollars ... lol ...

Merry Christmas EVERYONE :D

<br>
Here&#x27;s something special for Christmas Eve, but no matter what it is <br>
that you and your family celebrate,these are indeed the Holy days <br>
everywhere. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, or <br>
some other, may you and your families enjoy the very best that the <br>
season has to offer!<br>

Signs<br>
(Edgar Albert Guest, 1881-1959)<br>
<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s &quot;be a good boy, Willie,&quot;<br>
And it&#x27;s &quot;run away and play,<br>
For Santa Claus is coming<br>
With his reindeer and his sleigh.&quot;<br>
It&#x27;s &quot;mind what mother tells you,<br>
And it&#x27;s &quot;put away your toys,<br>
For Santa Claus is coming<br>
To the good girls and the boys.&quot;<br>
Ho, Santa Claus is coming, there is Christmas in the air,<br>
And little girls and little boys are good now everywhere.<br>
<br>
World-wide the little fellows<br>
Now are sweetly saying &quot;please,&quot;<br>
And &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;excuse me,<br>
And those little pleasantries<br>
That good children are supposed to<br>
When there&#x27;s company to hear;<br>
And it&#x27;s just as plain as can be<br>
That the Christmas time is near.<br>
Ho, it&#x27;s just as plain as can be that old Santa&#x27;s on his way,<br>
For there are no little children that are really bad to-day.<br>
<br>
And when evening shadows lengthen,<br>
Every little curly head<br>
Now is ready, aye, and willing<br>
To be tucked away in bed;<br>
Not one begs to stay up longer,<br>
Not one even sheds a tear;<br>
Ho, the goodness of the children<br>
Is a sign that Santa&#x27;s near.<br>
It&#x27;s wonderful, the goodness of the little tots to-day,<br>
When they know that good old Santa has begun to pack his sleigh.<br>

Merry Christmas to you all,<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s something special for Christmas Eve, but no matter what it is <br>
that you and your family celebrate,these are indeed the Holy days <br>
everywhere. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, or <br>
some other, may you and your families enjoy the very best that the <br>
season has to offer!<br>
<br>
Signs<br>
(Edgar Albert Guest, 1881-1959)<br>
<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s &quot;be a good boy, Willie,&quot;<br>
And it&#x27;s &quot;run away and play,<br>
For Santa Claus is coming<br>
With his reindeer and his sleigh.&quot;<br>
It&#x27;s &quot;mind what mother tells you,<br>
And it&#x27;s &quot;put away your toys,<br>
For Santa Claus is coming<br>
To the good girls and the boys.&quot;<br>
Ho, Santa Claus is coming, there is Christmas in the air,<br>
And little girls and little boys are good now everywhere.<br>
<br>
World-wide the little fellows<br>
Now are sweetly saying &quot;please,&quot;<br>
And &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;excuse me,<br>
And those little pleasantries<br>
That good children are supposed to<br>
When there&#x27;s company to hear;<br>
And it&#x27;s just as plain as can be<br>
That the Christmas time is near.<br>
Ho, it&#x27;s just as plain as can be that old Santa&#x27;s on his way,<br>
For there are no little children that are really bad to-day.<br>
<br>
And when evening shadows lengthen,<br>
Every little curly head<br>
Now is ready, aye, and willing<br>
To be tucked away in bed;<br>
Not one begs to stay up longer,<br>
Not one even sheds a tear;<br>
Ho, the goodness of the children<br>
Is a sign that Santa&#x27;s near.<br>
It&#x27;s wonderful, the goodness of the little tots to-day,<br>
When they know that good old Santa has begun to pack his sleigh.<br>
<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

I really object to the idea of not allowing POP&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not 100% sure 
of the reasoning behind this rule, but I assume it&#x27;s to prevent 
people from abusing it (ie when you have a bad solve you 
deliberately force a piece). But let&#x27;s be honest, how many of the 
top20 solvers in the world have ever needed to/wanted to commit this 
offence? Maybe I&#x27;m being ridiculously too trusting, but it just 
doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem as far as I can see. I really really 
can&#x27;t see any of the top guys who can already solve in &lt;15 secs 
average being selfish enough to force the cube. And also, not 
allowing a POP could completely ruin a competitors chance of winning 
a title. A genuine POP is not the fault of the competitor at all, 
and yet the new rule would be punishing them, since it completely 
changes the approach to solving the cube. You don&#x27;t want to risk 
anything, especially if your cube is not quite as stable as other 
competitors cubes. SO it also means that if you have a poorer cube 
you are less likely to have a chance of making 5 solves! AND of 
course, after you have POPped once, it&#x27;s very unlikely that you 
could recover it and beat someone who hasn&#x27;t POPped, if you didn&#x27;t 
get the extra solve. I&#x27;m sorry for not putting my case very 
succinctly, but hopefully you can see I feel quite passionately 
about this rule change. I think the reasons for not changing the POP 
rule far outweigh the reason for changing it.

As regards the other rules, especially making all averages out of 5, 
I am fully in favour of :)

Per, Tyson, I am also in favour of allowing stickers in Fewest Moves 
Competitions. Just as speedcubers are allowed to use a variety of 
techniques, (some might use a corners first method, others might use 
Fridrich, and ChrisH might be using ZB), even though those who 
aren&#x27;t using a particular technique might know nothing about it and 
not be able to use it in their solves. So not allowing stickers 
because it gives people an advantage over those who don&#x27;t know how 
to use stickers to their advantage is not a valid reason I think (if 
that is indeed the reason for not allowing stickers, again i 
slightly assumed I think). If competitors would supply their own 
equipment, then I can&#x27;t see any reason for not allowing stickers or 
sticker equivalents.

Thanks for listening,

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I agree with Dan and Per. Why not allowing POPs? Some people prefer flat centers, which gives more chance of poping...but...should they be punished by a personal preference? and if pops are not allowed, competitors will not push very hard on their solves, because they will be afraid of poping and ruining an average...so, we&#x27;ll have slower times...
   
  well, is just what I think...but, I think POPs should be allowed...

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dan,

It&#x27;s not really about people forcing the cube in order to take 
advantage of eliminating a bad solve.  Again, if someone pops in a 
competition, the time would probably be the slowest time of the five 
already anyway.  Therefore, the time does not affect the average.  
Cubers are popping with less frequency these days anyway.

So in order to be affected by the new rule, you have to pop twice.  
That&#x27;s part of the reason why we move to average of 5 for more events.

I actual disagree in that a genuine pop is, as I feel, the fault of the 
competitor.  It results from inaccuracy of the turning.  I see that 
someone could turn the cube really really fast, and if they&#x27;re really 
good, and have good finger accuracy, there&#x27;s no risk of popping at all.

FMC I&#x27;ll have to discuss with later as I&#x27;m about to take off.

You should allow one pop per ten solves. Or something like that. While we are at it. When did you ever consult the cubing community at large about this, or did the board of the WCA decide this on their own?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,

If popping is of no fault of the competitors, then logically one would 
award infinite number of pops no?  On a less serious note, I think the 
elimination of popping will increase the amount of action during a 
competition.  In cup stacking, (darn cups), if you knock over a stack, 
you have to fix it before you can proceed, which means if a cup flies 
off the table, into the audience, bounces of someone&#x27;s head, lands in a 
suitcase, and ends up on a plane to Moldova, you better be ready to run 
through Eastern Europe.

Just imagine the spectacular dives for pieces as Leyan pops (even 
though he never does), the piece flies through the air in the 
auditorium, he leaps off the stage, catches the piece, fixes it in 
midair, and then falls asleep in midair?

A glorious day indeed!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Peter,

It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s &quot;up to the judge&#x27;s discretion&quot; and fortunately,  
we&#x27;ve never had to call people on it.

As for the cubing community at large, we definitely had a discussion  
about this awhile ago when we were proposing changes.  I don&#x27;t remember  
when the discussion took place, but I&#x27;m sure someone can just search  
the archives.  It has been largely stated that in order for a pop to  
affect an average of 5, a 40% pop rate is necessary.  That&#x27;s like, a D-  
minus if you&#x27;re in public school.

And again, they should be punished, because popping is not just a  
result of a malicious attempt to get a better average an eliminate a  
bad solve, but it is also a result of the cuber&#x27;s lack of ability to  
turn the cube accurately.  Accuracy is very much a part of the solving  
practice as lightning quick fingers.

You might want to look at some results and try calculating the  
placement if their pop was not allowed.  I think for the most part, the  
standings remain unchanged.

          <div class="email-content">Haha, I remember that too.  It was certainly most impressive.  Macky 
was trying to do 12 solves without a pop because we thought about 
putting that type of record into the record books.  (We&#x27;ve gotten rid 
of it... it&#x27;s too long!)  Anyway, he went into the competition saying 
that he wasn&#x27;t going to pop at all, and the piece flies out, and we&#x27;re 
all sitting behind the judge&#x27;s table, Mark and I, and we&#x27;re thinking to 
ourselves, what&#x27;s he doing?  Why didn&#x27;t he take the pop?

That was one midair leap short of a glorious day.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

The cheating you&#x27;re worried about, is this from a competitor 
manipulating the cube before starting the timer?  I think the issue is 
generally taken care of if their hands and fingers are flat on the 
timing start sensors.  I do remember a few close cases from various 
competitions such as WC where competitors tried to take as much 
advantage as they could.  What distance do you recommend, and how are 
we to measure it?  Just eyeball it?

As for twisted center, I agree with you that it&#x27;s not an advantage to 
solving the cube, but you see from a logistics stand point, if this is 
to be allowed, we have to torrid question of &quot;how much&quot; can something 
be twisted until it&#x27;s not allowed anymore?

I always feel that a cube needs to be solved and not &quot;almost&quot; solved.  
+2 is an issue that addresses &quot;how much&quot; and it can totally be argued 
that +2 is not necessary for normal solving.  That might be something 
we address in 2007,  but notice the principles of the +2 are less than 
45 degrees, in other words, we&#x27;re leaning towards something become 
completely solved as opposed to almost solved.

What if a center piece is ejected from the cube?

I agree and would like to add:

- It&#x27;s also a result of the cuber&#x27;s lack of ability or willingness to 
prepare/use a non-popping cube. This is not WC 1982, you bring your 
own cube and you turn it yourself. So it&#x27;s 100% your own fault if you 
pop it.

- The *natural* thing is to solve the cube, period. The 
pop-and-you-can-try-again-for-free rule is artificial. So when we take 
it away, the poppers are *not* punished, they&#x27; just *not rewarded 
anymore*.

Cheers!
Stefan

Do you know which part of the rules was applied for that?

And I agree it&#x27;s a bit harsh. If I understand the situation correctly, 
it&#x27;s just a center twisted a bit in place, right? That&#x27;s much less 
unsolved than a twisted layer which is only punished +2.

Is it not allowed? All I can find about it is:

&quot;The competitor can use the following props: paper and pen (both 
supplied by judge), 3 cubes (self supplied). If the competitor uses 
other props, then he will be disqualified.&quot;

So why don&#x27;t you simply take the stickers of one cube and put them as 
markers onto the other cubes? Peeling off stickers is not covered 
anywhere in the rules as far as I see.

Or you could use paper stickers on your cube and use the pen supplied 
by the judge to write marks onto them. If you&#x27;re worried you&#x27;d get 
confused after a while because of too many marks, simply put ten 
stickers on each place instead of just one. I don&#x27;t see a rule against 
that, either.

Cheers!
Stefan

Opposite colour is when you can&#x27;t see an easy cross on your main
colour( we&#x27;ll use red) and you see an easy cross on orange...you turn
the cube so orange is the bottom and solve the cube with orange on
bottom instead of red.  It makes the cross faster...and can help with
always having a good cross...with practice it becomes easy...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m going to have to try some.  I&#x27;ve got 2 of the white build-a-cubes
on the way from Rubik&#x27;s that I&#x27;ll use a set on.  I also ordered a set
of the 4x4 stickers for a 3x3 cube.  My thoughts are that a slightly
smaller sticker will have it&#x27;s edges protected a little better and
last a little longer.  We&#x27;ll see.

Thanks,

my friends and i are planning to attempt to build a cubing robot....<br>
<br>
we were just wondering what motor would be good?<br>
logically, we were thinking that a low rpm, high torque motor would be <br>
preferable, but we aren&#x27;t sure about the numbers (like specific rpm and <br>
torque values)<br>
<br>
also, does anybody happen to have an estimate for how much it will cost <br>
to buy all the supplies necessary to build the most rudimentary cubing <br>
robot? (start out without color recognition....using manual input <br>
instead)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Leyan, I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask how you apply your tiles.  Do you do 
them one by one?  They come in a template that makes it seem like 
you could apply all 16 at once (or 9 at once on the 3x3).  But in 
reality that makes most of the tiles come out crooked.  So I&#x27;ve 
resorted to one by one, centering each tile by hand.  Your 4x4 
looked so perfect I wondered if you had any tips, other than lots of 
patience?

  Suppose you are at a TV show, where you have 3 doors. 1 of the doors has a car, and the other 2 don&#x27;t have anything. So, the show presenter asks you to choose a door. So, you choose, but he doesn&#x27;t open your choosen door. He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a question: do you want to continue with your first choice or change to the other door? <br>

  What do you do?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,
Though I rarely pop, I disagree with not allowing pops. This means
that faster cubers will have to focus more on not poping than they
will on actually speeding. They will be much less likely to get a
record average or time because they are worried about popping. 

Just my opinion. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, lets see. You start with 3 doors, one with a car. The host
cancels out a door giving you 2 doors. That means your guess has a 1/2
chance of being correct. There is no point in changing, its 50-50 no
matter what. (unless the game is rigged where the car moves from one
door to the next :P )

I would stay with my first choice, though it doesnt matter. Its all
personal preferance.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s like saying that Nascar racers should be able to crash so that they
can try to go even faster around the corners. It should DEFINITELY be the
cuber&#x27;s responsibility to keep his/her puzzle together while solving it. The
Rubik&#x27;s Cube does not fall apart by itself...it is the cuber&#x27;s fault.

I agree 100% that pops should count as a solve. I&#x27;m not the best cuber in
the world...or even close, but I haven&#x27;t popped my cube in over 6 months.

          <div class="email-content">ahhh yes, the classic 3 door problem. I&#x27;d change to the other door of
course and double my odds of winning. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I
think there was finally a contestant smart enough to figure this out
and he kept winning and then the show was cancelled.

Here&#x27;s another similar question that&#x27;s been bugging me - how does the
bank calculate its offers on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;?

This is because when you first start, you have a 1/3 chance picking the
correct door. After he has revealed an empty door. Your original choice
still has a probability of 1/3 of being the correct door, the other door,
however, now has a 1/2 probability of being the correct door. So by
switching doors, you have a higher probability of picking the one with the
car!

          <div class="email-content">After you choose a door, the host has to open one.  Two out of the three
times, he has no choice which one to open.  When you pick the door at first,
you have a 1/3 chance of being right.  After he opens a door, if you stay
with the door you first chose, you still have a 1/3 chance, if you switch,
you have a 2/3 chance.  There are three possibilities, considering you
switch doors.
1) you were right at first, and you lose
2) you were wrong at first, and you win
3) you were wrong at first(other door), and you win
Two out of the three possible outcomes, you win

It also might help if you think of 100 doors instead of 3.
You choose one door, you have a 1/100 or 1% chance of being right.  You stay
with that door while the host opens 98 doors, so you are down to 2, the one
you originally chose, and the last one that he hasn&#x27;t open.  Staying with
your first choice, you still have a 1% chance.  But if you switch, you have
a 99% chance.  There is a reason that he hasn&#x27;t yet opened that door.  By
opening the other ones, he&#x27;s giving you a clue about where the car is.

and boy do I hope I&#x27;m right, because rereading that i sound really
arrogant lol (really, I&#x27;m not and I don&#x27;t mean to be) ;-)

Now lets assume that door has gone away. There are only 2 doors, and
you chose one. You still have a 1/2 chnace no matter what the host
does. Opening a door didnt change your chances.

          <div class="email-content">Thats a different relationship..NASCAR racing/Speed cubing. I only say
that because NASCAR racers have to worry about life/death cases
durring crashes. Cubers have to worry about a bad average. 
Anyways,

I know a lot of times that if I speed through stuff with no
conciquences, I tend to do better. (another bad relationship) In video
games, if I am fighting the final boss with out much energy left, I
tend to be much more careful and be sure not to get hurt. If i have
full or extended energy I will just battle and not worry at all about
being hurt. 

Cubing is the same way. If there was a no pop rule, I would go slower
and be sure not to pop(low energy). But if pops were allowed like they
are now and i poped, after that point i would work harder not pop(if I
start to get low on energy). If I don&#x27;t pop, I will feel free and will
not have anything to worry about. I will not have popping on my mind
and I will do better(full or extended energy).

I&#x27;m not sure if my point is clear enough (and the relationship is
probably pretty bad). I just think not allowing pops is a bad idea.

Again, just my opinion. :) This may or may not apply to you.

It depends, is it an extended 3x5? Or is it a fully functional 3x5? If
it is extended, then just solve it as a 3x3. 2 sides are extended, so
it would look wierd. If its not extended, I&#x27;m jealous!! (and I have no
help. Sorry!)

Let us know which it is! Merry Christmas!

          <div class="email-content">What I would suggest, is to get a good speedcube, and test the torque
required to turn it, that&#x27;s what I did for mine at first.  I just grabbed a
ruler, taped it on to a side of my cube, and put weights on the end until it
turned. (since I didn&#x27;t have weights I used 1 ounce bags of tea ;-)  So that
will give you a very rough idea of what it takes to turn the cube.  The next
step, would probably be to find a surplus store with cheap stepper motors,
and try out a couple to see if they can turn the cube.  For my robot, the
stepper motors were $10 a piece, and they can not only turn the cube faces,
but can do so at relatively high speeds.

Purely out of curiosity, what design are you thinking about for your robot?

Hope that helps,
-Evan

          <div class="email-content">Sounds like you&#x27;ve got an extended. Its not much different than a
regular 3x3. Think of the glued edges and corners as normal edges and
corners. All 3x3 algs work on it, because it is a 3x3!  :P

Hope that helps!

          <div class="email-content">I apply them one by one.  I find that it helps to have the cube on the 
table and sit with your head directly above the cube when applying 
stickers.  It&#x27;s easier to center them that way.  Good lighting and 
awesome hand-eye coordination helps, as well.

The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would
become a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3
chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice
doesn&#x27;t change your odds of winning (the host will always be able to
show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which door you
picked), but switching will turn your probabability of winning to 2/3.

If my explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100
doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows
you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it&#x27;s much more obvious that
you should switch, right?

To play devil&#x27;s advocate for fun, I&#x27;ll just ask this:

If he shows you 98 doors, and you&#x27;re down to the final two, isn&#x27;t that
still a 1 out of 2 choice?  The other 98 are no longer a factor.

Haven&#x27;t we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing group?

The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would
become a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3
chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice
doesn&#x27;t change your odds of winning (the host will always be able to
show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which door you
picked), but switching will turn your probabability of winning to 2/3.

If my explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100
doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows
you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it&#x27;s much more obvious that
you should switch, right?

You can solve it using commutators.  At least thats what I do!  I don&#x27;t know 
any clever tricks for the megaminx so, like you, I just use common sense, 
simple algs and commutators.  Its just a little harder to move edges around 
so its harder to keep track during the commutator moves.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I agree with Peter here. Not allowing ANY pop at all will make me 
cube slower/safer on the larger cubes. My DIY 3x3x3 i will never 
have to worry about popping. Allowing ONE pop for many solves is a 
good intermediate solution to the popping. Of course one could still 
abuse the one-pop rule in rounds where single best time will count. 
But even if this &quot;cheat&quot; is possible it&#x27;s still fair. Everyone can 
abuse the rule in the same way. And those who occasionally pop 
unintentionally will feel more relaxed. Also, id like to add the the 
phenomenon of popping cubes is for the most part due to a bad/faulty 
cube of which the cuber has little control. If a cube (say a 5x5x5 
occasionally pops must the cuber now purchase many cubes in order 
find a more stable cube? That&#x27;s pretty expensive. As i said allowing 
ONE pop is a good way to deal with it. Has the one-pop rule caused 
any problems in any competition? Is that why it&#x27;s now gonna be 
removed?

And Stefan, i&#x27;m not quite sure which rule was applied when Masayuki 
Akimoto had a twisted center count as a DNF. Anyway, im against it. 
Likewise, ONE broken center on 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 should be ok cause 
there is no ambiguity whether the puzzle is solved and there is no 
way to benefit from it. My easy philosophy is to have fair and nice 
rules without the burden of overly strict rules :-)

And about stickers, i did ask Ron before the competition if they 
were allowed and he said no. So even if they are explicitly 
forbidden, which i think they are with the &quot;no aid&quot; paragraph i 
think we should either explicitly allow them or forbid them. Of 
course there are tricks to &quot;mark&quot; the cube without extra stickers. 
Like folding corners, removing/tearing stickers or whatever. Also 
for this reason i think using extra stickers ahould be explicitly 
allowed :-)

Cheers!

If you use white as main color, it would mean being able to speedsolve
the cube starting with orange for example (on a BOY color scheme).
BUt the hard part of this is that the edges you have to look for when
you solve the F2L are different.

          <div class="email-content">I think you forget one thing in probabilities : the sum of the
probability of all the cases is equal to one.

First step :
3 doors : one winning (p = 1/3), two loosing (q = 2/3)

Second step :
2 doors : one winning (p = 1/2), one loosing (q = 1/2)

As it is said, you always reach the second step.
I really can&#x27;t see why the other door would then have a probability of
2/3 to be the winning one.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, you can use commutators. Try taking out an edge, moving it to
another place without adjusting it&#x27;s orientation. Then take that edge
you just moved and put it in the first edge&#x27;s place, again keeping
it&#x27;s orientation. Thats the first half of the commutators. (you are
solving in 3 cycles) This methods works. I know because, I use it!
Good luck!

This what I tried to say. The old door or doors are no longer counted
in the probablity. You only have a 1/2 chance when there are 2 doors.
Unless the rest of you know something we don&#x27;t, the host will always
open an open an empty door, and this just deletes the door.

It would be 50/50 if the doors are equal. But they are not! They have 
a different history! You know different things about them!

Keeping your door, you win if and only if your original choice was 
correct. That&#x27;s 1/3.

Changing the door, you win if and only if your original choice was 
wrong. That&#x27;s 2/3.

          <div class="email-content">This is absolutely correct Stefan.

Another way to think about it that some people find easier:  Suppose the 
host doesn&#x27;t open a door but simply gives you the chance to switch from your 
original choice of one door to opening the other two doors. (This is in 
effect what the host is doing).  Clearly you would switch from choosing one 
door to choosing two!

There is an exact equivalence - the fact that the host shows you that one of 
the two doors you are switching to is empty is irrelevant.

Depends on what you mean with &quot;he crosses off one door&quot;.

Can he cross the door you choose?
Does he choose the door randomly?
Do you get to see what&#x27;s behind the door he crosses?

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, most of you are right. The chance of winning is 2/3 if you switch the door. It looks strange at first, but it&#x27;s not. See:
   
  On your firts choice, you have 1/3 of chance of winning, and 2/3 of losing. The host *just* can open an empty door. So, suppose you choose door A or 1. Each door has 1/3 of chance of containing the prize. So, your door has 1/3, and the other 2, together, have 2/3 of chance. So, if the host opens an empty door, the 2/3 probability is now on the other door (the one you didn&#x27;t choose.) So, you&#x27;ll win more times if you switch the door. Pay atention, you will *NOT ALWAYS WIN*. You&#x27;ll just win more times than if you continue with your first choice.

Pops will still be allowed, just not rewarded anymore.

Probably better analogy than Nascar: 100 meter hurdles. If you 
fall/stumble crashing into a hurdle because you were too sloppy (e.g. 
trying to jump more forwards than upwards) then you don&#x27;t get a 
replacement run. And why should you?

          <div class="email-content">Is &quot;choice&quot; = &quot;possibility&quot;?

If he tells me my door has the 1 and the other door has the 999, then 
of course I switch and am guaranteed 999 (modulo his trustworthyness :
-).

But what if my door doesn&#x27;t have the 1? Does he change things behind 
the doors?

Let me try to write the riddle how I think it&#x27;s meant:

There are three doors which hide 0/1/999 coins respectively. You 
choose one. The host opens another, it has 0 or 1 coins. You choose 
among the two closed doors and get what&#x27;s behind it. Should you stay 
or switch?

Is that it? If it is, then it&#x27;s the same as the original question and 
you should switch. I&#x27;ve once read one ore two follow-up riddles to the 
original question and they differed slightly and still had 
surprisingly different answers. So maybe I guessed your riddle wrong. 
I don&#x27;t see why your teacher would give you the same riddle as the 
original one and just make it unnecessarily complicated.

          <div class="email-content">Not exactly. He will be able to show you 98 doors with nothing behind
them no matter which you picked initially, but his choice of the 98
doors depends on which one you picked.

Now, if the host starts the game by randomly eliminating 98 doors that
don&#x27;t have the prize and asking you to pick one of the two remaining
ones, then yes, it is a 1/2 chance.

However, as the game stands, you pick a door first. If you stay with
your original choice, you will only win if you picked the winning door
to begin with (a 1/100 chance).

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I know believe that Switching is the strategy.

Here is the reason :

1. You choose one door (p = 1/3)
2. An empty door is opened.
And here is the interesting fact :
If you don&#x27;t switch : the fact that the other door is opened doesn&#x27;t
change any thing and you still a p = 1/3.
Now, if you switch : there are 2 cases :
- If the car is indeed behind your door, the fact that the other is
opened doesn&#x27;t change anything and you still have a p = 1/3
- If the car is not behind your door, this means that the other door
was opened because
there was no other possibility to open an empty door. So this means
the p now equals 2/3.

This is not very clear yet in my head, but I believe that Switching is
the dominant strategy.

Why do you still have a 1/3 chance of getting the prize? You have 2
doors left, one with a prize. The third door had nothing behind it,
and should just be ignored. Maybe a picture might help?

Door1  Door2  Door3

You pick door2
Host opens door1
Door1 is empty

[door1]  Door2  Door3
You now have 2 doors to pick from: Door2(your first choice) or door3
This means your first choice has a 1/2 chance of being correct. 

Why does the first door still count in the chances?

When you picked your initial door, the door that got removed later was 
still there.

Please just play it with someone in your family. Play it 10 times with 
the &quot;switching strategy&quot;, then 10 times with the &quot;keeping strategy&quot;. 
And let us know the results.

Cheers!

You have not done the 20 experiment games I suggested, have you? Let 
me also suggest you play the host while another family member playing 
the player. And make sure you do 10 times one strategy and then 10 
times the other strategy. I bet you&#x27;ll notice something.

I just saw a hilarious variant: Suppose you are playing a seven door 
version of the game. You choose three doors. Monty now opens three of 
the remaining doors to show you that there is no prize behind it. He 
then says, &quot;Would you like to stick with the three doors you have 
chosen, or would you prefer to swap them for the one other door I have 
not opened?&quot; What do you do?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Sorry, that analogy does not hold water ;-) It is actually LEGAL to 
tip over all the hurdles and get a valid time, as long as u follow 
the lane from start to finish :D (And if not creeping under all of 
them ...) I will still say that most pops are not the fault of the 
cuber, or at least not in a predictable way. That&#x27;s the real 
difference. If u tip over a hurdle it&#x27;s the fault of the runner, and 
the runner knows exactly why he tipped the hurdle over.

Sorry, but i feel strongly about this. I can live with the new rule, 
but i strongly disagree with the reasons for not allowing a single 
pop anymore. I haven&#x27;t seen convincing theoretical or practical 
reasons :-)

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Per. There really isn&#x27;t any reason to dis-allow ALL pops.
Well, there is one, but it really doesn&#x27;t mean anything. The only
reason i have heard is that people will abuse it. They will purposely
pop because they are having a bad time. The new rule is to make people
not do this. The thing is, I have never met a cuber that I would think
would do this. All of the cubers I have met are always nice and
friendly. All of them would accept a bad time, even if it means a bad
average. I am sure that a cuber could get ovwer it. Isn&#x27;t that the
point of doing this? To try to get better? Even if it means going to
several competitions or doing 100 cubes in a row, I would live with
the pop and do my best to get better.

The makers of this new rule should get out more to see this! :) I
really think a better reason for this rule is needed before it
actually goes into effect.

would you please accept that nobody says it will be illegal to pop? It 
will be completely legal! I don&#x27;t know what you want. Just like it is 
legal to tip over all hurdles and continue and get a valid time, you 
can pop and continue and get a valid time. Where&#x27;s the problem? I 
think it&#x27;s a pretty much perfect analogy.

And if pops aren&#x27;t the fault of the cuber, who&#x27;s fault are they? 
God&#x27;s? Cause it&#x27;s not the organizers, it&#x27;s not the judges, it&#x27;s not 
the other competitors, it&#x27;s not the spectators. It&#x27;s *you* who pops 
with *your* cube. Why is it not *your* fault?

That&#x27;s right, and that&#x27;s why nobody is doing it. Where do you guys get 
the idea from that pops will not be allowed?

Uh, just a little more cause I saw those nice two words. How about 
ethical reasons? You make a mistake, you fix it. It&#x27;s that easy.

Imagine I screw up the OLL and say &quot;Oh boy I screwed up, can I please 
get a free replacement solve for this?&quot;. What would you say? You&#x27;d 
laugh at me and tell me to continue the solve.

You might get a free replacement attempt for screwing up something in 
kindergarten, just so you don&#x27;t start crying and ruin the day for the 
other kids. But we&#x27;re not in kindergarten.

Tyson/Ron, please clarify:

This means I can still pop but I must fix it and continue to get a 
valid time, right?

I just read your text again and also the thread in the WCA forum and I 
must admit that it&#x27;s not 100% clear. It&#x27;s possible to understand it as 
POP=DNF (with no replacement solve).

Actually I have asked this in the WCA forum thread before but didn&#x27;t 
get an answer. Please clarify what is meant.

And for the people who&#x27;re interested but haven&#x27;t seen the WCA forum 
thread yet, here it is:

... and no opportunity to fix it and continue (i.e. with POP=DNF I

          <div class="email-content">After much thinking, I finally understand, the chances are better to
switch doors. 

Yoi have a 2/3 chance of not picking the car as your first choice.
Lets assume you don&#x27;t pick the car, you pick an empty door. The host
only has 1 choice of doors to open. Now since you picked an empty
door, you would want to change! Now since you had a 2/3 chance of
being wrong at first, 2/3 times you would want to change.

Now if you did pick the car, the host would have 2 choices of doors,
and you would lose if you switched. But getting the car first shot is
1/3 chance, not much compared to 2/3 of being wrong. This shows the
chances are better to switch.

I hope this clears up other people&#x27;s confusion (it sure helped me!)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

But it is legal to pop, and still finish with a valid time.

If popping is not the fault of the cuber, then why do some people pop 
frequently, and others do not?  What causes the popping that is not 
controlled by the cuber?

Accuracy in physical execution is mandated by our sport... just like 
everything else.  Cup stacking, playing music, etc.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Peter,

When I solve, I don&#x27;t ever consider going slower to avoid pops.  I very 
rarely pop, because I&#x27;ve spent lots of time getting used to the cube 
and learning how to make turns accurately.

If I were in a competition, and I popped, and I recorded a 40 second 
time in an average of five, I would need to make a choice.  Do I want 
to try and set a fast average, and risk popping and essentially 
destroying my rank, or do I want to cube conservatively and try to 
place high in the competition.

These are choices everyone has to make.  The only difference now is 
that you aren&#x27;t awarded a solve for something that was your fault.  I 
really need you people to explain to my why pops are not the fault of 
the cuber, especially when I&#x27;ve spent time practicing to avoid pops.

This was all outlined to me one fateful afternoon last year when I was 
cubing and jamming everywhere, and then Macky walks into my room, and 
makes a ridiculous number of moves in a ridiculously small amount of 
time and told me I needed to work on my accuracy.  I learned that day 
that my cube didn&#x27;t suck, I did.

Frank Chang&#x27;s cube is ludicrously loose.  I&#x27;ve popped it while 
scrambling very slowly... but Frank doesn&#x27;t pop.  It was the same cube, 
but he didn&#x27;t pop because he&#x27;s practiced on that cube and so he can 
control it.

Equipment failure is when something doesn&#x27;t work the way it&#x27;s supposed 
to.  Pops have always been a part of solving.  The cube is designed so 
that it can come apart... not while solving, and so when you solve, you 
shouldn&#x27;t be taking the cube apart.

What we do mean is that if you pop, you simply put the cube back 
together and continue solving.  When I first wrote the rules, it said, 
&quot;may solve the cube by any means necessary.&quot;  This was done to imply 
that if a competitor popped and wanted to fix the cube and continue, 
this was allowed.  Popping intentionally to move pieces around when 
it&#x27;s not necessary is not allowed, and is against the spirit of the 
rules, and perhaps needs to be outlined more literally.

If you pop, you may fix your cube and continue.  You could give up, but 
you could give up on any solve.

What happens in the case something breaks in the puzzle? Lets say the
corner connector snaps off or an entire center comes off. Can we
roughly put the broken parts back in, try with much difficulty to
solve the puzzle, then count it as a solve? Or can we make it a puzzle
defect? And will puzzle defects be dealt with differently?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Peter,

If you break a puzzle, then you get an extra solve.  That&#x27;s actually a 
puzzle defect.  Naturally, you can&#x27;t break the puzzle on purpose, but 
of course, this is impossible to prove and I think we&#x27;d get a good kick 
out of the guy breaking his cube over and over again.

In badminton, a friend of mine was playing a doubles games.  You are 
not allowed to drink water unless the court judge allows you to step 
off the court.  You are not allowed to step off the court, unless the 
official allows it—but you are allowed to step off the court if you 
break equipment, such as your racket.  The opponent broke his racket 
twice, and took drinks of water as he stopped off to get another one.

I mean, the rule can be abused, but it&#x27;s bad form, and I&#x27;m confident it 
won&#x27;t need to be enforced.

          <div class="email-content">So I guess we can break down the no-pop rule as cubers not being used
to their cubes? This rule will make cubers be more prepared to cube,
or else they will pop and pay the price (a bad time)

This rule is making competition standards just a little bit stiffer.
People have to be prepared for their cube. 

One quick question: Lets say my puzzle breaks. I don&#x27;t have another
cube with me, so I ask my friend to borrow his. I am not used to his
puzzle, and I pop. I know this would be a little bit tough for the
judges to trace out, but this is a case where the no-pop rule is not
fair.

I completely agree.  I have popped only a handful of times in my whole
cubing career because I work hard not to.  It really doesn&#x27;t take that
much effort.

However, I&#x27;ve noticed that often, on larger cubes, it&#x27;s impossible not
to pop.  My 4x4 routinely pops minorly for no reason at all during
inner slice turns.  This happens to me on various cubes, all different
degrees of looseness.  I have one 4x4 that I can&#x27;t pop on purpose, but
only because it&#x27;s stiff enough I can only do inner slice turns as
wrist turns, which is pretty impossible for speedcubing with my method.

My 5x5 experiences are similar.  I&#x27;ve never popped a piece, but I&#x27;ve
broken and turned center corners, even while solving slowly, on
opposite sides of the cube that it was impossible to see until I
turned the cube completely around.

I&#x27;m not asking for pops to be allowed, I&#x27;m just curious if there is
any possible compromise in the rules to allow more effective cubing,
taking into account twisted or broken pieces that are not done
knowingly, or with any possible helpful effects.

Well, seeing as I bought my two best from you...

And I think it may be a fundamental Rubik&#x27;s big cube design flaw. 
Many of these pops come when I&#x27;m scrambling, or otherwise turning very
slowly.  One cube isn&#x27;t even loose or lubed, and it still pops.

The 5x5&#x27;s are even worse.  Center corners twist and break like crazy.
 I really need to sand mine down.  Hopefully that will fix things.

Have you tried y R (L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;) L&#x27; U&#x27;(R&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;)(RU&#x27;R&#x27;) ?

You can get that one down to ~2 seconds pretty well.

That doesn&#x27;t mean your 4x4 or 5x5&#x27;s have never popped.  I seem to
recall a pretty spectacular explosion in Chicago...

That&#x27;s because not all cubes are equal. And also different cubing 
styles. But noone willingly adopts a style where popping is 
frequent. Well, except that generally higher speed causes more 
popping, and speed is what we want. That&#x27;s why we compete :-)

  After much thinking, I finally understand, the chances are better to

Yoi have a 2/3 chance of not picking the car as your first choice.
Lets assume you don&#x27;t pick the car, you pick an empty door. The host
only has 1 choice of doors to open. Now since you picked an empty
door, you would want to change! Now since you had a 2/3 chance of
being wrong at first, 2/3 times you would want to change.

Now if you did pick the car, the host would have 2 choices of doors,
and you would lose if you switched. But getting the car first shot is
1/3 chance, not much compared to 2/3 of being wrong. This shows the
chances are better to switch.

I hope this clears up other people&#x27;s confusion (it sure helped me!)

You have to turn two layers 45 degrees and pull the edge off. But you
have to pull the center-edge too ;-)

Thanks for the algs. I also hate this COLL case, so I never used 
COLL (but a normal OLL) if I get this.

Do you (or somebody else) also have good algs for the following 
terrible COLL cases (do their inverses to setup): 
1. F&#x27; L2 F&#x27; R2 F L2 F&#x27; R2 F2
2. R B&#x27; R&#x27; B U2 R2 F&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; F2 R2
3. R&#x27; U&#x27; R F R2 D&#x27; R U R&#x27; D R2 U&#x27; F&#x27;
4. F R2 U&#x27; R2 U R2 U F&#x27; y R U2 R&#x27;

Cases 3. and 4. are not so terrible, but maybe that somebody have 
better algs? Cases 1. and 2. on the other hand are very terrible for 
me.

Thanks.  I just tried it, but seems it doesn&#x27;t work too. :(  It&#x27;s a
rubiks.com.  Does it make any sence?

Are you sure you try to pull the pieces like on this picture ?

          <div class="email-content">Hey people<br>
   <br>
  I was doing an average...and got a good scramble<br>
  I was going very well, it was a fast solve...but...when I put the cube down to stop the time, 3 pieces flew away!<br>
  Man, I hate this stupid flat centers on my white DIY cube...<br>
   <br>
  Btw, the time was 15.14...it&#x27;d be my PB, but...<br>
   <br>
  the scramble was: F2 B2 D&#x27; L2 U&#x27; D2 F U2 L F&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; U2 L F&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; U2 L F D2 L. <br>
   <br>
  My solution was 51 moves:<br>
  Cross: L&#x27; D R F&#x27; R&#x27; F2<br>
  2st pair: y2 L&#x27; U2 L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L<br>
  3rd pair: y U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; <br>
  4th pair: y2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; U L<br>
  Then I had a good OLL, with 4 corners to orient, 2 facing F and 2 facing B...<br>
  at my real solve, I did y R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2&#x27; R&#x27; and y2  R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U R2. But after I figured out that if I do y&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2&#x27; R&#x27;, I got the other U perm, which is faster for me.<br>
   <br>
  51 moves/15.14 seconds = 3.37 moves/second<br>
   <br>
  Oh, and I did an average using just that scramble...best time was 11.36, and average was 13.37. Yeah, I know, I&#x27;m very slow...: )<br>

I took a shopping trip today, and there dosn&#x27;t seem to be any store 
that actually carries stepper motors.  Does anybody know where we can 
get one(or 6, rather) of them?

In response to Mr. Gates...we plan on building something similar to 
the model I saw on your site (1 motor attached to each face, so that 
they can all turn independently), except we will most likely be using 
k&#x27;nex for the frame.

I most of the stuff I needed from their store.  Although it is probably
easier at the store than online.  So if you live anywhere near
14928 Oxnard St.
Van Nuys, CA 91411
818-997-1806
you are probably in luck.

and no need to call me Mr. Gates, I&#x27;m only 17 lol

Good luck with the robot

Shouldn&#x27;t this, then, prove that a pop is the fault of the cuber? :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

Everyone adopts their own cubing style, so when we write rules, we 
cannot consider the style at all.  Obviously, this rule would affect 
people who are prone to popping differently than people who never pop, 
and so instead, we go and consider what ultimately cubing is about.  In 
my mind, and people may disagree, cubing is the art of solving the cube 
by turning the faces and realigning the puzzle.  I feel that 
misalignment and forcibly turning the puzzle is not a part of the 
puzzle solution, and so the pops the result from it are not condoned.

If pops really aren&#x27;t the fault of the cuber, then those people who 
feel this way should have been spending time previously to get a rule 
of &#x27;infinite pops&#x27; added to the regulations.  It would work the same 
way, since we can agree that basically no one pops on purpose, 
therefore if pops are not the fault of the cuber, you should get an 
extra solve.  If you pop five times, you keep solving until you have 
five solves where you are happy, and then there&#x27;s your average.  Why 
wasn&#x27;t this advocated in the past?  Based on the logic that no pop is 
the fault of the competitor, I see it as the only fair way to run a 
competition.

Instead, we allowed one.  We recognized, and everyone recognized by not 
complaining, that the fault is somewhat the fault of the competitor.  
How much, it remains to be debated.  The argument for pops being 
rewarded extra solves in a competition must address the following 
issue: why is popping fundamentally unavoidable while solving a cube?

Speed is definitely want, but not at the expense of accuracy.  We want 
to solve the cube as fast as possible, but it doesn&#x27;t give us the 
liberty to be sloppy about it.  In Sport Stacking (Cup Stacking), if 
you go faster, you fumble.  If you fumble and not over the cups, you 
have to fix it.  They don&#x27;t give you an extra attempt.  You have to 
choose what combination of speed and caution you want to use while 
solving the cube, and it has always been this way.  You could go too 
fast and put in an F2L pair of the wrong color, but that doesn&#x27;t award 
you an extra solve.

Can you explain why popping is not the fault of the cuber?  I haven&#x27;t 
seen that question answered yet, and I really need it to be answered.  
What is it about solving the cube that popping is unavoidable?  Why is 
exercising more caution during the solve against the principles of 
solving a cube as fast as possible?  How come accuracy is something 
that should be left up to chance, instead of being mandated by the 
competitor solving the cube?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Now u are just being platonistic. I never said that i supported what 
u &quot;suggest&quot; now. If ppl pop every solve they won&#x27;t ever be able to 
get 3/4/5 non-popping solves. Also i asked to hear any reason that 
current rule hasn&#x27;t worked. My view here is more aristotelic ;-)

I already explained why popping is not (solely) the fault of the 
cuber. And why would i need to elaborate on that anyway. U feel that 
no-pop is the way to go and i feel it&#x27;s wrong. U are on the WCA 
board and i&#x27;m not. I will accept whatever rules you come upp with as 
long as they are fair and not overly strict. No-popping is a 
borderline case where i do feel the current regulations are good.

About twisting centers on larger cubes i feel the current 
rules/practice is not good. One does NOT have full control over the 
centers if they want to twist or not. Why be punished when all 
cubies are in place and the cube is solved? As i said earlier there 
is NO ambiguity whether the cube is solved with one on more twisted 
centers. One broken center also causes no ambiguity. Two or more 
broken centers will. I will define a broken center as when a center 
breaks into two or more pieces. Not if one center snaps half way 
only.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan,

Sorry, you guys, but you aren&#x27;t correct.

In probability there&#x27;s a thing called the law of large numbers. If you
generate a long enough string of numbers &quot;randomly&quot; that eventually
you would have every digit the same number of times. N oparticular
number is favored. Your answer relies upon this law of randomness.

What is actually wrong with the standard answere you gave is that one
is not dealing with a large number of choices, and, as such, odds *do
not apply.*

I went to a site with the software and made my choice and did not
switch and I won. Doing it more than once is outside the boundaries of
the game. 

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Did you play just one time?!
  Oh, no...I didn&#x27;t say that switching you&#x27;ll always win. I just said that you&#x27;ll win more times if you switch...Ok, let me give another example.
   
  Suppose your friend has a bag with 3 balls inside. 2 are red and 1 is blue. So, he says that if you take a ball, without looking, and that ball is the blue one, he&#x27;ll give you 10 dollars. So, you go and take one ball, but don&#x27;t look at it. Say you put in on your pocket. Then, your friend looks into the bag and takes out one red ball. And ask if you want to continue with the one that is in your pocket or change with the one left on the bag? What do you do?
   
  Now the explanation:
  your initial chance of taking the blue ball is 1/3, right? And what happens if you take the blue ball? The 2 red ones stay in the bag. So, the probability of the 2 red ones stay on the bag is the same as you taking the blue, which is 1/3. Correct?
   
  and your initial chance of taking one red ball is 2/3, because you have 2 red balls. So, if you take one red ball, what happens? 1 red and 1 blue stay on the bag. Right? The probability of 1 red and 1 blue ball stay on the bag is the same as you taking a red one, which is 2/3. Correct?
   
  Now, if your friend takes a red ball, what will happen? If there were 2 red balls on the bag, now there&#x27;s 1 red ball. And if there were 1 red and 1 blue balls, now there&#x27;s just the blue. So, which event has greater possibility of happen? 2 reds or 1 red and 1 blue? For 2 reds, the posibility is 1/3, and for 1 red and 1 blue the possibility is 2/3. So, you have a greater chance of winning if you change your ball for the one in the bag. You&#x27;ll not win always, you&#x27;ll win 2/3 of the time and lose 1/3. 
   
  Make a test. Do it 10 times with each strategy like Stefan suggested and tell us the results...

  Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan,

Sorry, you guys, but you aren&#x27;t correct.

In probability there&#x27;s a thing called the law of large numbers. If you
generate a long enough string of numbers &quot;randomly&quot; that eventually
you would have every digit the same number of times. N oparticular
number is favored. Your answer relies upon this law of randomness.

What is actually wrong with the standard answere you gave is that one
is not dealing with a large number of choices, and, as such, odds *do
not apply.*

I went to a site with the software and made my choice and did not
switch and I won. Doing it more than once is outside the boundaries of
the game.

Oh, finding new algs is so much fun. Just yesterday I found three very

No this is not right. &quot;Likelihood&quot; does not apply to humans making
choices, even random ones. 

In the Rhine studies, with the strictest protocols, it was found that
humans in general consistantly &quot;guessed&quot; better than the &quot;odds&quot;
predicted. Those who believed they could do better than chance often
did much better than the odds, and those who refused to believe that
they could do better than chance consistantly did worst than the odds
predicted.

While you can artificially construct &quot;natural numbers,&quot; often examples
given of randomness, like dice throwing and Brownian motion, have been
found to *not* be random.

Minor pieces of advice for 3 and 4:

Use U turns to save on rotations and make F and B turns easier.  Try
those algs like this:

(R&#x27; U&#x27; R)(F R2 D&#x27;)(R U R&#x27; D)(R2 d&#x27; L&#x27;)
(F R2 U&#x27;)(R2 U)(R2 d) R&#x27;(L U2 L&#x27;)

Also, for all of the Pi, T, and U COLL algs you&#x27;re having problems
with, I suggest heading to the ZB group to check out.  We&#x27;ve been
generating huge lists of algs for them, and I&#x27;m sure you can find
something you like.

greater possibility of happen? 2 reds or 1 red and 1 blue? For 2 reds,
the posibility is 1/3, and for 1 red and 1 blue the possibility is
2/3. So, you have a greater chance of winning if you change your ball
for the one in the bag. You&#x27;ll not win always, you&#x27;ll win 2/3 of the
time and lose 1/3.

          <div class="email-content">I did 100 trials, swithing my choice for 50 and keeping my choice for
the other 50.

The results:

When keeping choice:  16/50 wins => 32%
When changing choice:  32/50 wins => 64%
Overall total:  48/100 wins => 48%
Conclusion:  You are twice as likely to win if you change your choice.

There was obviously a clear distinction between keeping my choice and
changing it.

I used this to play:
http://people.hofstra.edu/staff/steven_r_costenoble/MontyHall/MontyHallSim.html

Think of it this way:

When you are shown one of the empty doors, your chances of winning by
keeping your original choice is still 1/3, not 1/2.  The door shown to
you was not chosen at random.

Stefan, how do you find new algs? Do you use a special program?

Thanks all.  I used a flat-bladed screwdriver and my cube as token

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I also support rewarding no extra solve for a Pop in a 5-solve, 
average-of-middle-3 competition. With our old rule it&#x27;s possible to 
Pop twice without seriously affecting your average. Just call the 
first one a Pop to get another solve, and the second one will be your 
slowest solve and won&#x27;t be counted in the average. (Of course, I 
realize that this may make a slower solve count in the average, but 
that&#x27;s not a big problem if your solves are fairly consistent.) Out 
of the six solves, this means you can solve just 4 and still have an 
average where the three solves that count don&#x27;t have Pops. Is that 
really stiff? I  feel that 66.6% non-Pop rate deserves a heavier 
penalty than that.

(This is a relatively light penalty compared to 2-second penalty, in 
my opinion. I&#x27;m still a bit bummed out about my 16.47+ in the second 
round in Florida. Of all the permutations, I had to get the worse one 
of the N perms, and messed up the finish. And U-face was off by a lot 
less than 45 degrees. Of course, I really deserved it because I 
managed to get another penalty on the fourth solve, this time without 
any good excuse.)

So let&#x27;s all try not to Pop more than 20% of the time from now on! 
Plus, it won&#x27;t affect your average if the Pop happens on your slowest 
solve. I really hope no one has to sacrifice his speed so much just 
to achieve an 80% non-Pop rate...and really there&#x27;s no excuse when 
you can buy a good cube at Target for $10.

Ok, so everyone has bad luck from time to time, and it&#x27;s possible 
that you Pop twice in an average. But the same can be said about 
almost every aspect of speedcubing (like my N perm). That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re 
changing to 5 solves for both 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. And just because I 
find this so amusing, here&#x27;s a minilien to the original post:

Happy holidays,
Macky

          <div class="email-content">So you say it&#x27;s a 100% that I win if I stay... awesome conclusion. Just 
awesome...

You can&#x27;t drag the law of large numbers into this the way you are doing. 
It has nothing to do with odds only being true for many trials or not. 
It merely states that if you do something enough times it will converge 
towards the &quot;true&quot; odds. Which in this case is 1/3 and 2/3. So what it 
in fact can be used for is to make the choices many times (like others 
suggested), ad them up and calculate odds that come nearer and nearer to 
the real odds. In this way you can &quot;prove&quot; that the odds are in fact 1/3 
and 2/3 if you do it enough times. I challenge you to repeat Bob&#x27;s 100 
trials and and test your hypothesis against a 95% confidence interval or 
so...

With a solid year or so at university in probability and statistics and 
very confident in this. Ask all the probability/statistics professors in 
the world if the odds are 1/3 and 2/3, and I strongly believe that the 
law of large numbers will make the will make this converge towards 100% 
agreeing. In fact I challenge you to ask a single probability/statistics 
professor about this and let us all know about his/her answer.

Take on the one or both of the challenges above and then come back and 
say it&#x27;s not true. I bet you my upcoming 2x2x2 average WR that you can&#x27;t 
do it ;)

Hmm... look at the recent WC final round: 12 competitors, 60 solves, 
not a single pop! Not one! Would you say they didn&#x27;t go full speed in 
order not to pop? Why would they do that with the old rules?

Oh, and... more importantly... how come you&#x27;re talking about DNFs?

You&#x27;ll only get DNF if you *finish* with a pop, i.e. you pop and stop 
the timer with the pop not fixed. And you&#x27;d have to do that *twice* to 
affect your average. How likely is that?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Excellent explanation!  When I was young and knew everything, I KNEW
that changing doors didn&#x27;t matter.  So I wrote a short program to run
around 1000000 tests of this and catalogue how often the contestant
won after switching, and how oftent they won after not switching.  It
was always very close to 1/3 without switching and 2/3 after
switching.  I eventually figured out the logic behind the below post,
and was convinced.
  Interestingly, (now that I am older, wiser, and have a bit better
math background) I used this same approach from time to time to check
my work on a few probability assignments that I really felt shakey on.
 It&#x27;s not highly efficient, but it lets me combine two things I really
enjoy: Math and Programming.

I think the origin of the somewhat odd custom of not counting the best 
and worst time is to measure a representative average (&quot;average 
average&quot;) without having extreme cases affect the result, but in 
practice it does serve to make it OK to have a few mistakes. And I 
think that&#x27;s good, even though I would agree that those mistakes are 
the fault of the solver. Though at the other end, it *is* pretty weird 
that the fastest solves don&#x27;t even count.  I can&#x27;t think of another 
sport that does that.

If there were really no pops at all in the latest final, that does show 
it&#x27;s not much to worry about, at least for people in that level.

          <div class="email-content">I think that has something to do with the nature of our sport.  In most 
competitive sports where timing is involved, i.e. track and field or 
swimming or any type of race, the athlete exerts maximum effort 
(generally) in each run.  There isn&#x27;t as big of an element of 
randomness or luck.  Okay, weather, temperature, track surface, 
psychological things all play a part, but the sport itself does not 
have inherent randomness.

Cubing however has randomness.  Without defining what random or 
favorable or unfavorable is, we can all agree that favorable and 
unfavorable conditions come up with each solve and are beyond the 
control of anyone.  I guess that&#x27;s why I feel truncating the times in 
an average is slightly more appropriate.  I&#x27;m not justifying it 
completely, but it makes some sense.

          <div class="email-content">I like this explanation :

&quot;There are three possible scenarios, each with equal probability (1/3):

    * The player picks goat number 1. The game host picks the other
goat. Switching will win the car.
    * The player picks goat number 2. The game host picks the other
goat. Switching will win the car.
    * The player picks the car. The game host picks either of the two
goats. Switching will lose.

In the first two scenarios, the player wins by switching. The third
scenario is the only one where the player wins by staying. Since two
out of three scenarios win by switching and each scenario is equally
likely, the odds of winning by switching are 2/3. In other words, a
player who has a policy of always switching will win the car on
average two times out of the three.&quot;

Did you buy it new that way? Or did you or someone build this magic 
with the pictures from rubiks.com? The red one I bought new a while 
ago has truly connected rings and they also look better.

The pictures on rubiks.com don&#x27;t connect the rings, both for normal 
and master magic. Pretty sad.

little force is required to turn it.

Here&#x27;s a link to the one I did:
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs373/Labs/Web/W05/Rubic%20Cube%
20Web/index.html

As long as it turns faster than 1 turn per second should be the 
basic goal. I had to go into and mod the motors to do what I wanted 
though... and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with over-volting them a bit :0.

I had it run a human method (CFCE), but if you can implenment an 
optimal solver, that would be great.

Are you planning on doing color recognition too?

Ah, ok. Yeah, that would be nice :-). The more solves the better. Uh, 
except that more solves require fewer or faster competitors or fewer 
rounds...

Yes, there really weren&#x27;t any. And only 2 (declared) pops in the semi 
final, i.e. 2 pops in 182 solves (36 competitors). Don&#x27;t know about 
round 1, there are no pops but dnfs and they could mean anything.

Looking at the WC 2003 results, I don&#x27;t see any pops at all. But I 
could imagine that the free-replacement-for-pops rule didn&#x27;t exist 
back then, is that correct?

Hehe, you&#x27;re able to build a cube solving robot but not to shrink a 
picture appropriately? :-)

How about using this instead:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/img_1556b.JPG

That&#x27;s only 1/31 of the original size, meaning it will load about 31 
faster! Seriously, why do you use a 2MB picture that everybody has to 
download, if you let the browsers shrink it and don&#x27;t even link to the 
picture so people can see it in the original size? Oh hey, and 
browsers are pretty bad at scaling so if you do it beforehand with a 
picture editing program you also get better quality.

Btw, use tinyurl.com and your link will actually be clickable:

  I think I figured out what the last character in the manufacturing 
code is for.  Apparently, cubes with flat centers are known as type A, 
and are marked as such.  The newer arched centers are type B, also 
marked accordingly.

For those who don&#x27;t know about the code, you can find it on Hasbro-era 
cubes by rotating each face 45 degrees.  It will be on one of the 
corner pieces, a 6-character code designating the year, month, and 
cube type.  Example:

M1005B

This is a cube manufactured in October 2005 with arched centers.

I guess the M stands for &quot;manufacture&quot; since they all seem to start 
with M.  Anybody have any codes that conflict with this scheme?

You can leave it like this and have the only known Unlinked solved
magic in the world, or print some new rings.
(then you&#x27;d have to remove several strings, change the design, and restring it).

It&#x27;s up to you ;-)

  Well that stinks,

I&#x27;ve got 2 of the white kits on the way and the pictures all show them
with the arched centers.

How long ago did you buy your white kits?

Thanks,

Eric

          <div class="email-content">I got some white ones as recently as October and they were still 
type A.  For some reason, Rubiks.com altered their photo of the 
white kit to depict arched centers.  This has led to speculation 
that white type B cubes are in the making.  They still limit us to 2 
cubes per order, like it&#x27;s some limited edition thing.  So it may 
take a while to clear their existing type A stock.

          <div class="email-content">Because you can&#x27;t say that &quot;the choice&quot; made by a human was &quot;random.&quot;
On top of that this randomness is supposed to apply to many humans.

The abstract assumption &quot;with no paricular preference of choice,&quot;
behind this would require that humans have no ideosyncracies.

          <div class="email-content">That is very very sad. I knew their pictures they offered for 
download/print were wrong but at least the magics they produced were 
correct. So now they&#x27;re selling magics with wrong pictures? Keep in 
mind that the &quot;subtitle&quot; of the orinal magics was &quot;link the rings&quot; and 
&quot;unlink the rings&quot;, not &quot;(un)stack the rings&quot;. Very very sad. I mean, 
why are they doing this? Would it cost them more money/effort to do it 
right? I believe not. Same thing with the &quot;jigsaw&quot; cube puzzle which 
shows a horribly invalid cube. It makes me sad they show so very 
little respect for the puzzles.

You just said that I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t put in the realm of the law of large
numberfs, and then you immediately defend its position within the
realm of large numbers. You can&#x27;t have it both ways - either it
applies or it doesn&#x27;t. 

The number of games is part of where you are going wrong. There is one
trial is the classic example - what effect does it have on one game?
None. In the same way that you cannot predict when a radiactive atom
will decay.

I wrote a program in Basic on an Atati 800. Making a choice between 1,
2, and 3 generated at random, I decided never to switch. Out of 100
&quot;games&quot; I &quot;won the car&quot; 76 times.

Why should I answer a challenge which is dependent upon how well
another person thinks?

I&#x27;m sorry you lost the bet. You probably had your heart set on the
2x2x2 average WR.

By removing the human element your computer program only shows that
the pseudo-&quot;random number generator&quot; you used works well within a

That&#x27;s more evidence to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It 
really is no problem timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due 
to (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not 
having to worry too much about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic 
is &quot;out-debated&quot;. What happens will happen. Unless the WCA board 
decides that we gonna have a vote or something over it :-)

I have written lots here about popping, but still my main concerns 
are that twisting centers should be allowed and also a single broken 
center (or any single cubie) as long as there is no ambiguity the 
cube/puzzle is solved. There is no way to benefit from those cube 
defects :-)

I don&#x27;t think so (and not only because I think &quot;evidence&quot; is the wrong 
word).

The reason for not allowing an extra solve is *not* to save time. And 
it&#x27;s *not* to punish people. And it&#x27;s *not* to prevent abuse. The 
reason is that it&#x27;s plain *wrong* to allow an extra attempt just 
because you made a mistake. You didn&#x27;t answer my question: What would 
you tell me if I asked for an extra attempt because I screwed up the 
OLL?

And you say the fact that 12 people in 60 solves with the old rules (!
!) not popping once (!) suggests we need to keep that rule? I don&#x27;t 
understand. I see it the opposite way.

Cheers!
Stefan

Screwing up your OLL is YOUR fault, not the cube in any way 
whatsoever. If you cannot see the difference i feel sorry for you ;-
) I don&#x27;t  understand anyone who can use such extreme ways to argue 
for or against something. Like :

- allowing ONE pop ... OMG then we MUST allow many pops ...
- popping is same as screwing up OLL

I call such arguments platonistic,not trying to see compromises in 
solutions to practical problems ;-)

The understanding that all POP&#x27;s are due to human mistakes is wrong. 
I have argued enough for this already ...

PS! The last question is not for me :-) I never wrote that ...

Hi Pedro,

I don&#x27;t see why not, though I don&#x27;t know where you can find an Atari 800. 
To do what I did you need to program the computer yourself.

The fundamentals:
Have the computer raise it&#x27;s &quot;game&quot; counter by one, 
When the &quot;game&quot; counter surpasses 100 have the computer tell you the #
of &quot;wins.&quot;
randomly generate a number, either 1, 2, or 3, 
have it ask you for input, 
You input the number one two or three, 

(You can figure out how to eliminate one of the other &quot;doors&quot; to
choose again.)

This must take the same amount of time every time, whether you guessed
correctly or not. There must not be even a fraction of a second
difference in this procedure viv a vis the correctness of your first
choice. If there is, your mind can perceive it, and effect your second
choice.

Have a procedure for keeping or switching your choice.

have the computer compare your input to the generated number, 
if they match, have the computer raise the &quot;win&quot; counter by one. 
Do *not* have the computer tell you whether you have won or lost
except at the end.
Start over

Get the idea?

Regards,

David J

I still think their motivation for editing those shots was that the

Stefan,

If I thought you were stupid I would not put so much effort into
explaining my thoughts on the matter.

I did the experiment and reported the result. If the result does not
coincide with your beliefs that is not my problem.

If you did not check the program that you used for this test, to see
it there was any time difference between processing a correct initial
guess and processing an incorrect initial guess, then you cannot tell
me for certain that you know that you got no feedback cues whatsoever.

Did you check?

Bye,

David J

So far, the latest arguments have all been that humans are able to

answer when they don&#x27;t know any information regarding the answer at 
all.  However, can you agree that a computer playing the game will win

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think that that new pop rule will change much.

When you train with your cube, I&#x27;m pretty sure nobody pops more than
twice in 5 solves (of course it could happen, but then it means either
your cube is bad and you should fix it,  or that you turn when the
faces are not aligned).

In both cases, the cuber could minimise the risk of popping far under
one in 5 solves.

SAME door every time and SWAP afterwards you will have the SAME (as in
similar) results in the long run.
If you really tried this 100 times without swapping and had it right 76
times it only means you are a hell of a lucky fellow.

I don&#x27;t know if someone can &quot;intuit&quot; a solution but many cubers<br>
started cubing using their own abilities and found their own solution.<br>
<br>
My experience with the cube without method was that: First I found<br>
that doing a layer was quite easy. Then the first thing that came to<br>
me was the opposite corners, but I was obsessed to not break my 1st<br>
layer, I found 1 sequence for corner permutation and another for<br>
orientation. then I was lokking for an alg to put one edge from the<br>
middle layer to the Down layer. then I tried to find sequences that<br>
didn&#x27;t change the 2 layers i&#x27;ve built and find an edge orientation<br>
alg. To conclude, permute middle layer edges was quite intuitive.<br>
<br>
Thats how I&#x27;ve discovered my method..or &quot;intuit&quot; it because after that<br>
i could always solve the cube in less than 5 mins.<br>
<br>
Keep on cubing.<br>

Well, at least some people have learned to solve the cube by
themselves. I guess they use some kind of commutators, because they
are understandable for a human. But I don&#x27;t know.

I&#x27;ve heard that someone, who was very bad at maths, learned to solve
the cube in a month. And I&#x27;ve also heard that John Nunn once solved a
cube in 6 hours...

          <div class="email-content">Well I may have put it badly. Of course the law of large number applies, 
it&#x27;s a law after all. But what you used is not the law of large numbers 
at all. Funny thing was that you can actually use the law of large 
numbers to &quot;prove&quot; the answer will be 1/3, 2/3. Here&#x27;s the law of large 
number in case you forgot it : 
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeakLawofLargeNumbers.html

You also believe that the odds of rolling a 6 on a regular six sided 
dice is not 1/6? That this cannot be true because it does not apply for 
a single roll? Maybe there&#x27;s a 50/50 chance on for each number? This may 
sound stupid, and it is... but it&#x27;s not very different from your argument.

Please read the law of large numbers again and revise your use of it.

months to do it :(

I used a sort of corners first method, coz i thought that was the most
intutive for me. I just played around with diferent situations and
found out the algos i needed by trial-and-error mostly. I found out
the sune by myself :)

By that method i could do the cube in around 3-4 mins, but then i
shifted to Fridrich method.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

I think everything has been said now about extra attempt for pops. Thank you 
all for your input.
There is still a majority favoring no extra attempts for pops, even for the 
bigger cubes. In return these cubers get 5 instead of 3 attempts.
Let us see what 2006 brings.

Stefan, for WC2003 there were no clear regulations about the cubing itself. 
Actually there were a few people (even finalists) getting extra attempts for 
having the last face not correctly aligned. On one occasion there was 
someone getting two extra attempts for the same cube. And each of the three 
scrambles was the same! There was also no limit for pops, so there was 
someone who had 3 pops, and received 3 extra attempts. Another thing was 
that the regulations were very personal, one judge would react differently 
than another judge.
We should be happy now that we have good regulations. :-)

About the twisted center corner of Masayuki Akimoto.
It is my mistake that the twisted center corner for Masayuki for his 5x5x5 
attempt was not allowed.
The judge came to me together with Masayuki, and asked me whether it was 
allowed or not. Even Masayuki said that he would not have a problem if it 
were not allowed.
I was in doubt at that moment, so I should have checked the regulations.
The regulations 2005 say:
&quot;
All pieces of the puzzle must be ATTACHED to the puzzle for it to be solved. 
If a piece of the puzzle is EJECTED as the puzzle is placed down but it is 
otherwise solved, then the puzzle is not considered to be in a solved state.
&quot;

The piece was attached, but ejected and not in solved position. Reading back 
now I think it should have been allowed.
I am glad in the end it did not make much of a difference. Although I am not 
sure whether it was Masayuki&#x27;s fastest time of the competition and thus a 
Japanese record.

My mistake. Sorry. Lesson learnt.

About the center corner of 5x5x5 being broken.
The regulations 2005 say:
&quot;If a non functional part of a puzzle is defect/ejected and the puzzle is 
still unambiguously in a solved state, then the puzzle is considered solved, 
under discretion of the judge.&quot;
In this case you could consider the flat part of the center corner to be a 
non functional part, because the inner part of the center is still in place. 
If the puzzle is unambiguously in a solved state, so only one of the center 
corners with this problem, then the puzzle should be considered solved.

Looking forward to more competitions in 2006 in more countries, with even 
more fun.

Have fun,

Ron

Hi !

That&#x27;s more evidence to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It
really is no problem timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due
to (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not
having to worry too much about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic
is &quot;out-debated&quot;. What happens will happen. Unless the WCA board
decides that we gonna have a vote or something over it :-)

I have written lots here about popping, but still my main concerns
are that twisting centers should be allowed and also a single broken
center (or any single cubie) as long as there is no ambiguity the
cube/puzzle is solved. There is no way to benefit from those cube
defects :-)

          <div class="email-content">You could calculate how much of your lifetime you&#x27;ve already wasted 
for cubing :-). And then argue that you haven&#x27;t wasted enough because 
your goal is to reach every possible state. Imagine...

- you could twist (the corner tips) with the speed of light
- you&#x27;d twist your whole life (assume 100 years)
- never visit a state twice so you don&#x27;t waste time

How much of the cube space would you visit? If I didn&#x27;t make a 
mistake, it&#x27;s about 35.7% which I think is a very nice number cause 
it&#x27;s large enough to be graspable and doesn&#x27;t reach 100%.


Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I agree, looking ahead is the most important thing for the largest
part of the cube solution.
I suggest you reach 20 seconds for F2L (cross included), then swith to
2-Look LL (or use a basic edge control).
Then try to reach 15 seonds for the F2L, then improve your algs for
the LL, then 10 seconds F2L, then sub5 for the LL, then you are one of
the best :D

You guess on door #1. The host is staying in front of door #3. Door #2 is 2 meters away from him, nevertheless he opens that door. What would you expect to find behind door #3? A goat?! (Let us exclude double-crossing!).

Changing wins if and only if you initially chose the wrong door, i.e. 
two times of three.

Can you explain why your suggestion makes this wrong?

          <div class="email-content">This doesn&#x27;t make the argument wrong. Yes, you can gain some knowledge 
this way and be more sure that changing would be better. But it 
doesn&#x27;t make you win more often when changing. The probability for 
that stays at 2/3.

I knew a similar case as yours, but here&#x27;s a really extreme one: After 
you pick your first door, the host opens *all* three doors and let&#x27;s 
you stay or change. Even with this 100% knowledge (because you see the 
car), changing is successful exactly 2/3 of the time, namely in those 
cases where you were initially wrong.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s true.  You need precise finger muscles, and 
enough strength to turn the sides which depends on the stiffness of the 
cube.  I do not really believe that anyone achieves strong fingers and 
wrist muscles as a result of cubing.  You can get hurt, such as 
repetitive stress syndrome, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re strong.

I think the racket hand of a badminton player could crush any of us.  
Wow, it&#x27;s raining hard.

          <div class="email-content">Come on, we&#x27;re adding in all these things that basically require ESP or 
some other type of extra-human perception.  Even if the host was right 
handed, it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference.  If you choose door 1, and the 
prize is behind door 2, and door 3 is 10 kilometers away from both you 
and the host, the host is going to have to run 10 kilometers to door 3 
because he can&#x27;t possibly open door 2.  (I think his goal, though, 
would be to run it in under 40 minutes.)

Right-handed or left handed doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  Even if the 
host is trying to make you lose, he can&#x27;t.  He only has one choice of 
door to open if you select a door without a prize.  Humans do not have 
any sense of selecting the right answer.  If anyone wants to take a 
1000 question multiple choice test right now, without knowing the 
questions,  or the answers, I&#x27;ll write a computer program right now.  
And I HATE programming.

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Good thinking Stefan!&quot; ? He is contradicting himself when saying: &quot;you can gain some knowledge this way and be more sure that changing would be better...but... the probability stays at 2/3&quot;. But if we had a probability of 2/3 whithout this knowledge and then bettered it, how can we still stay at 2/3?  He is discussing the a priori probabilities before the first choise, *I* am discussing the probabilities before the second choice, that is, when the host has opened one door. There is some concensus here that the probabilities are 1/3 or 2/3. But if we accept the theoretical assumtion (Pochmann apparently does) that the host has an &quot;easy&quot; door and a &quot;difficult&quot; door and he chooses the first with a probability of 1/2 + epsilon and the second with a probability 1/2 - epsilon (epsilon not 0), the result will be another.
Ask mister Pochmann to calculate the probabilities for you. Mister Bayes may help him.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s a hilarious idea, but with the sad undertone that this discussion 
has even gone this far.  The probability of winning the game if you 
switch the door is 2/3.  We make several assumptions:

No one is &quot;out to get you.&quot;
The host offers you the switch every single time.
The host knows which door the prize is behind.
Psychics are full of crap.

Just play the game yourself.  This &quot;law of large numbers&quot; not applying 
is false.  Probability doesn&#x27;t mean that something will or won&#x27;t 
happen, it&#x27;s how often it should happen.  If we carry out an infinite 
number of tests, well, and I think it&#x27;s called the central limit 
theorem but I&#x27;m not certain, the probabilities should even out to about 
2/3 and 1/3.  If you do it 1000 times, the probability will generally 
come out to 2/3 and 1/3, but it won&#x27;t be exact, and it could come out 
weird... you could win 1000 times in a row.  At the same time, I could 
tunnel through a brick wall.  That&#x27;s probability.

Play the game yourself.  Work out the probability, read the actual text 
of the problem as stated on that website, and if we can agree on the 
text of the problem, and the manner of which the game is played, there 
is no doubt that probability is 2/3 and 1/3.  There is no +epsilon or 
-epsilon because for the sake of a math problem, no one is right handed 
or left handed.  No one has a preference, pure randomness is possible.

Honestly, if you were playing the game, would you actually stay with 
the door you chose because you believe the probability of you winning 
is 1/2?  If so, you deserve to lose that car.  In fact, why don&#x27;t we do 
this.  I&#x27;ll be the host of this game and I&#x27;ll give you 100 trials.  The 
prize behind the door in my game will be $5 USD.

Then, you be the host, and you give me 100 trials.  The prize behind 
the door in your game is $4 USD.  I&#x27;ll switch the door every time, and 
you keep your door every time.  If the probability is 1/2, I think you 
stand to make $50 USD in this game.  Who&#x27;s up for it?

I&#x27;m putting up money here.  Those who are convinced of their answer 
should step up.  I&#x27;m convinced of my answer, and I&#x27;m putting my money 
where my mouth is.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Stafan<br>
 <br>
many thanks for the centers explanation.<br>
 <br>
and i was looking more in to this method.<br>
 <br>
i came up with this:<br>
Building center + edges.<br>
 <br>
I started playing with (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr)<br>
 <br>
do the this alg and see what i mean: (Rr&#x27;) F&#x27; (Rr) (rev. of the <br>
above)<br>
 <br>
You see UB UF UR FL FD edges pairs.<br>
 <br>
i solve the centers up to when i see that 3 centers needs to be <br>
placed.<br>
 <br>
1th step:<br>
Look at UB edges then first im looking for UBr and place that in UFl <br>
and then UFr to the FDl and do (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr) <br>
Then 2 edge pairs are connected.<br>
and 2 centers to go.<br>
 <br>
2nd step:<br>
Looking at UB the first look at UBl and place the temporay in URb <br>
then look at UBr place that in UFl and then UFr to the FDl then FDr <br>
to the URf<br>
then i do L to set URb in place on FLu  Then do (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr)<br>
Then 4 edge pairs are connected<br>
and 1 center to go<br>
 <br>
3rd step:<br>
repeat step 2<br>
Then 4 edge pairs are connected<br>
and centers done.<br>
and left with.<br>
1 left with 3 edge pairs to connect<br>
2 left with 2 edge pairs to connect<br>
3 all edges solved<br>
4 not run into any others yet<br>
 <br>
and i have been trying this also with just step 1 repeated 3 time&#x27;s <br>
then 6 edges are done<br>
im much faster with this and maybe when you can do it 5 times then <br>
10 edges are solved.<br>
but i think that will be harder but not tested yet.<br>
 <br>
I think the first explanation is good for the people who used to the <br>
6 edges method<br>
 <br>
With this method you can start quicker to connecting edges.<br>

That&#x27;s correct, sorry. I did get your mail but didn&#x27;t have time enough 
to play with your ideas. And hey, that was only two days ago or so, 
wasn&#x27;t it? :-) Anyway, good idea at first look but I&#x27;ll have to study 
it more... If you have good results, let us know.

Thanks!

Never tried a heavier weight.  What do you like better about it?

Hehe, you better don&#x27;t remove the important parts of the quote :-). I 
was talking about two different things. I said:

The probability that &quot;change&quot; wins the car stays at 2/3 and the 
probability for &quot;keep&quot; stays at 1/3. The extra knowledge doesn&#x27;t help 
to make these strategies any better, &quot;keep&quot; wins if and only if your 
initial choice was correct (1/3) and &quot;change&quot; wins if and only if it 
was wrong (2/3).

What you *can* do with this extra knowledge is make up a *better 
strategy* than those two. In my extreme example where you get to see 
the car, a good strategy would be &quot;keep my door if and only if it 
contains the car&quot;. This *new* strategy wins the car 100% of the time.

Now what about the situation you described? The game is the same but 
you get extra information from the behaviour of the host. Can you use 
it to make up a new strategy?

Hmmmmm.... actually I just noticed something. Gotta think about it, 
will be back when I&#x27;m done with that. But I&#x27;m gonna submit the above 
now anyway.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">No, I&#x27;m not pointing to you.  It&#x27;s a general &quot;you,&quot; though at this 
point, I&#x27;m surprised that no one has taken up my offer.  Especially the 
people who claim that the probability is even at 1/2 and 1/2.

At the end of this, I&#x27;ll even give back the money that you lost if you 
concede that the probability is indeed 1/3 and 2/3.  Look, there&#x27;s no 
money lost here.  I&#x27;m giving people who believe that the probability is 
1/2 and 1/2 a risk free opportunity to prove themselves, and make a 
little money while they&#x27;re at it if they&#x27;re correct.

drops out of the cube more easily, and I think it feels more &quot;sticky&quot;. 
Wet your hands with water, press them against each other and slide 
them against each other. It actually makes it stiffer than when my 
hands are dry. Silicone oil just makes the sliding easier (I believe..
. I admit I never really tried that :-). Same with 50 vs 1000, the 50 
gives me a more sticky feeling I think.

What exactly does the &quot;weight&quot; value describe? It&#x27;s certainly not the 
weight of the oil itself, my 1000 weighs about the same as my 50, 
certainly not 20 times as much :-)

WHAT ?!? No speedcubing yahoo group for several hours ?!? Are they

          <div class="email-content">I think one of the most important thing to point out to non cubers is that
the cube is made up of the smaller &quot;cubies&quot; if you will.  Alot of people
think that each sticker can be moved individually.  Another good one is the
difference between orientation and permutation.  Then, if you want to be
really ambitious, you can try to explain commutators, but I&#x27;ve never found a
good way to explain it in speech form, I always have to sit down and show
someone.  And you have to give them a website that they can visit to learn
more about the cube.

Just a couple of ideas,

Yeah could be 2 days ago sorry but i was to excited :)

but what i have so far is:
i do normale 2 egde method and avg around 1:15 and then left with 
the 3x3x3 solve
and with this new method im doing the avg is also around 1:15 but i 
do it much slower.

the avg im talking about is solve up to when you left with the 3x3x3 
so its not a compleet solve.

a reason for this, but I personally disagree (never happened to me, I just

scramble in the half turn metric, then this rule should also be applied in
the half turn metric.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Stefan Pochmann&quot; &lt;pochmann@...&gt;<br>

          <em>Date:</em> Wed, 28 Dec 2005 22:54:32 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Ok, I&#x27;m done. With this idea of gaining extra information (i.e. not 
like in the original pure probability riddle) I&#x27;m not sure we should 
talk about *the* probability that changing or keeping your door wins a 
certain fraction of all cases.

That&#x27;s because now it depends on your strategy. For simplicity, let&#x27;s 
consider my extreme hint example again where you *know* where the car 
is before your second decision. The probability for something is 
roughly speaking the good events divided by all events. Now if your 
strategy is &quot;keep if and only if I was right&quot; then you always win. 
That is, all your &quot;change&quot; decisions and all your &quot;keep&quot; decisions 
will win. Instead of 2/3 and 1/3 we now have 3/3 and 3/3. However, if 
your strategy is &quot;keep if and only if I was wrong&quot; then we drop to 0/3 
and 0/3.

So it depends on your strategy and thus speaking about *the* 
probability for keep/change doesn&#x27;t make much sense, at least not 
directly. I guess this term could make sense if you define it over 
*all strategies*, and then it might be 2/3 and 1/3 again, but I won&#x27;t 
dare to claim that cause now it&#x27;s getting too complicated :-)

If we talk about keep/change as strategies, short for &quot;I&#x27;ll always 
keep my door&quot; (or &quot;change&quot;), then 2/3 and 1/3 is correct. It&#x27;s also 
correct if your choice is random. Or if you always alternate between 
keep/change (unless the correct door alternates accordingly). Or other 
constructions that keep the 2/3 vs 1/3 probabilities for keep vs 
change. But inside other strategies, the probabilities can be very 
very different.

Cheers!
Stefan

Can you be more precise what you mean here? For me it sounds like you 
do my step 1, then during step 2 you only solve one center piece of 
each color into the l slice (because then 3 still need to be placed). 
But that seems a bit early...

Now your left with 3 peaces of centers to be done.

This confuses me... I think you&#x27;re trying to somehow keep the edge 
pairs you built in the 1st step intact, is that right? Actually a 
while ago I had this idea of building edges together with centers, but 
I gave up on it real quick because I kept destroying my edge pairs, or 
it was too much work to keep them intact. Looks like I should try 
again...

Is this a type or are really only 4 pairs connected, not 6?

> and i have been trying this also with just step 1 repeated 3 time&#x27;s

Can you point out more how your above method differs from just doing 
step 1 three times?

Btw, how have you been connecting edges so far? I use to build two 
pairs at a time, using algs like r&#x27; U&#x27; R U r.

Cheers!
Stefan

For some reason too difficult to explain here (but you can read it in 
the book of Baltalan and Leeves) I don&#x27;t think this is fair. We must 
play at the same time. For this, I suggest the following procedure 
(it&#x27;s basically the same game but initially with two players):

We need a third person who&#x27;ll be the host and you give him your $5 and 
I give him my $4. He places the $9 behind one of three doors. We both 
choose a door. If it&#x27;s the same we try again until we choose different 
ones. Then, only one of us can continue the game. The host opens an 
empty door, either yours or mine. The one who had this door is out, 
the other can choose to keep his door or change to the third door 
(which none of us chose). If the wrong door is chosen, we try again 
(playing for the same $9). We do this 10 times and you always switch 
and I always keep.

Ok?

Cheers!
Stefan

You have to watch what happen when you do (Rr)&#x27; F (Rr) The ones that 
are destroyed or build is UB UF UR FL FD
so when you just do step 1 you have to watch UR and FL

when doing the 1step then step 2 and 3:
1st: 2 edges correct
2nd: 4 edges corrert total 6
3th: 4 egdes correct total 9 or 10 or 12

But doing this its hard for me its kinda like the 6 edge method

No. If the computer takes longer to ask you if you want to switch
after you chose correctly this could be perceived, consciously or
unconsciously, and affect your choice.

Can you produce an honest refutation of the Rhine experiments?

You seem to guarantee that everyone will be wrong 2/3rds of the time.
There is no guarantee.

I think it&#x27;s possible. 
Are you using the same &quot;random number&quot; generator for both sides of the
game? They could accidently line up and the computer contestent could
choose correctly 100% of the time, and switching 100% of the time it
would lose 100% of the time.

I&#x27;m curious, what percentage of the time will the game be won if the
computer contestant switches it&#x27;s choice 2/3s of the time?

    Hey All,
 
 
     I am currently learning the algorithms (BigCubes.com) for solving the last Edges for the Professor Cube, but came across a snag.

It is well known that when the behavior of groups of humans may be
predicted, the behavior of individuals may not be predicted on the
same basis.

  dwayne, tell me which cases you are having problems with again, maybe identify it by the alg i give, i only have rows of three, so when you say 3 from the left its confusing as to whether u mean the most left or most right one. also tell me what cases you think you have found, its probably just a variant of one of the cases on there with a tredge upsidedown or something.

      Hey All,


       I am currently learning the algorithms (BigCubes.com) for solving the last Edges for the Professor Cube, but came across a snag. 
    
     Two of the algs on the page are incorrect and I&#x27;ve also found that there are more than the nine cases provided on the page. I managed to solve the error in one of the algs (top row third from left) although the other algorithm is too complex for me. 

  Can anyone solve the case correcting the provided algorithm: second row third from the left? 
  And does anyone know how many cases there are?    I&#x27;ve come across 11 so far (2 more than the site)

  This is the direct link to the above discussed page:

  Thanks Dwayne

Weight is a term describing viscosity.  The smaller the weithg number
the lower the viscosity.  The higher the weight the greater the viscosity.

Just another unit of measure as far as I know.

I&#x27;ll get some higher weight lube and try it out.

Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">In order to appease Stefan, I propose we play the game this way:

I put in $5, and you put in $4.  The combined $9 is put behind one of 
the three doors (or cups, or whatever).  I&#x27;ll let you choose the door.  
You choose the door, someone reveals a door without the money (that&#x27;s 
not the door you chose).  If the $9 is behind the original door you 
chose, you keep the money.  If it&#x27;s behind the other door, I&#x27;ll keep 
the money.  We repeat this 100 times.

I&#x27;m not arguing the probabilities of this game anymore.  Here&#x27;s the 
game.  Do you want to play?  If indeed the answer is 1/2, 1/2, then 
you&#x27;ll win $50.  If you have ESP and can perceive things, then you&#x27;ll 
win money.  I&#x27;m prepared to part with up to $500 for this game.

          <div class="email-content">No, I don&#x27;t guarantee that everyone who keeps the same door will be <br>
wrong 2/3rds of the time.  I know that if we carry this out to a large <br>
number, such as 100, that it is pretty much guaranteed that they will <br>
be wrong about 2/3rds of the time.  That&#x27;s what probability is.<br>
<br>
The game will be won if the contestant switches doors 2/3rds of the <br>
time is calculated by the following:<br>
<br>
(1/3)(1/3) + (2/3)(2/3) = 5/9<br>
<br>
The contestant will win 5 out of 9 times.<br>
<br>
Bob&#x27;s computer simulation shows that switching the door will win twice <br>
as often as not switching the door.  That&#x27;s 2/3 and 1/3 probability.  A <br>
quick look a Bob&#x27;s simulation shows, by calculation as I did earlier, <br>
that the overall outcome of 1/2 switch and 1/2 not switching should be <br>
1/2.  His experiment confirms exactly what we were looking for.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve already stated over and over again.  If you believe that a person <br>
will win 1/2 of the time by not switching, then play my game.  I&#x27;ll <br>
even up the stakes if you want to make more money off of me.<br>
<br>
I could give you arguments all day, but I&#x27;m not.  It&#x27;s simple, will you <br>
play my game?  Will you challenge my answer?  Unless there is some <br>
flawed mechanism of how I set up the game, prove to me that you&#x27;re <br>
right and earn your $50.  You could buy 5 cubes with that money.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just to argue a bit more in this thread (which is very silly) I have a 
couple of questions:

Are you suggesting that I still have 1/3, 2/3 (any way) when choosing at 
random or always alternating between staying/switching? If you did that 
should read 1/2, 1/2.

          <div class="email-content">Hi frens,<br>
<br>
I was the guy from Malaysia who posted 3 months ago about his first sub-<br>
30 average. Well, I reached another personal milestone today with my <br>
first non-lucky sub-20 time (19.61 secs)! YES! <br>
<br>
My next goal is to do a sub-20 average. My current best avg from 1.5 <br>
months back is 26.00 secs. That was mainly done with a 3-look LL. I&#x27;m <br>
learning OLL right now and knows about 80% of the algorithms at this <br>
moment. My non-lucky sub-20 time was done with a 2-look LL. I&#x27;ll start <br>
taking averages again once I&#x27;m done with all the OLL algo&#x27;s. Thanks a <br>
lot to the cubing community for sharing ideas and algo&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m on a working assigment in the United States (California) right now <br>
and looking forward to the Exploratorium competition in January. I <br>
won&#x27;t be competing but I&#x27;m eager to meet up with some you guys.<br>
<br>

Nah, that&#x27;s no good :-)

The funny thing about the version I proposed is that even though for 
the person playing the whole game it feels somewhat like the original 
game, the probabilities are reversed! In that game, keeping your door 
gets you 2/3 and switching only 1/3.

Damn, I was hoping to win easy 20 bucks from you...

Cheers!
Stefan

If you play randomly or alternate evenly, you&#x27;ll *overall* end up with 
the car 1/2 of the time.

But the *individual* probabilities for &quot;keep&quot; and &quot;switch&quot; stay the 
same: you&#x27;ll win 1/3 of all games in which you say &quot;keep&quot;, and you&#x27;ll 
win 2/3 of all games in which you say &quot;switch&quot;.

Cheers!

It&#x27;s also cheaper than the 3M silicone spray.  So far so good.

David asked me to apologize because he has done nothing to deserve my 
questioning of his honesty. So here I go. Sorry David, if you say so, 
I will believe it.

Actually getting 76 out of 100 isn&#x27;t so hard, after all you had 1/3 
chance each time, that&#x27;s not nothing. I haven&#x27;t computed the odds for 
it but I guess it&#x27;s not like it means you&#x27;re so lucky you should win 
the lottery every week so that instead of wasting your time trying to 
convince us with words, you could just fly all of us to your place and 
we could try your program and get convinced easily. It would also be 
cool to see research that&#x27;s not 70 years old. I encourage you to win 
the lottery a few times and then sponsor some new research. You could 
also hire a few crackers to shoot down this website which sells ESP 
stuff:
http://www.parascope.com

They pretend to believe in this stuff but they say:

&quot;Rhine is often popularly remembered as the man who &quot;proved&quot; that 
psychic powers existed. While he did collect some compelling test 
results that indicated statistically unlikely accuracy among his 
subjects, subsequent examinations of his work have concluded that 
procedural flaws and probability loopholes invalidate any claims of 
proof.&quot;

How can they dare to pretend they advocate ESP and the like if they 
attack completely honest and professional Mr Rhine? What a bad world 
this is...

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Is somebody capable of computing the odds for winning those 76 
out of 100?

Hello David,

Yes, I would also like to see your program and learn from it. You have 
put so much effort into making sure everything is done like it has to 
be done, I think it would be a waste to not show it.

Thank you,
Stefan

Hi again,

uh, I hope you&#x27;re not keeping it secret because you want to win the 
James Randi million dollar challenge?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi

If so, I would of course understand. You sure have way enough proof in 
your hands for it. On the other hand, with your &quot;luck&quot; or whatever it 
is, you should really win lottery every week I think.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">You can actually buy 2 different 5x5x5 cubes at Mefferts. Theres the
Eastsheen 5x which are stickered and differently constructed but
equally nice as a Rubiks 5x5x5. The other is the Tiled Mefferts
Professor which is exactly the same as a Rubiks 5x just with Tiles
instead of stickers. Neither puzzle uses B.O.Y color scheme. 

The 4x4x4 at Mefferts is an Eastsheen. 

&quot;better than the store bought cubes?&quot;

It depends who you ask, I like them all but I dont speedsolve the
bigger cubes (at least not very well). I can tell you they are all
quality puzzles.

Good Luck! -mike

          <div class="email-content"> that case 2nd row last one, i do it like this, 
with the tredges at FL and FR

U2u2 R2r2 F2 u2 F2 R2r2 U2u2

and notice the little u in between the F&#x27;s which means only
the u slice, not U.

the case number 1 that u drew there is acutally case # 2, 
but the tredge has been flipped upside down, if you do 
L&#x27; F U&#x27; 
you will see that you have case number 2 with FL on FU and FR on FD
or what i do is instead of placing them next to each other, i place
them two slots away (like i would first do R2 x2 on your example)and do the same 
thing as case 1 and 2 except the first and last move are 1/2 turns instead of 1/4.  
i don&#x27;t know if that makes sense but if you do an R2, you should see how
its the same case as number 2 but it is an extra slot away.  the second example
is also a similar situation, its acutally #7 but a tredge is flipped upside down,
you can remove it and put it in the other way using the same move from above.
hope this helps.

      Sorry my bad,
  
    Execution error. Can you verify the  top row far right?
 Shouldn&#x27;t the MUU2 be U2? Also here is the  attachment
  
 Thanks Dwayne

          <div class="email-content">Ya Evan is right. Most ppl dont have the concept of &quot;cubies&quot;. Explain
that surely to the kids.

Also what i try to do when explaining to others is the abstract
concept as to why any algorithm works. I say that if u do a move say X
and then Y and then if u reverse the moves, like X Y Y&#x27; X&#x27;, then
nothing will happen to the cube. But if u undo the first move first
then u get somethign like X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; and this changes the state of the
cube. Ofcourse dont use the &quot;&quot;X&quot; nad &quot;Y&quot; during ur talk or u&#x27;ll
confuse the kids.

And surely if the kids are bright then try to touch upon the concept
of commutators. From what i have seen, it surely is a little tough at
first making ppl understand commutators but once thats done its easy
to explain the whole last layer.

Also show different shapes on the cubes to entertain the kids..or
maybe teach them how to get to the patterns from a solved cube and
make them do it. It&#x27;ll be a sort of hands-on for them and they&#x27;ll
surely get interested.

Keep us informed how the tutorials go :)

Sachin.

No, that is indeed supposed to be true.  My claim was that switching
results in a win 2/3 of the time and staying with the original door
results in a win 1/3 of the time.  Instead, my results were 64% and
32% respectively (sorry, I was off by 2.7% and 1.3%).  Of course, with
a &quot;random&quot; strategy (switching half the time and keeping your choice
half the time), you should win (1/3)*(1/2) + (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/2 of the
time.

In theory, it should be (2/3)*(2/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) = 5/9 of the time.

The viscosity is measured in &quot;stokes&quot;, evidently an old measure and I can´t find any definition on it. (I guess;  the elasticity module. In diagrams the logarithms are shown).

Some of you will still beat me, though.. <br>
<br>
I was inspired by Bob Burton, who does the M2&#x27; with his (left) <br>
middle and ring finger. I now do it with my middle finger, starting <br>
with the tip of my finger at the UB edge sticker. However, it&#x27;s <br>
really awkward to do M2&#x27; that way... So I actually start with an L, <br>
then place my finger, and do L(L&#x27;M2&#x27;) at the same time. So the alg <br>
becomes: <br>
<br>
L(L&#x27;M2&#x27;) U L(L&#x27;M2&#x27;) U2 L(L&#x27;M2&#x27;)U L(L&#x27;M2&#x27;)<br>
<br>
Ok, I know it looks ugly, but it&#x27;s just a way of writing it to show <br>
how I execute it :). I don&#x27;t have a webcam here (I am at my parents <br>
house), but I&#x27;ll make a video soon.<br>
<br>
See you!<br>

This one is correct ;-)

This version of the alg is for speedsolving, if you want a purer
version so that it doesn&#x27;t mess the corners), do (r U2) *5 (r is the 2
layer counting from the right).

Good luck !
Gilles.

That looks very nice! I must admit first I thought I had done this 
before, because your explanation sounded similar to what I&#x27;ve been 
doing: L2 (LM)2&#x27;, Also pulling with my left middle finger, putting it 
on the FU sticker after the L2. This way my right hand stays fixed and 
only does the U&#x27;s while the left hand does all the other turns. I 
think it has to do with that it&#x27;s easier to rotate your hand &quot;towards&quot; 
you than &quot;away&quot; from you. But your way looks even better. Gotta try 
it...

Woah, I&#x27;d love to try that 10000... though, probably not right away in 
my best cube :-). My store had several in the range 50 to 1000 and I 
imagine 1000 is max. However, I just googled and &quot;viscosity 10000&quot; 
actually finds more results than &quot;viscosity 1000&quot;. Wow, 100000 finds 
even more! And searching for 10 million (!) still finds three results, 
one speaking of &quot;silicone *gum*&quot;:

Also, try this one for your slowest (case 56, 3.167 seconds):
(R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;)

And for case 54 try this:
y2 (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;)
Notice I only separate it in the middle because it&#x27;s two independent 
LL algs. But the R&#x27; F is of course really a finger trick.

Cheers!

Woah, I&#x27;d love to try that 10000... though, probably not right away in 
my best cube :-). My store had several in the range 50 to 1000 and I 
imagine 1000 is max. However, I just googled and &quot;viscosity 10000&quot; 
actually finds more results than &quot;viscosity 1000&quot;. Wow, 100000 finds 
even more! And searching for 10 million (!) still finds three results, 
one speaking of &quot;silicone *gum*&quot;:

     that case 2nd row last one, i do it like this, 
 with the tredges at FL and FR
 
 U2u2 R2r2 F2 u2 F2 R2r2 U2u2
 
 and notice the little u in between the F&#x27;s which means only
 the u slice, not U.
 
 the case number 1 that u drew there is acutally case # 2, 
 but the tredge has been flipped upside down, if you do 
 L&#x27; F U&#x27; 
 you will see that you have case number 2 with FL on FU and FR on FD
 or what i do is instead of placing them next to each other, i place
 them two slots away (like i would first do R2 x2 on your example)and do the same 
 thing as case 1 and 2 except the first and last move are 1/2 turns instead of 1/4.  
 i don&#x27;t know if that makes sense but if you do an R2, you should see how
 its the same case as number 2 but it is an extra slot away.  the second example
 is also a similar situation, its acutally #7 but a tredge is flipped upside down,
 you can remove it and put it in the other way using the same move from above.
 hope this helps.

Wrong! All you losers still don&#x27;t understand what David has explained. 
Humans are no computers, we have special mind powers defying the odds 
of probability!

If you can&#x27;t grasp that, it&#x27;s not our (David and me) problem.

Of course like many things, you have to believe in it, otherwise it 
won&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s why Bob only got 16 out of 50 with the same 
strategy that allowed David to get 76 out of 100. At least that&#x27;s my 
explanation as ESP novice, David please correct if it&#x27;s wrong.

David, I&#x27;m very sorry about all this. I wish we had more mature folks 
here. But the way it is, I think maybe you better try your luck 
elsewhere.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hehe, great :-). And here&#x27;s now a faster video:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/oll49_fast.wmv

The twisting is 1.50 seconds, i.e. a bit more than twice as fast as 
yours. This does not include the regrip for the x at the end, with 
that it&#x27;s 1.77 seconds.

I had also found another nice way for this OLL case:
R&#x27; U&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R

This might actually be faster for me, but I noticed I get confused and 
make mistakes because I&#x27;m using this alg for your case 23:
R&#x27; U&#x27; F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R

That&#x27;s the same but without a (R&#x27; F&#x27; R F) in the middle. You&#x27;re using 
the same alg, just from a different angle:
(L&#x27; d&#x27;) (R d) (L U&#x27;) (r&#x27; U&#x27; r)

Adding (B&#x27; R&#x27; B R) at the appropriate place gives you this alternative 
alg for case 49:
(L&#x27; d&#x27;) (R (B&#x27; R&#x27; B R) d) (L U&#x27;) (r&#x27; U&#x27; r)

Since you do your OLL 23 in 1.60 and your OLL 49 in 3.10, all you have 
to do is those extra four moves in less than 1.50 ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

25 years ago, when I was a young cuber, I bought a solution poster <br>
and tacked it to the door of my room. <br>
<br>
My mom has been cleaning out the house, and for christmas took the <br>
old poster off the door, patched it up, laminated it and mailed it <br>
to me!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s an interesting solution - edges first (top layer edges, middle <br>
layer edges, bottom edge permute then orient), then corners (place <br>
front, place back, orient right, orient left). The solution is <br>
entirely built from commutators, using certain commutators for <br>
different steps.<br>
<br>
The solution is credited to: &quot;Jeffrey Adams, who has a PhD in <br>
mathematics (Lie Groups) from Yale University&quot; with &quot;Many thanks are <br>
owed to Matthew and Tevin Abeshouse, who did the design and graphics <br>
for this poster, and to Don Kersey, with whom most of this material <br>
was discovered.&quot;<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll bring it along to the Exploratorium contest and maybe we can <br>

For me, I seem to be averaging around 200ms, with a fastest of 180-
something. I lasted until I had to react in 200ms - just a tad too 
slow on that one. The trick seems to be figuring out how to react to 
the sight, not the sound - I never did figure out quite what the 
visual cue was.

Not bad for a nearly-40-year-old.

Anyway, to bring this to cubing, do you think a fast reaction time 
helps with case recognition while solving the cube?  Generally, we 
should be looking ahead so that we know what&#x27;s coming... but sometimes 
you do a really fast OLL and you&#x27;re hit with a 3-cycle that&#x27;s facing 
right at you with the correct face.  Is it costing us 200 ms to decide 
clockwise or counter-clockwise, does it take more time than that 
because we have to recognize something more complex?

          <div class="email-content">Hey folks<br>
   <br>
  Well, I know this is not very fast, many of you can average faster than this, but I&#x27;m happy to announce that I made my first sub-16s solve! The time was 15.78s, with this scramble:<br>
   <br>
  F&#x27; D F2 D2 R2 L U F2 D B R&#x27; L D L B U L U&#x27; L U&#x27; F&#x27; B2 L R F&#x27;<br>
   <br>
  My solution was like this:<br>
  Cross: (y&#x27;) F&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; (5)<br>
  1st pair: (y) U L&#x27; U L U (y) L&#x27; U L (8)<br>
  2nd pair: (y2) R U&#x27; R&#x27; (y) U&#x27; L&#x27; U L (7)<br>
  3rd pair: (y) L&#x27; U2 L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L (7)<br>
  4th pair: U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; (4)<br>
  OLL: (y&#x27;) R U x&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U x U&#x27; R&#x27; (8)<br>
  PLL: (U) R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27; (14)<br>
   <br>
  Total: 53 moves in 15.78 seconds = ~3.36moves/second<br>
   <br>
  I know, I know, too many cube rotations...I have to work on that...but that slve was GOOD! : )<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think so. On that game, you just have to see the bullet or hear the sound and click the mouse. On cubing, you have to see a pattern (between A LOT of them) and decide which alg to use (that also is not just one move). But I think people with good reflexes are good on cubing.

  I think the people with ridiculous scores cheat.

Anyway, to bring this to cubing, do you think a fast reaction time 
helps with case recognition while solving the cube?  Generally, we 
should be looking ahead so that we know what&#x27;s coming... but sometimes 
you do a really fast OLL and you&#x27;re hit with a 3-cycle that&#x27;s facing 
right at you with the correct face.  Is it costing us 200 ms to decide 
clockwise or counter-clockwise, does it take more time than that 
because we have to recognize something more complex?

My average was about 165 ms, with a best of 142.  I made it to level
11 or 12.  I lost by 1 ms. D:

It&#x27;s intersting that there are so many vatiations of M2

rR&#x27; rR&#x27;

r2 R2&#x27;

M&#x27; M&#x27; (with ring finger)

M2&#x27; (with ring and middle)

L(LM2)

r(R&#x27;M&#x27;)

I have used all of the above mentioned methods for M2, pretty much in
the order described.  The way I do it is very close to your way.  But
instead of doing L, I do r, bringing the UB edge down to DB.  Then I
just do a M&#x27; with my left ring finger as do R&#x27; with my Right hand. 
Everything is the same way as what you described, but I push my right
hand away instead of bringing my left hand toward me.  

Happy Cubing

So if you&#x27;re after the 3x3 world record, I suggest you put down the 
cube and stop the timer right after OLL! This will work in 1 out of 
288 cases, not bad! You can use this in official competitions, and if 
you declare this to be your standard method, you can even use it for 
the UWR lists, since you&#x27;re not skipping a step of your method.

Btw, for that bullet game your hardware matters. I got mostly under 
200 (and 157 best) when using a real mouse, and mostly over 300 when 
using the &quot;mouse button&quot; on my laptop itself (in front of the

Isn&#x27;t it 1/216?  And you&#x27;ll get a +2 penalty 75% of your successful
solves, too.

Oh, I have been using my mouse button on my laptop because I don&#x27;t
have a real mouse.  I put the volume on real loud, too, so that when I
get shot at, I get scared.

No, 216 is for OLL. For PLL it&#x27;s 288.

And hey... at RWC 2005 we had about 660 regular 3x3 solves. Assuming 
everybody used PLL as last step, there&#x27;s a 90% chance that at least 
once we had a complete PLL skip (i.e. not even an AUF necessary). Is 
anybody here who had this?

A bit late, but I thought I&#x27;d post it anyway.

I got 2 interesting puzzles for Xmas.

1. Poker Cube
   This cube had a sticker for each card in a deck.  9 facelets x 6
sides = 54 stickers.  13 cards x 4 suits + 2 jokers = 54 cards in a
deck.  IT comes with little dice, and instructions on how to play.  I
don&#x27;t think that it has a solved state, the cube is used in the game
to produce randomness.

2. K-Ball
  a very interesting spherical puzzle.  Its basically a 2x2; a sphere
divided into 8 parts, with colored rings on the surface of the sphere.
 The Interesting part is that each of the colors have different
Braille (spelling?) symbols. You can do this blindfolded with no
memorization, if you can recognize the symbols.

OFF TOPIC
Does anyone know Braille?
Does anyone know sign language



I have taken 1 semester of sign language.  It&#x27;s very interesting to learn.

Happy Cubing!

Jason Kovacic

All this simulation isn&#x27;t very much in the way of proof, is it?<br>
It&#x27;s much quicker (and more formal and not empirical) to use <br>
conditional probability to get the result.<br>
<br>
Initially, you select the correct door with probability 1/3.<br>
If you are correct, switching is guaranteed to fail, sticking is <br>
guaranteed to win.<br>
If you are incorrect, switching is guaranteed to succeed, sticking is <br>
guaranteed to fail.<br>
<br>
(Heuristically, in the less probable case switching fails and in the <br>
more probable case switching succeeds. We can be more formal as <br>
follows:)<br>
<br>
P(Win if switch)<br>
=P(Win if switch|first guess is correct)*P(first guess is correct)+P<br>
(Win if switch|first guess is incorrect)*P(first guess is incorrect)<br>

=P(Win if stick|first guess is correct))*P(first guess is correct)+P<br>

This is probably the highest possible value for that field in the DB
where the highscore data is stored.
My guess is that they somehow either triggered a bug in the program, or
managed to submit a too large score somehow.
 
Just my 2 cents.

p.s. I&#x27;m getting down to average times in the 120 - 130 ms range now. My
&quot;trick&quot; is to close my eyes and just listen for the sound. when I used
my eyes i was stuck around 160.

          <div class="email-content">I just redid it today and got a 152.64ms average and a best of 129ms:
165 177 180 148 129 141 167 141 130 145 156

Basically I try to rely on the image of the gun being fired instead of
the sound. Believe it or not but I then tried to do it blindfold I got
a 159.18ms average (with no score below 140ms).

Assuming your screen and speaker are 1 meter away of you, you lose 3ms
just for the sound to come to your ears. I also think that the brain
is much more reactive to image than sound. 

Just my 2 cents,

Sven

I believe it.  I relied only on the sound.  Maybe I should try with
the picture. :)

Yes i admit,  i had a craze for minesweeper all those yrs ago. It&#x27;s 
been almost 10 yrs now since i was really into it :D I got those 
best times on my own version of the game written in Salford Fortran 
running under DOS/DBOS ;-)

Have fun !

&gt;<br>
&gt;P(Win if switch)<br>

I wasn&#x27;t asking you to believe anything, except that I accurately

But, I guess you missed that parts where I repeatedly said the I don&#x27;t

If you were being professional about this yourself, you could, of
course, read Rhine yourself, and, rather than take his or anyone&#x27;s
word for it, you could run such tests yourself. That&#x27;s what science is
about, after all, not just mouthing off, cheering on those you believe.

Many of the subjects who participated in the experiments described in 
Mind-Reach are well-known figures today: Ingo Swann, Patrick Price, 
URI GELLER ...

>From randi.org:

Parapsychologists Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ, who studied Mr. Geller 
at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as Stanford Research 
International) were aware, in one instance at least, that they were 
being shown a magician&#x27;s trick by Geller. They described it in their 
book Mind Reach, where they said that they  

      had every confidence that Uri could do that trick [the blindfold 
drive] as well as any of the dozens of other magicians who do it.

      Targ and Puthoff issued a lengthy and quite positive scientific 
paper extolling the psychic abilities of Geller. Their protocols for 
this &quot;serious&quot; investigation of the powers claimed by Geller were 
described by Dr. Ray Hyman, who investigated the project on behalf of 
a U.S. funding agency, as &quot;sloppy and inadequate.&quot;

Well, on the other hand, you could have gotten 73 correct always 
switching using the very same doors and ititial guesses :)

Didn&#x27;t anyone try this??? Or was the &quot;playing stategy&quot; menu too

btw, if it isn&#x27;t clear, blanks are counted as a guess for the first

Bah, using % is a cheap trick to make it look larger.
I prefer 0.00000000000000000259697

I did know the formula, just didn&#x27;t think I have a tool good enough to 
handle these very large and very small numbers. I was wrong, actually 
even my pocket calculator easily can...

It&#x27;s btw close to the probability that a random scramble results in a

          <div class="email-content">Hi GameOfDeath,

Stefan and I fully understand that running a simulation is not a 
mathematical proof.  However, we have given a mathematical proof many 
times.  In fact, Stefan has given the exact same mathematical proof, 
which is why we&#x27;ve resorted to simulations in an attempt to convince 
people that the answer is in deed 2/3 winning probability when one 
switches doors.

You know... having 76 successes out of 100 is very nearly (order of 
magnitude) the probability of getting lucky on a Rubik&#x27;s Cube is it 
not?

Can you honestly say that you didn&#x27;t believe what you just quoted?

IIRC Randi was there at SRI for the Iri Geller trials himself. He went
over all of their procedures. He prides himself at being able to sniff
out fakery. He found nothing wrong. He himself found that SRI&#x27;s
experiment was neither sloppy nor inadequate.

I am not at all impressed that Randi quotes someone else describing
that SRI experiment as sloppy and inadequate, especially when he knows
better from his own experience.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I&#x27;m not even reading the text but I am a firm non-believer of 
pseudo-science.  Look David, we&#x27;ve outlined it very simply.  We do not 
believe your code was written correctly.  Please show us your code and 
if it does not contain errors, given that the probability of what you 
did was on the order of 10^-18, I will believe that you have ESP.  If 
you show us your code, and it does indeed play the Monty Hall game, and 
you managed to get 76 wins without switching the door, I&#x27;ll believe you 
have super-human powers.

Either that, or just play my game.  If you put in $4, and I put in $5, 
and out of 100 times you win 76 times, you win $468.  That&#x27;s a lot of 
money.

With regards to ESP and all the arguments concerning time intervals and 
variations of the human mind, you are now simply deviating tremendously 
from your original statement that the probability of winning is 1/2 if 
one does not switch the door.  Your unwillingness to take up Stefan or 
my offers in this manner shows us a lack of confidence you have in your 
answer.  Or would you care to make a counter offer?  Did you play 
Charles&#x27; program?

With all of this said, I know this topic has strayed very far from 
Rubik&#x27;s Cube, so I&#x27;m going to bring it back to the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  If 
people are going to make claims, they should be willing to prove it.  
Creating a situation, such as this one, where things cannot be proven 
is not an excuse.  In the case where something cannot be proven, we 
have no reason to believe it.  No one can prove super-human powers, or 
ESP, or even religion for that matter, and so, the cubing community 
will not accept these reasons as excuses for whatever situation may 
arise.

If you claim there are unicorns, it&#x27;s your responsibility to prove to 
me that there&#x27;s a unicorn.  It&#x27;s not my fault that I can&#x27;t find a 
unicorn, and then you use that result to say that I can&#x27;t disprove it, 
and therefore it&#x27;s true.  That&#x27;s a logical fallacy.

So, if you&#x27;re going to post an unofficial world record, don&#x27;t create a 
situation where you&#x27;ll never be able to reproduce it, or you&#x27;ll never 
be able to prove yourself.  What if Macky started posting 11 second 
averages and then claimed, &quot;I only have magical abilities on the cube 
when no one else is watching.  Otherwise I get nervous.  Oh, and if you 
film it, I get nervous too.&quot;  Then how in the world are we supposed to 
verify it?

If something cannot be proven, no one is going to give you the benefit 
of the doubt.

That I&#x27;ve wasted way too much time on this already. You said I should 
not believe everything I read. And I don&#x27;t, I judge for myself. So 
does everybody here (hint: now would be a good time again to say your 
usual friendly &quot;if you&#x27;re idiots that&#x27;s not my problem&quot;... and then 
actually act like it&#x27;s really not a problem for you).

by hundreds. It might be helpful for people who want to get into big
cubing.

Bob: No, I ddidnt cube for the full 83 hours. I thing i would start at
around noon everyday, work until around 2 am, then do the same thing
the next day. So I guess i actually solved for only about 42 hours,
maybe a little more. But that was still very stressful, waking up and
staring at the screen for 14 hours! (yes, i did take a few breaks :P)

Thanks for the support!

I guess I only read some of the posts. In that case, I take it back 
(about people using simulations instead of proofs) and instead 
congratulate you both for presenting proofs.

I don&#x27;t know what the probability of getting lucky on a Rubik&#x27;s cube 
is. (Are you talking about the Revenge - with the probability being 
75% that one can skip one of the two non-standard 3x3x3 situations.)

In fact, I don&#x27;t even know the probablitiy of getting lucky. : )

I guess one must have

P(Getting lucky on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)=
P(Getting lucky|one is on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)=
[P(Getting lucky)-P(Getting lucky|one is not on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)*P(One 
is not being on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)]/P(One is on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)

at least assuming P(One is on a Rubik&#x27;s cube)>0.

Yeah, you&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m not a blind man but now I still say &quot;I&#x27;m done.

Now I&#x27;m more confused! I must be misunderstanding you because I 
thought you were talking a probability of c. 0.76 which seems very 
high for randomly solving.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;m no expert on megaminx, but it sounds to me like u got a bad 
specimen with some production error. Something like badly molded parts 
or an axis is not straight. But i&#x27;m really only guessing :-o Lubing 
and loosening the screws should have worked. Have u tried, btw, to see 
if there are molding imperfections that u can remove from any of the 
parts? If there is, use a sharp knife or sanding paper to remove it :-)

Good luck! :-)

Hey Stefan!

Did you also try the M2 trick for the H permutation?

          <div class="email-content">Hello guys,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve always been a very crap algorithms performer.<br>
Even if my best average is 17.92, I still average over 7 seconds for<br>
the LL (sometimes over 8 or 9 !).<br>
I&#x27;ve timed all my PLL algorithms and took averages.<br>
The result is 3.28 seconds (for PLL only) (weighted average, knowing<br>
that the solved case time is 0 seconds).<br>
All my PLL were timed the same way : hands on the stackmat, sitting at a table.<br>
<br>
Here are the full results : http://www.belgiancubes.be/LL_average.pdf<br>
I&#x27;m first going to work on the over4 seconds cases, and the ones that<br>
add more than 0.2 seconds to the average.<br>
This will take me to a 3.16 average for PLL, and then I&#x27;ll take down<br>
all my over3.5 and over 0.17 weighted, and so on.<br>
My goal is 2.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I&#x27;ll do the same for OLL.<br>
I thought I would share this with you if any of you is in the same case as I am.<br>
I think that after this work I should be able to have a 16 seconds<br>
average. :D (then I&#x27;ll work again on F2L also).<br>
<br>
Happy New Year !<br>

Yes of course. But there I haven&#x27;t decided yet whether I like Bob&#x27;s or 
your way better. What annoys me about this alg is that I&#x27;m not able to 
do the U2 nicely, usually I do that in one motion with my right index 
finger, but that doesn&#x27;t fit in here for me. And I need my right 
middle finger for holding the cube, so I can&#x27;t do index+middle. 
Instead, I do U twice with index finger.

The four-edge-flip alg is now one of my favourite algs. It feels very 
nice, and the best thing is that both at start and end, I have the 
standard grip. And I both start and end with r&#x27;. So I can do it 
endlessly without stop, and I did that (repeating the alg for maybe 15 
minutes) last night. I also did it while reading some new posts, and 
sometimes when I looked back at the cube I thought &quot;oh damn you made a 
mistake&quot; but then a moment later my hands had restored it again. Well, 
of course I only saw it *pass* the solved state, cause my hands don&#x27;t 
know when to break (since there&#x27;s no stop between two executions). It 
feels so natural... it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m just holding the cube and wiggle L 
and R a bit back and forth, just throwing in some index finger pulling 
at times.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah, that&#x27;s absolutely normal. The problem are the way too strong and 
long springs. I&#x27;ve replaced them with softer and shorter ones (and 
added more washers to make up for the length and to adjust the tension 
like I wanted it).

Thanks, where did you find the new springs?  And just how loose should<br>
the puzzle be when i&#x27;m finished with it to optimize it for speed solving?<br>

(P.S.  Seems like it would make more sense for mefferts to just go<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Sadly, most manufacturers don&#x27;t seem to care too much about quality. 
They will just say: but the puzzle works doesn&#x27;t it? Or: if u are a 
speeder u need to prepare it urself! 

Well, i think stefan might be able to send u some new springs. He 
bought ****loads of them before ;-)

Have fun!

That&#x27;s right, I bought 450 of a good type. But I only have very few 
left at the moment. I want to buy more again soon, then I can sell 
some. I&#x27;ll also try to find real good washers and also screws for 
Studio 3x3s and equivalent. But I&#x27;ve been saying this a long time 
already so... oh well, maybe next week.

For tension, it&#x27;s your own preference. I described how deep I have my 
screws here:

Can you tell where you got them, how many you bought and how much you 
paid?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bob,

Well, in defense of blindfold, you don&#x27;t think it should be an &quot;average 
of&quot; event because right now the standards are very low.  People aren&#x27;t 
expected to complete every solve in blindfold with 100% accuracy, but I 
do believe that it will be possible in the near future.  Leyan is 
pulling off 12 solves in a row with a 2:14 average, I&#x27;m sure the rest 
of us can do 5.
