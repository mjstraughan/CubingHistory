        I have a few of each, and in each case the Studio 4x4x4 is looser than a
        Winning Moves 4x4x4. However the appearance is identical, including the
        stickers. So it makes me think they are not made in the same place as
        the Studio 3x3x3. Maybe they are just assembled in a different factory,
        where the adjustments are made differently, hence the different feel.

        No, there is only one face to turn, and of course you can't change the

        is there anyone else out there there that uses the petrus method that
        could give me some pointers that might help me break the 30 limit. im

        cuber &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I
        used to play with the cube in the &gt;&gt; &gt; 80's when I was little(I
        used a really simple beginner layer method, I &gt;&gt; &gt; think) and
        recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in the office &gt;&gt; &gt;
        had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August. &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the people here's web pages and
        they have &gt;&gt; &gt; all been a great help (esp. Jessica Fridrich's,
        Dan Harris', Joel Van &gt;&gt; &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks
        to everyone for making some great &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the
        cross on the bottom. I am getting better at doing &gt;&gt; &gt; F2L
        (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast decisions &gt;&gt; &gt;
        though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL algorithms (and
        &gt;&gt; &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to try to
        learn all the &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is
        that the general approach &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I
        learnt those PLL's I have found it &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to solve the
        cube in around 50 seconds whereas before it was &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1
        minute 30 or something like that if I went flat out. Still &gt;&gt; &gt;
        pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked
        &gt;&gt; &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31
        seconds. &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :)
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a
        department store in August with &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers on (which
        deteriorated really rapidly )- probably the &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3
        Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube with PVC &gt;&gt; &gt;
        stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to control
        &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves (although
        it's &gt;&gt; &gt; noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has
        M0105B written on &gt;&gt; &gt; one of the corners. &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube?
        Is it the &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different
        centre white sticker? Is &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all suitable for
        speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt; polypropelene? &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; That's it for now. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers,
        Matt &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        hello mr washyourmonkey i used the petrus method for about a year. i
        recently jumped ship to fridrich (about 3 months ago) and i'm already
        doing faster times. in fairness this could be partly because there are
        certain aspects of the petrus method that i never really got the hang
        off; in particular colour neutrality. however, i did achieve a best time
        of 23.5x and an average fractionally under 30 albeit not in competition
        :-(, albeit that's not much quiker than you anyway here are a couple of
        things that you might want to consider that improved my times 1. switch
        to oll/pll for the last layer. and find some decent algorithms that suit
        you. the good thing about petrus is that, with edges flipped correctly
        on the last layer the burden of oll is vastly reduced. a further benefit
        is that, if you do want to switch methods in the future, you're half way
        there. 2. step 4 algorithms. spend some time with the wonderful
        cubesolver (http://www.speedcubing.com/CubeSolver/CubeSolver.html) and
        learn some optimal algs for the positions, especially for the last
        corner-edge pair. i used to burn a lot of moves in this stage. 3. find
        algorithms that suit your style. i used/misused a few algs from the
        petrus site for the last layer that didn't really suit my style. take
        advantage of the considerable amount of work that has been done on the
        fridrich based solution and learn some nicer algs. 4. find the 'leaks'.
        do some slow solves and note where your method is inefficient. then work
        on these areas using cubesolver/acube. 5. consider joining duncan dicks
        on his l2l2 quest. the petrus 2x3x3 is a good starting point for this
        promising method and i've generated the algorithms in acube if you're
        interested in taking this on. unfortunately i got a bit bogged down in
        algorithm learning and then fell for f2l pairs :-) cheers paul --- In

        &gt; You can probably find them on ebay once in a while but they go for
        &gt; high prices like $50 or so. Yeah they have solid corners. Depends
        on how you define "solid". They are closed with caps, but they are
        hollow inside. Cheers! Stefan

        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I used
        to play with the &gt; &gt; cube in the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 80's when
        I was little(I used a really simple beginner &gt; &gt; layer method, I
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4
        someone in &gt; &gt; the office &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had got hooked
        again and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the people here's web pages and
        &gt; &gt; they have &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all been a great help (esp.
        Jessica Fridrich's, Dan &gt; &gt; Harris', Joel Van &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making &gt;
        &gt; some great &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the
        bottom. I am getting &gt; &gt; better at doing &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast &gt; &gt; decisions
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F
        PLL &gt; &gt; algorithms (and &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have forgotten the
        A one!). I guess I'm going to try to &gt; &gt; learn all the &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the
        general &gt; &gt; approach &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich?
        Since I learnt those PLL's I have &gt; &gt; found it &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas &gt; &gt;
        before it was &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something
        like that if I went flat &gt; &gt; out. Still &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was
        &gt; &gt; shocked &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when using my method after a
        few tries I solved it in 31 &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a department
        store in &gt; &gt; August with &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers
        on (which deteriorated really rapidly )- &gt; &gt; probably the &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3
        DIY cube &gt; &gt; with PVC &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stickers which I
        prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to &gt; &gt; control &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves (although
        &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; noisier according to my wife). Oh
        yes, and it has M0105B &gt; &gt; written on &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one
        of the corners. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does
        anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? &gt; &gt; Is it
        the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a
        different centre white &gt; &gt; sticker? Is &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it
        at all suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt; &gt; &gt;
        polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's it
        for now. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers, Matt

        Sachin, the files section is the speedcubing group files section. The
        html file is there. You have to put the file on the same folder where

        Hi Thom, Unfortunately we all live miles away from each other! My best
        is still 29.xx average although now I'm using L2L2 full time I'm hoping
        that will come down. In the last few days and without too much practice
        my L2L2 average has come down to around 32-33 seconds. My 29.xx is L2L1
        and L2L2 is quite a bit more efficient so with a bit more practice I'm
        expecting better times. A friend of mine (John White) who used to be a
        speedcuber 20+ years ago lives up near you (liverpool) but he hasn't
        caught onto the revival. Pity - he was faster than me and also held the
        blindfold world record! best wishes Duncan ----- Original Message -----

        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It soudns like you are making good progress

        Dan a run for his money one day. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

        [Speed cubing group] New UK cuber &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I
        used to play with the &gt;&gt; &gt; cube in the &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; 80's when I was little(I used a really simple beginner &gt;&gt;
        &gt; layer method, I &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think) and recently
        after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in &gt;&gt; &gt; the office &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August.
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been
        reading a lot of the people here's web pages and &gt;&gt; &gt; they have
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all been a great help (esp. Jessica
        Fridrich's, Dan &gt;&gt; &gt; Harris', Joel Van &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making &gt;&gt;
        &gt; some great &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on
        the bottom. I am getting &gt;&gt; &gt; better at doing &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast
        &gt;&gt; &gt; decisions &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; though!) and have
        learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL &gt;&gt; &gt; algorithms (and
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm
        going to try to &gt;&gt; &gt; learn all the &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        PLL ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general &gt;&gt;
        &gt; approach &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I
        learnt those PLL's I have &gt;&gt; &gt; found it &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas &gt;&gt;
        &gt; before it was &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or
        something like that if I went flat &gt;&gt; &gt; out. Still &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris
        H's 'oh wow' scramble and was &gt;&gt; &gt; shocked &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31
        &gt;&gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a big
        Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in
        &gt;&gt; &gt; August with &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers on
        (which deteriorated really rapidly )- &gt;&gt; &gt; probably the
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's
        3 x 3 DIY cube &gt;&gt; &gt; with PVC &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to &gt;&gt; &gt;
        control &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing
        fast solves (although &gt;&gt; &gt; it's &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B &gt;&gt; &gt;
        written on &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one of the corners. &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions
        of the new anniversary cube? &gt;&gt; &gt; Is it the &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white
        &gt;&gt; &gt; sticker? Is &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all suitable
        for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        polypropelene? &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        That's it for now. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; Cheers, Matt &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        Jessica Fridrich's, Dan &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Harris', Joel Van &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to
        everyone for making &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some great &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; better at doing &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; F2L (it's
        taking a long time to be able to make fast &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; decisions
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H,
        E, J and F PLL &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; algorithms (and &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to try to
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; learn all the &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL
        ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; approach &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich?
        Since I learnt those PLL's I have &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; found it &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50
        seconds whereas &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; before it was &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out. Still &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty
        slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow'
        scramble and was &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shocked &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in 31 &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a
        big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a
        department store in &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; August with &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly )-
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; probably the &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic
        3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        with PVC &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The
        DIY one seems to be easier to &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; control &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves
        (although &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; written on &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one of the corners.
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does
        anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        Is it the &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the normal 3 x 3 but
        with a different centre white &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sticker? Is &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all suitable for speedcubing? Are the
        stickers PVC or &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; polypropelene? &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's it for now.
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi! A new cuber in the UK here. I used to
        play with the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cube in the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 80's when I was little(I used a really simple
        beginner &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; layer method, I &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the office &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        had got hooked again and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been
        reading a lot of the people here's web pages and &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        they have &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all been a great help

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So
        thanks to everyone for making &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some great &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the

        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; algorithms (and &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        have forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to try to &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; learn all the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL
        ones and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; approach &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning
        Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        found it &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to solve the
        cube in around 50 seconds whereas &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; before it was
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something
        like that if I went flat &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out. Still &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; shocked &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when using
        my method after a few tries I solved it in 31 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a big Oh
        wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a
        department store in &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; August with &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated
        really rapidly )- &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; probably the &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's
        3 x 3 DIY cube &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with PVC &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier to
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; control &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves (although &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; noisier

        written on &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one of the corners.

        &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Is it the &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same
        as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; sticker? Is &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all
        suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi there, I'm based in Bristol so sounds like we're close... I like the
        idea of meeting up at some point since no-one I know is into it at all
        so it's a lonely process learning it from the web. And slow, too!
        Finding time to do this will be pretty hard I have to say. I'm a bit
        older than most of the people here and have a young family! Anything's
        possible I suppose. If it's in Gloucestershire it will be easier! No
        chance of getting anywhere near Dan no matter how much I practice, I
        think but it will be fun trying! My problem is I keep forgetting the
        algorithms I never use and my fingers aren't as fast as they used to be.
        If I could consistently get near 30 I would be more than happy! Don't
        quite understand what the L2L(1-4) method refers to.. is it layers or
        number of times you look or...? Is it Fridrich at all? Cheers, Matt ---

        cubing group] New UK cuber &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! A new
        cuber in the UK here. I used to play with the cube in the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        80's when I was little(I used a really simple beginner layer method, I
        &gt; &gt; &gt; think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone in
        the office &gt; &gt; &gt; had got hooked again and bought a new cube in
        August. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the
        people here's web pages and they have &gt; &gt; &gt; all been a great
        help (esp. Jessica Fridrich's, Dan Harris', Joel Van &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to everyone for making some great
        &gt; &gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting
        better at doing &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able
        to make fast decisions &gt; &gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z,
        H, E, J and F PLL algorithms (and &gt; &gt; &gt; have forgotten the A
        one!). I guess I'm going to try to learn all the &gt; &gt; &gt; PLL ones
        and then look at the OLL ones. Is that the general approach &gt; &gt;
        &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have found it
        &gt; &gt; &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas
        before it was &gt; &gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that
        if I went flat out. Still &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty slow compared to
        everyone here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with
        Chris H's 'oh wow' scramble and was shocked &gt; &gt; &gt; when using my
        method after a few tries I solved it in 31 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; Well,
        That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        have two cubes, one I bought from a department store in August with &gt;
        &gt; &gt; bright stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly )-
        probably the &gt; &gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell, and a Rubik's
        3 x 3 DIY cube with PVC &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY
        one seems to be easier to control &gt; &gt; &gt; turns on and more
        suitable for doing fast solves (although it's &gt; &gt; &gt; noisier
        according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B written on &gt; &gt;
        &gt; one of the corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have
        any opinions of the new anniversary cube? Is it the &gt; &gt; &gt; same
        as the normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white sticker? Is &gt;
        &gt; &gt; it at all suitable for speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or
        &gt; polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's it for now.

        Unfortunately we all live miles away from each other! &gt;&gt; My best
        is still 29.xx average although now I'm using L2L2 full time &gt; I'm
        &gt;&gt; hoping that will come down. In the last few days and without
        too much &gt;&gt; practice my L2L2 average has come down to around 32-33
        seconds. My &gt; 29.xx is &gt;&gt; L2L1 and L2L2 is quite a bit more
        efficient so with a bit more &gt; practice I'm &gt;&gt; expecting better
        times. &gt;&gt; A friend of mine (John White) who used to be a
        speedcuber 20+ years ago &gt;&gt; lives up near you (liverpool) but he

        the office &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had got hooked again and
        bought a new cube in August. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the
        people here's web pages and &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they have &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all been a great help (esp. Jessica
        Fridrich's, Dan &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Harris', Joel Van &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So thanks to
        everyone for making &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some great &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; better at doing &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; F2L (it's taking a long time to be able to make fast &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; decisions &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; though!)
        and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F PLL &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        algorithms (and &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have forgotten the
        A one!). I guess I'm going to try to &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; learn all
        the &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at the
        OLL ones. Is that the general &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approach &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those
        PLL's I have &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; found it &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to solve the cube in around 50 seconds whereas
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; before it was &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I went flat &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; out. Still &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty
        slow compared to everyone here. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris H's
        'oh wow' scramble and was &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shocked &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when using my method after a few tries I
        solved it in 31 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; seconds. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a big Oh wow for me, anyway! :) &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have
        two cubes, one I bought from a department store in &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; August with &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bright stickers on
        (which deteriorated really rapidly )- &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; probably
        the &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell,
        and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY cube &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with PVC &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems
        to be easier to &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; control &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and more suitable for doing fast solves (although
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it's &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; noisier
        according to my wife). Oh yes, and it has M0105B &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        written on &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one of the corners.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary cube? &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; Is it the &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the
        normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre white &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        sticker? Is &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all suitable for
        speedcubing? Are the stickers PVC or &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        polypropelene? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's it for now. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        Hi Matt, I'm also older than most people here and with kids. I'm in
        Stroud though occasionally have jobs in Bristol. The L2L strategies are
        my method and can be found on
        http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle Its not a great
        website I'm afraid :( L2L refers to Last 2 Layers as opposed to Fridrich
        and First 2 Layers. The method avoids or significantly buts down the
        last layer element of Fridrich by doing parts of the last layer while
        putting in middle layer edges. Its a little more efficient on moves than
        Fridrich and requires fewer algorithms to learn. However the Fridrich
        algorithms have been optimised by many people for speed of execution and
        my L2L ones haven't. Still in principle its easier to learn and faster.
        best wishes Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "mantawrays"

        there, &gt; &gt; I'm based in Bristol so sounds like we're close... &gt;
        &gt; I like the idea of meeting up at some point since no-one I know is
        &gt; into it at all so it's a lonely process learning it from the web.
        And &gt; slow, too! &gt; &gt; Finding time to do this will be pretty
        hard I have to say. I'm a bit &gt; older than most of the people here
        and have a young family! Anything's &gt; possible I suppose. If it's in
        Gloucestershire it will be easier! &gt; &gt; No chance of getting
        anywhere near Dan no matter how much I practice, &gt; I think but it
        will be fun trying! My problem is I keep forgetting the &gt; algorithms
        I never use and my fingers aren't as fast as they used to &gt; be. If I
        could consistently get near 30 I would be more than happy! &gt; &gt;
        Don't quite understand what the L2L(1-4) method refers to.. is it &gt;
        layers or number of times you look or...? Is it Fridrich at all? &gt;

        Hi Duncan, Does it mean that you now have all the sequences needed for
        the L2L in 4 steps? On your site, I can't see the ones with the unsolved
        middle-layer edge not in the last layer. Gilles. --- In

        Hi Gilles, A good point Gilles. The way things are at the moment there
        are alternative algorithms in step 1 that will kick other middle layer
        edges down into the last layer. That takes care of all the cases except
        the one where all the middle layer edges start in the middle layer but
        jumbled. The reason I haven't spent time on this is because practically
        I do L2L2 and use other tricks instead of F2l pairs to make sure it
        doesn't happen. Its been a year since I first put up my website though
        so I am running out of excuses! If the method is ever going to be as
        practical as other fast strategies like your own, Fridrich and Petrus
        for example I need to upgrade the website and make sure it copes with
        every case. When I do this I will make sure that the most optimal (L2L3)
        solution goes up too. Thanks for pointing out my overenthusiasm! Duncan

        Well, the theory says that many more sequences are required. But, for
        example, chances for having the 4 middle-layer edges in the middle-layer
        when starting step 1 are very low ((1x2x3x4)/(5x6x7x8)). But for other
        steps, figures are much higher (1/15 for step 3, 1/5 for step 4). I
        didn't know if you had some strategy to reduce the number of cases, as
        some people do with Fridrich's last pair to reduce the complexity of the
        last layer. Gilles. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        my petrus times have dropped pretty steadily over the last year and i'm
        averaging 27 or so right now with it. if you want to see a video check
        out strangepuzzle.com i have a 22.18, and lars has a couple faster than
        that, a 14 and 18 if i remember correctly. color neutrality is a big
        deal because it makes almost every scramble have a decent start, i found
        my biggest "leak" was in the edge flipping stage, when it was red/yellow
        or red/white i could tear through it, while if it was blue/orange or
        something like that, i'd have problems seeing all the bad edges. the
        biggest thing to work on, or that i work on is still assembling that
        first 2x2x2 box. i study the cube until i memorize the box moves, then
        put on a blindfold, or close my eyes and do it. this really helps the
        ability to look ahead which is extra crucial for the petrus. lars also
        recommended to me, that you should write down a box solution for every
        corner on a scramble, and decide which one is best, it takes some time
        but its a great exercise. i'm not sure who all uses the petrus method
        out there, but thaese are my ideas. ----- Original Message ---- From:

        First off, I can't find a printout for the master magic that is actually
        silver. If anyone could point me out where I could print silver colored
        paper "inserts" for the master magic, that would be great. Second off,
        in this printout (which is black :^( )

        I cannot tell if on the third page (which has the backside), has the
        magic been flipped left to right, or top to bottom. It would be very bad
        if I did it the wrong way around :p

        I've been messing around with Petrus/RH start where I don't orient the
        edges before I finish f2l. With an OLL/PLL finish I've been averaging

        For a while I wanted to know how many sune variant applications I need
        to solve OLL. Let's say standard sune is (R U R' U R U2 R'). You can
        invert it, you can mirror it, and you can do an M' setup move which
        simply turns the first R into r and the last R' into r'. So you have 8
        sune variants of 7 moves each. Besides this large number of easy
        variants, I also like the sune for being a real simple algorithm (for
        beginners and for hands :-). So I finally wrote a program and got this
        result: 1 case needs 0 sunes. 6 cases need 1 sunes. 42 cases need 2
        sunes. 9 cases need 3 sunes. Average number of sunes needed: 2.01724
        Next idea would be to find out how many sunes are needed (max/avg) to
        solve the whole LL after corners have been permuted (because sunes don't
        change the relative corner permutation). Cheers! Stefan

        don't mirror but only invert and/or setup M', then this OLL case is the
        only one that needs four sunes, so this is somewhat the "hardest case"

        simple sequences like the Sune, can be powerful. Mixing and optimizing 2
        simple sequences give elegant solutions to complex last-layer cases,
        often QTM-optimal (that's why I often said I would choose this approach
        if I wanted to become a ZB-boy). Lars Petrus computed solutions for all
        last-layer cases with oriented edges, based on 2 simple sequences. He
        may have the answer to your question. Gilles.

        like &gt; the sune for being a real simple algorithm (for beginners and
        for &gt; hands :-). &gt; &gt; So I finally wrote a program and got this
        result: &gt; &gt; 1 case needs 0 sunes. &gt; 6 cases need 1 sunes. &gt;
        42 cases need 2 sunes. &gt; 9 cases need 3 sunes. &gt; Average number of
        sunes needed: 2.01724 &gt; &gt; Next idea would be to find out how many
        sunes are needed (max/avg) to &gt; solve the whole LL after corners have
        been permuted (because sunes &gt; don't change the relative corner
        permutation). &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan Hi Stefan, COLL never needs
        more than 2 sunes. Not that this info helps anything. Cheers, David J

        :-) Everybody *should*... That's a method I like for team solving. When
        it's time to orient corners, one person simply starts a sune and the
        other follows it blindly. As long as the guy starts correctly, it's
        fine. And it's fast and everybody knows it... I also uploaded my program
        here just in case anybody is interested in playing with it:

        Oh, I forgot: if someone could come up with some simple rules to
        actually use this as efficiently as the program showed is possible (i.
        e. how to know which sune to apply and where in order to minimize the
        number of sunes needed) then that would be great :-). So far I find it
        interesting in theory but it would be cool to have it useful in
        practice. For "COLL with up to 2 sunes" it's easy, if it's not solved
        already or doable with a single sune then you just need to create a case
        with three badly oriented corners, which is not hard. And the number of
        cases there are of course much smaller so you can just learn all of
        them. But finding out how to only flip four edges with 3 sunes took me a
        bit of time and I'd like to be able to see it instantly... Cheers!

        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi! A
        new cuber in the UK here. I used to play with the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube in
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 80's when I was little(I used a really
        simple beginner &gt; &gt; &gt; layer method, I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; think) and recently after playing with a 4 x 4 someone &gt; in &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the office &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; had got hooked again
        and bought a new cube in August. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've been reading a lot of the people here's web
        pages &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; they have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all
        been a great help (esp. Jessica Fridrich's, Dan &gt; &gt; &gt; Harris',
        Joel Van &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Noort, Chris Hardwick's). So
        thanks to everyone for &gt; making &gt; &gt; &gt; some great &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; webpages. I use the cross on the bottom. I am getting
        &gt; &gt; &gt; better at doing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; F2L (it's
        taking a long time to be able to make fast &gt; &gt; &gt; decisions &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; though!) and have learnt the U, Z, H, E, J and F
        PLL &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms (and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
        forgotten the A one!). I guess I'm going to try to &gt; &gt; &gt; learn
        all the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PLL ones and then look at the OLL
        ones. Is that the &gt; general &gt; &gt; &gt; approach &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; to learning Fridrich? Since I learnt those PLL's I have
        &gt; &gt; &gt; found it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possible to solve
        the cube in around 50 seconds whereas &gt; &gt; &gt; before it was &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 1 minute 30 or something like that if I
        went &gt; flat &gt; &gt; &gt; out. Still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        pretty slow compared to everyone here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Still, I had a go with Chris H's 'oh wow'
        scramble and &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; shocked &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; when using my method after a few tries I solved it in &gt; 31 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, That was a big Oh
        wow for me, anyway! :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; I have two cubes, one I bought from a department store
        &gt; in &gt; &gt; &gt; August with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bright
        stickers on (which deteriorated really rapidly &gt; )- &gt; &gt; &gt;
        probably the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; generic 3 x 3 Rubiks.com sell,
        and a Rubik's 3 x 3 DIY &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; with PVC &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; stickers which I prefer. The DIY one seems to be easier
        &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; control &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turns on and
        more suitable for doing fast solves &gt; (although &gt; &gt; &gt; it's
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; noisier according to my wife). Oh yes, and
        it has &gt; M0105B &gt; &gt; &gt; written on &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; one of the corners. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions of the new anniversary &gt;
        cube? &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same as the
        normal 3 x 3 but with a different centre &gt; white &gt; &gt; &gt;
        sticker? Is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it at all suitable for
        speedcubing? Are the stickers &gt; PVC or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        polypropelene? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

        I don't cube like I used to, but generally I try to clean my cubes
        before a competition. Not sure if I'm going to get around to doing that
        for San Francisco. I definitely had Dan Lo and Shelley in my room and we
        lubed up cubes assembly line style outside while polluting the small
        campus of Caltech with silicone fumes. If you use one cube and you cube
        a lot, maybe once every month or two? The thing I don't like is relubing
        a cube without replacing the stickers, but I guess eventually the stuff
        comes off the cube. (and onto your HANDS) Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Hello Everyone I usually wash my cubies in soapy water and then clean
        them w/ paper towels. Then spray silicone and reassemble. I know that
        it's unnecessary, but I probably do this twice a month. Sometimes once a
        week. The whole process is similar to changing the oil in a car. New
        lubricant, for moving mechanical parts. Jason --- In

        sub-15 times, too... I don't know if these advice help, but let's hope
        so: 1. Practice a lot doing the 2x2x2-box, you should try to do it in
        less than 8 moves. I guess I average something like 6 moves, but I'm not
        sure. 2. During the inspection time, you should be able to plan out a
        bit father than the 2x2x2, at least you should know which 2x2x3 you are
        going to build. Also practicing to do the whole 2x2x3-block blindfolded
        helps. 3. Don't always choose the fastest way to flip the edges in step
        3. I, for example, combine steps 3 and 4a quite often. 4. Learn some
        algs for the last pair, though this is not necessary. 5. For the LL, I
        highly recommend using OLL and PLL. At least I find it better than COLL
        and PLL. 6. Practice going for fewest moves, you may find useful
        shortcuts or other tricks. - Johannes

        I was just playing THPS4 and thought it'd be fun to apply it to cubing.
        Here's how it works; Basically, the aim of the game is to make the other
        person get all the letters and be out. The letters are usually HORSE.
        Firstly, You both scramble the same scramble, the person who goes first
        sets a time and the next person has to beat it, otherwise they get a
        letter. If the second person beats it, they both scramble again with the
        same scramble and have to set a faster time then the second person's.
        This carries on in a similar fashion until someone gets a letter. Then,
        the person who didn't get a letter goes first next time (this time you
        use a new scramble). and you carry on in this fashion until someone
        becomes a horse :P You can play with different words, too. (CUBE :) )

        Hello all. I was just curious whether anyone here is interestd in
        reverse engineering of softwares? I am a little bit into it right now
        and wanted to know if there are any fellow cubers out here who are also
        interested in this. Dont worry, its not always illegal...only when u
        crack commercial softwares is it considered illegal. It would be great
        if a fellow cuber also turns out to be a reverser, i would love to talk
        with him/her :) Also on other note, how many people here are into
        hardcore windows programming? I mean C programming with the api's and
        stuff? I would like to have a chat with u too if u do some windows
        programming. Still, Happy cubing, Sachin.

        &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; Hi Stefan, This is how I see them:
        Definitions for this page: CUbe rotations QU = y sune: R U R' U R U2 R'
        reverse sune: R U2 R' U' R U' R' LH (left handed) sune: L' U' L U' L' U2
        L reverse LH sune: L' U2 L U L' U L ** Symetrical position may be solved
        as mirror images. Here are my nicknames for the LL corner orientations
        and how to apply sunes. All Up: All the corners are upright. No sune
        needed. Three Down: Three corners are rotated clockwise or
        counterclockwise. Counterclockwise: Upright corner on FL: sune.
        CLockwise: Upright corner on BR: reverse sune. Headlights: Two corners
        are upright, two are rotated to face the same direction, like headlights
        on a car. Headlights face you: sune QU reverse sune. or sune QU2 LH
        sune. Sidelights: Two corners are upright, two are rotated to face away
        from each other. many different ways to do this Upright corners on the
        right, sune then left handed sune. or sune QU' reverse sune. or Upright
        corners in front: reverse sune QU sune. or reverse sune QU2 LH reverse
        sune. Oddlights: Two non-adjacent corners are upright, the other two are
        rotated. Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise and Left Front is
        rotated clockwise: sune QU2 reverse sune. Wheels: All four corners are
        rotated, two pairs face away from each other, like wheels on a car. The
        car is facing you the "Wheels" facing left and right: Sune twice. The
        car is facing left the "Wheels" facing front and back: Reverse sune
        twice. Barrow: All four corners are rotated, two face away from each
        other like wheels on the front of a wheel barrow, and two face the same
        direction like handles on a wheel barrow. The handles are in the back:
        sune QU sune. The handles are to the left: reverse sune LH sune. Put
        simply. (Once you know the names of the orientations) Sunes, done right
        handed or left handed, forwards or reversed, change a solved last level
        into the One Up Three Down orientation. In each case where two sunes are
        needed, after the first sune is applied you are left with the One Up
        Three Down orientation. There are 5 orientations needing two sunes -
        Headlights, Sidelights, Oddlights, Wheels, and Barrow. Application of
        first sune, R U R' U R U2 R': Headlights face you. Sidelights: Upright
        corners on the right. Oddlights: Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise
        and Left Front is rotated clockwise. Wheels: The car is facing you as if
        the "Wheels" are facing left and right. Barrow: The handles are in the
        back. Cheers, David J

        someone could come up with some simple rules to &gt; &gt; actually use

        how to know which sune to apply and where in order to minimize the &gt;
        &gt; number of sunes needed) then that would be great :-). So far I find
        it &gt; &gt; interesting in theory but it would be cool to have it
        useful in &gt; &gt; practice. For "COLL with up to 2 sunes" it's easy,
        if it's not solved &gt; &gt; already or doable with a single sune then
        you just need to create a &gt; &gt; case with three badly oriented
        corners, which is not hard. And the &gt; &gt; number of cases there are
        of course much smaller so you can just learn &gt; &gt; all of them. But
        finding out how to only flip four edges with 3 sunes &gt; &gt; took me a
        bit of time and I'd like to be able to see it instantly... &gt; &gt;

        Sakura from Fuji TV. Currently I am producing upcoming segment for our
        weekly live news show which will be air on 12/27 (TUE) from Time Warner
        Center at Columbus Circle (60th &amp; Columbus Ave). It is going to be
        our last episode for 2005 and we are introducing the best of 2005. I
        learned that you organize the event which happened this month at the
        Rutgers University, and I am wondering if you know some competitors. To
        complete our segment, we would like to have some competitors as
        professionals of Rubik's Cube. We would like to introduce the revival of
        rubik's cube this year, especially talk about the championship in
        Florida. We are looking forward to having a competitor from the world
        championship also. -We need you on 12/27(TUE) from 4pm-6pm -We would
        like you to solve the Rubik's cube It is a very short notice, but please
        understand that it took us for a while to reach you. Introducing you
        will be the highlight of our show, and we Do hope that your fellows will
        be able to participate our show. We will prepare you transportation in
        the case of strike. We would like to accommodate as much as possible to
        make this happen, please let us know if we can do anything for you. We
        have a great viewer ship in Japan and it is going to be a live news show
        like Good Morning America. You will be able to watch the channel on
        channel 63. also. Please let us know the possibility. Since I am on the
        deadline, I appreciate your response. I will try to reach you later
        today. Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. Below, I
        will attach the program information. Sincerely, Fuji TV Sakura Nakamura

        &gt; &gt; This is how I see them: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Definitions for
        this page: &gt; &gt; CUbe rotations QU = y &gt; &gt; sune: R U R' U R U2
        R' &gt; &gt; reverse sune: R U2 R' U' R U' R' &gt; &gt; LH (left handed)
        sune: L' U' L U' L' U2 L &gt; &gt; reverse LH sune: L' U2 L U L' U L
        &gt; &gt; ** &gt; &gt; Symetrical position may be solved as mirror
        images. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are my nicknames for the LL corner
        orientations and how to &gt; apply &gt; &gt; sunes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        All Up: All the corners are upright. &gt; &gt; No sune needed. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Three Down: Three corners are rotated clockwise or &gt;
        counterclockwise. &gt; &gt; Counterclockwise: Upright corner on FL:
        sune. &gt; &gt; CLockwise: Upright corner on BR: reverse sune. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Headlights: Two corners are upright, two are rotated to face
        the &gt; same &gt; &gt; direction, like headlights on a car. &gt; &gt;
        Headlights face you: sune QU reverse sune. &gt; &gt; or sune QU2 LH
        sune. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sidelights: Two corners are upright, two are
        rotated to face away &gt; from &gt; &gt; each other. &gt; &gt; many
        different ways to do this &gt; &gt; Upright corners on the right, sune
        then left handed sune. &gt; &gt; or sune QU' reverse sune. &gt; &gt; or
        &gt; &gt; Upright corners in front: reverse sune QU sune. &gt; &gt; or
        reverse sune QU2 LH reverse sune. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oddlights: Two
        non-adjacent corners are upright, the other two are &gt; &gt; rotated.
        &gt; &gt; Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise and Left Front is
        rotated &gt; &gt; clockwise: sune QU2 reverse sune. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Wheels: All four corners are rotated, two pairs face away from &gt; each
        &gt; &gt; other, like wheels on a car. &gt; &gt; The car is facing you
        the "Wheels" facing left and right: Sune &gt; twice. &gt; &gt; The car
        is facing left the "Wheels" facing front and back: Reverse &gt; &gt;
        sune twice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barrow: All four corners are rotated,
        two face away from each other &gt; &gt; like wheels on the front of a
        wheel barrow, and two face the same &gt; &gt; direction like handles on
        a wheel barrow. &gt; &gt; The handles are in the back: sune QU sune.
        &gt; &gt; The handles are to the left: reverse sune LH sune. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Put simply. (Once you know the names of the orientations) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Sunes, done right handed or left handed, forwards or
        reversed, &gt; change &gt; &gt; a solved last level into the One Up
        Three Down orientation. In each &gt; &gt; case where two sunes are
        needed, after the first sune is applied &gt; you &gt; &gt; are left with
        the One Up Three Down orientation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 5
        orientations needing two sunes - Headlights, &gt; Sidelights, &gt; &gt;
        Oddlights, Wheels, and Barrow. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Application of first
        sune, R U R' U R U2 R': &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Headlights face you. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Sidelights: Upright corners on the right. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Oddlights: Right Rear is rotated counterclockwise and Left Front
        &gt; is &gt; &gt; rotated clockwise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wheels: The car
        is facing you as if the "Wheels" are facing left &gt; and &gt; &gt;
        right. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barrow: The handles are in the back. &gt;

        Hi everyone! The FMC is back for Christmas! This year, similar to last
        year, we will have a special challenge over Christmas. This year there
        are a few more events, but the format is the same! You have to find the
        shortest solution for each category; you can take part in as many or as
        few events as you wish! The categories are: * Shortest solution to
        complete one face * Shortest solution to complete one layer (not a
        middle layer) * Shortest solution to any 1x2x3 block (a Roux block) *
        Shortest solution to 2 complete Roux blocks (Roux step 2.) * Shortest
        solution to any 2x2x2 block * Shortest solution to any 2x2x3 block *
        Shortest solution to the F2L * Shortest solution to solve all edges *
        Shortest solution to solve all corners * Shortest solution to the whole
        cube You have two weeks in which to submit your entries, and the
        competition details and the scramble can all be found at my website -
        www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt; and follow
        the FMC link. Good Luck everybody, let's make this challenge the biggest
        yet! DanH :) [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

        Hi Everyone, For all competitions in 2006, we will be making the
        following changes in the regulations: 1. No POPs will be allowed. The
        competitor will not be awarded an extra solve if there is a puzzle
        defect during the solve. 2. Record standards for 3x3x3 OH, 4x4x4, and
        5x5x5 will be Average of 5. The current world records set in the format
        of Mean of 3 will stand for six months to allow time for the current
        world record holders to retake their world records under the new format.
        Note: In blindfold cubing, +2 penalties are awarded. Thank you! Please
        let us know if there are any major objections. Tyson Mao World Cube

        Hi :-) I'm a bit ambivalent about not allowing pops anymore. Popping
        does happen rather often on the larger cubes (at least for me), and yes
        i can see that it's possible to force a pop and hence abuse it. But
        really i'd like to comment on changes NOT made. I think honestly that
        the rule saying that a twisted centre on a 5x5x5 cube is a DNF is far
        too strict. Can anyone explain the logic behind that
        rule/interpretation, cause i cannot with my best will see it. I have
        posted about this before. There is no way a twisted centre can be
        abused. It only makes cubing slower, and there is no ambiguity as to
        whether the cube is solved. I also have a suggestion about putting the
        scrambled and solved cube a minimum distance from the sensors used to
        start and stop the time. This could prevent cheating. And finally i
        would like to see that stickers will be allowed for fewest moves
        competitions. Again i cannot see any reasons why not. It will be the
        competitors responsibility to provide own stickers and not to overrun on
        time (as always). The rules could say that stickers should be
        self-adhesive so that no tape will be needed or allowed to attach them
        to the cube. That's my 2 dollars ... lol ... Merry Christmas EVERYONE :D

        Hi Tyson, I really object to the idea of not allowing POP's. I'm not
        100% sure of the reasoning behind this rule, but I assume it's to
        prevent people from abusing it (ie when you have a bad solve you
        deliberately force a piece). But let's be honest, how many of the top20
        solvers in the world have ever needed to/wanted to commit this offence?
        Maybe I'm being ridiculously too trusting, but it just doesn't seem to
        be a problem as far as I can see. I really really can't see any of the
        top guys who can already solve in &lt;15 secs average being selfish
        enough to force the cube. And also, not allowing a POP could completely
        ruin a competitors chance of winning a title. A genuine POP is not the
        fault of the competitor at all, and yet the new rule would be punishing
        them, since it completely changes the approach to solving the cube. You
        don't want to risk anything, especially if your cube is not quite as
        stable as other competitors cubes. SO it also means that if you have a
        poorer cube you are less likely to have a chance of making 5 solves! AND
        of course, after you have POPped once, it's very unlikely that you could
        recover it and beat someone who hasn't POPped, if you didn't get the
        extra solve. I'm sorry for not putting my case very succinctly, but
        hopefully you can see I feel quite passionately about this rule change.
        I think the reasons for not changing the POP rule far outweigh the
        reason for changing it. As regards the other rules, especially making
        all averages out of 5, I am fully in favour of :) Per, Tyson, I am also
        in favour of allowing stickers in Fewest Moves Competitions. Just as
        speedcubers are allowed to use a variety of techniques, (some might use
        a corners first method, others might use Fridrich, and ChrisH might be
        using ZB), even though those who aren't using a particular technique
        might know nothing about it and not be able to use it in their solves.
        So not allowing stickers because it gives people an advantage over those
        who don't know how to use stickers to their advantage is not a valid
        reason I think (if that is indeed the reason for not allowing stickers,
        again i slightly assumed I think). If competitors would supply their own
        equipment, then I can't see any reason for not allowing stickers or
        sticker equivalents. Thanks for listening, DanH :) -

        Yeah, I agree with Dan and Per. Why not allowing POPs? Some people
        prefer flat centers, which gives more chance of poping...but...should
        they be punished by a personal preference? and if pops are not allowed,
        competitors will not push very hard on their solves, because they will
        be afraid of poping and ruining an average...so, we'll have slower
        times... well, is just what I think...but, I think POPs should be

        Yes, they should be punished because they can cut more corners. Please
        refer to Lars Petrus' argument. In order for a POP to affect your
        average, since the slowest solve is discarded, you have to pop twice, or
        twice out of five solves. 40% pop rate in a competition is unacceptable.

        force a piece). But let's be honest, how many of the &gt; top20 solvers
        in the world have ever needed to/wanted to commit this &gt; offence?
        Maybe I'm being ridiculously too trusting, but it just &gt; doesn't seem
        to be a problem as far as I can see. I really really &gt; can't see any
        of the top guys who can already solve in &lt;15 secs &gt; average being
        selfish enough to force the cube. And also, not &gt; allowing a POP
        could completely ruin a competitors chance of winning &gt; a title. A
        genuine POP is not the fault of the competitor at all, &gt; and yet the
        new rule would be punishing them, since it completely &gt; changes the
        approach to solving the cube. You don't want to risk &gt; anything,
        especially if your cube is not quite as stable as other &gt; competitors
        cubes. SO it also means that if you have a poorer cube &gt; you are less
        likely to have a chance of making 5 solves! AND of &gt; course, after
        you have POPped once, it's very unlikely that you &gt; could recover it
        and beat someone who hasn't POPped, if you didn't &gt; get the extra
        solve. I'm sorry for not putting my case very &gt; succinctly, but
        hopefully you can see I feel quite passionately &gt; about this rule
        change. I think the reasons for not changing the POP &gt; rule far
        outweigh the reason for changing it. &gt; &gt; As regards the other
        rules, especially making all averages out of 5, &gt; I am fully in
        favour of :) &gt; &gt; Per, Tyson, I am also in favour of allowing
        stickers in Fewest Moves &gt; Competitions. Just as speedcubers are
        allowed to use a variety of &gt; techniques, (some might use a corners
        first method, others might use &gt; Fridrich, and ChrisH might be using
        ZB), even though those who &gt; aren't using a particular technique
        might know nothing about it and &gt; not be able to use it in their
        solves. So not allowing stickers &gt; because it gives people an
        advantage over those who don't know how &gt; to use stickers to their
        advantage is not a valid reason I think (if &gt; that is indeed the
        reason for not allowing stickers, again i &gt; slightly assumed I
        think). If competitors would supply their own &gt; equipment, then I
        can't see any reason for not allowing stickers or &gt; sticker

        Hey Dan, It's not really about people forcing the cube in order to take
        advantage of eliminating a bad solve. Again, if someone pops in a
        competition, the time would probably be the slowest time of the five
        already anyway. Therefore, the time does not affect the average. Cubers
        are popping with less frequency these days anyway. So in order to be
        affected by the new rule, you have to pop twice. That's part of the
        reason why we move to average of 5 for more events. I actual disagree in
        that a genuine pop is, as I feel, the fault of the competitor. It
        results from inaccuracy of the turning. I see that someone could turn
        the cube really really fast, and if they're really good, and have good
        finger accuracy, there's no risk of popping at all. FMC I'll have to
        discuss with later as I'm about to take off. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Sure they should punished IF!!!!! they pop on purpose. but I do not
        think you can ever prove that. I therefore think that not allowing pops
        is completely wrong. Unless you can show me a VALID reason for not
        allowing pops then you should allow them. You should allow one pop per
        ten solves. Or something like that. While we are at it. When did you
        ever consult the cubing community at large about this, or did the board

        pop per ten solves. Or something like that. While we are at it. When did

        can cut more corners. Please refer to Lars Petrus' argument. In order
        for a POP to affect your average, since the slowest solve is discarded,
        you have to pop twice, or twice out of five solves. 40% pop rate in a

        prevent &gt; people from abusing it (ie when you have a bad solve you
        &gt; deliberately force a piece). But let's be honest, how many of the
        &gt; top20 solvers in the world have ever needed to/wanted to commit
        this &gt; offence? Maybe I'm being ridiculously too trusting, but it
        just &gt; doesn't seem to be a problem as far as I can see. I really
        really &gt; can't see any of the top guys who can already solve in
        &lt;15 secs &gt; average being selfish enough to force the cube. And
        also, not &gt; allowing a POP could completely ruin a competitors chance
        of winning &gt; a title. A genuine POP is not the fault of the
        competitor at all, &gt; and yet the new rule would be punishing them,
        since it completely &gt; changes the approach to solving the cube. You
        don't want to risk &gt; anything, especially if your cube is not quite
        as stable as other &gt; competitors cubes. SO it also means that if you
        have a poorer cube &gt; you are less likely to have a chance of making 5
        solves! AND of &gt; course, after you have POPped once, it's very
        unlikely that you &gt; could recover it and beat someone who hasn't
        POPped, if you didn't &gt; get the extra solve. I'm sorry for not
        putting my case very &gt; succinctly, but hopefully you can see I feel
        quite passionately &gt; about this rule change. I think the reasons for
        not changing the POP &gt; rule far outweigh the reason for changing it.
        &gt; &gt; As regards the other rules, especially making all averages out
        of 5, &gt; I am fully in favour of :) &gt; &gt; Per, Tyson, I am also in
        favour of allowing stickers in Fewest Moves &gt; Competitions. Just as
        speedcubers are allowed to use a variety of &gt; techniques, (some might
        use a corners first method, others might use &gt; Fridrich, and ChrisH
        might be using ZB), even though those who &gt; aren't using a particular
        technique might know nothing about it and &gt; not be able to use it in
        their solves. So not allowing stickers &gt; because it gives people an
        advantage over those who don't know how &gt; to use stickers to their
        advantage is not a valid reason I think (if &gt; that is indeed the

        Hi Dan, If popping is of no fault of the competitors, then logically one
        would award infinite number of pops no? On a less serious note, I think
        the elimination of popping will increase the amount of action during a
        competition. In cup stacking, (darn cups), if you knock over a stack,
        you have to fix it before you can proceed, which means if a cup flies
        off the table, into the audience, bounces of someone's head, lands in a
        suitcase, and ends up on a plane to Moldova, you better be ready to run
        through Eastern Europe. Just imagine the spectacular dives for pieces as
        Leyan pops (even though he never does), the piece flies through the air
        in the auditorium, he leaps off the stage, catches the piece, fixes it
        in midair, and then falls asleep in midair? A glorious day indeed! Tyson

        Hi Peter, It's something that's "up to the judge's discretion" and
        fortunately, we've never had to call people on it. As for the cubing
        community at large, we definitely had a discussion about this awhile ago
        when we were proposing changes. I don't remember when the discussion
        took place, but I'm sure someone can just search the archives. It has
        been largely stated that in order for a pop to affect an average of 5, a
        40% pop rate is necessary. That's like, a D- minus if you're in public
        school. And again, they should be punished, because popping is not just
        a result of a malicious attempt to get a better average an eliminate a
        bad solve, but it is also a result of the cuber's lack of ability to
        turn the cube accurately. Accuracy is very much a part of the solving
        practice as lightning quick fingers. You might want to look at some
        results and try calculating the placement if their pop was not allowed.
        I think for the most part, the standings remain unchanged. Tyson Mao MSC

        &gt; &gt; top20 solvers in the world have ever needed to/wanted to
        commit this &gt; &gt; offence? Maybe I'm being ridiculously too
        trusting, but it just &gt; &gt; doesn't seem to be a problem as far as I
        can see. I really really &gt; &gt; can't see any of the top guys who can
        already solve in &lt;15 secs &gt; &gt; average being selfish enough to
        force the cube. And also, not &gt; &gt; allowing a POP could completely
        ruin a competitors chance of winning &gt; &gt; a title. A genuine POP is
        not the fault of the competitor at all, &gt; &gt; and yet the new rule
        would be punishing them, since it completely &gt; &gt; changes the
        approach to solving the cube. You don't want to risk &gt; &gt; anything,
        especially if your cube is not quite as stable as other &gt; &gt;
        competitors cubes. SO it also means that if you have a poorer cube &gt;
        &gt; you are less likely to have a chance of making 5 solves! AND of
        &gt; &gt; course, after you have POPped once, it's very unlikely that
        you &gt; &gt; could recover it and beat someone who hasn't POPped, if
        you didn't &gt; &gt; get the extra solve. I'm sorry for not putting my
        case very &gt; &gt; succinctly, but hopefully you can see I feel quite
        passionately &gt; &gt; about this rule change. I think the reasons for
        not changing the POP &gt; &gt; rule far outweigh the reason for changing
        it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As regards the other rules, especially making
        all averages out of 5, &gt; &gt; I am fully in favour of :) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Per, Tyson, I am also in favour of allowing stickers in Fewest
        Moves &gt; &gt; Competitions. Just as speedcubers are allowed to use a
        variety of &gt; &gt; techniques, (some might use a corners first method,
        others might use &gt; &gt; Fridrich, and ChrisH might be using ZB), even
        though those who &gt; &gt; aren't using a particular technique might
        know nothing about it and &gt; &gt; not be able to use it in their
        solves. So not allowing stickers &gt; &gt; because it gives people an
        advantage over those who don't know how &gt; &gt; to use stickers to
        their advantage is not a valid reason I think (if &gt; &gt; that is
        indeed the reason for not allowing stickers, again i &gt; &gt; slightly
        assumed I think). If competitors would supply their own &gt; &gt;
        equipment, then I can't see any reason for not allowing stickers or &gt;
        &gt; sticker equivalents. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for listening, &gt;

        Haha, I remember that too. It was certainly most impressive. Macky was
        trying to do 12 solves without a pop because we thought about putting
        that type of record into the record books. (We've gotten rid of it...
        it's too long!) Anyway, he went into the competition saying that he
        wasn't going to pop at all, and the piece flies out, and we're all
        sitting behind the judge's table, Mark and I, and we're thinking to
        ourselves, what's he doing? Why didn't he take the pop? That was one
        midair leap short of a glorious day. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Hi Per, The cheating you're worried about, is this from a competitor
        manipulating the cube before starting the timer? I think the issue is
        generally taken care of if their hands and fingers are flat on the
        timing start sensors. I do remember a few close cases from various
        competitions such as WC where competitors tried to take as much
        advantage as they could. What distance do you recommend, and how are we
        to measure it? Just eyeball it? As for twisted center, I agree with you
        that it's not an advantage to solving the cube, but you see from a
        logistics stand point, if this is to be allowed, we have to torrid
        question of "how much" can something be twisted until it's not allowed
        anymore? I always feel that a cube needs to be solved and not "almost"
        solved. +2 is an issue that addresses "how much" and it can totally be
        argued that +2 is not necessary for normal solving. That might be
        something we address in 2007, but notice the principles of the +2 are
        less than 45 degrees, in other words, we're leaning towards something
        become completely solved as opposed to almost solved. What if a center
        piece is ejected from the cube? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute

        &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; I'm a bit ambivalent about not allowing pops

        least for me), and yes i &gt; can see that it's possible to force a pop
        and hence abuse it. &gt; &gt; But really i'd like to comment on changes
        NOT made. I think honestly &gt; that the rule saying that a twisted
        centre on a 5x5x5 cube is a DNF &gt; is far too strict. Can anyone
        explain the logic behind that &gt; rule/interpretation, cause i cannot
        with my best will see it. I have &gt; posted about this before. There is
        no way a twisted centre can be &gt; abused. It only makes cubing slower,
        and there is no ambiguity as to &gt; whether the cube is solved. &gt;
        &gt; I also have a suggestion about putting the scrambled and solved
        cube &gt; a minimum distance from the sensors used to start and stop the
        time. &gt; This could prevent cheating. &gt; &gt; And finally i would
        like to see that stickers will be allowed for &gt; fewest moves
        competitions. Again i cannot see any reasons why not. &gt; It will be
        the competitors responsibility to provide own stickers &gt; and not to
        overrun on time (as always). The rules could say that &gt; stickers

        of the cuber's lack of ability to &gt; turn the cube accurately.
        Accuracy is very much a part of the &gt; solving practice as lightning
        quick fingers. I agree and would like to add: - It's also a result of
        the cuber's lack of ability or willingness to prepare/use a non-popping
        cube. This is not WC 1982, you bring your own cube and you turn it
        yourself. So it's 100% your own fault if you pop it. - The *natural*
        thing is to solve the cube, period. The
        pop-and-you-can-try-again-for-free rule is artificial. So when we take
        it away, the poppers are *not* punished, they' just *not rewarded
        anymore*. Cheers! Stefan

        that the rule saying that a twisted centre on a 5x5x5 cube is a DNF &gt;
        is far too strict. Do you know which part of the rules was applied for
        that? And I agree it's a bit harsh. If I understand the situation
        correctly, it's just a center twisted a bit in place, right? That's much
        less unsolved than a twisted layer which is only punished +2. &gt; And
        finally i would like to see that stickers will be allowed for &gt;
        fewest moves competitions. Again i cannot see any reasons why not. Is it
        not allowed? All I can find about it is: "The competitor can use the
        following props: paper and pen (both supplied by judge), 3 cubes (self
        supplied). If the competitor uses other props, then he will be
        disqualified." So why don't you simply take the stickers of one cube and
        put them as markers onto the other cubes? Peeling off stickers is not
        covered anywhere in the rules as far as I see. Or you could use paper
        stickers on your cube and use the pen supplied by the judge to write
        marks onto them. If you're worried you'd get confused after a while
        because of too many marks, simply put ten stickers on each place instead
        of just one. I don't see a rule against that, either. Cheers! Stefan

        Hey parth, haven't heard from you or your brother for a while...but
        anyways... Opposite colour is when you can't see an easy cross on your
        main colour( we'll use red) and you see an easy cross on orange...you
        turn the cube so orange is the bottom and solve the cube with orange on
        bottom instead of red. It makes the cross faster...and can help with
        always having a good cross...with practice it becomes easy... Craig (I

        we were just wondering what motor would be good? logically, we were

        aren't sure about the numbers (like specific rpm and torque values)
        also, does anybody happen to have an estimate for how much it will cost
        to buy all the supplies necessary to build the most rudimentary cubing
        robot? (start out without color recognition....using manual input

        My family opens one gift on Christmas Eve, so we opened one tonight. I
        opened up the box and found a 5x3. Does anyone have any idea how to get

        shape :) I think once it has been returned to a rectangle, it can be
        solved like a 3x3. Any help would be appreciated because my dad said I

        Leyan, I've been meaning to ask how you apply your tiles. Do you do them
        one by one? They come in a template that makes it seem like you could
        apply all 16 at once (or 9 at once on the 3x3). But in reality that
        makes most of the tiles come out crooked. So I've resorted to one by
        one, centering each tile by hand. Your 4x4 looked so perfect I wondered
        if you had any tips, other than lots of patience? Chris --- In

        Ok, this is off topic, but is interesting... (please forgive if I make
        some mistake on the english...) Suppose you are at a TV show, where you
        have 3 doors. 1 of the doors has a car, and the other 2 don't have
        anything. So, the show presenter asks you to choose a door. So, you
        choose, but he doesn't open your choosen door. He opens an empty door.
        Then, he makes a question: do you want to continue with your first
        choice or change to the other door? What do you do? What situation gives
        you more chances of winning? Think about it... Pedro

        Hi all, Though I rarely pop, I disagree with not allowing pops. This
        means that faster cubers will have to focus more on not poping than they
        will on actually speeding. They will be much less likely to get a record
        average or time because they are worried about popping. Just my opinion.

        record books. (We've gotten rid &gt; of it... it's too long!) Anyway, he
        went into the competition saying &gt; that he wasn't going to pop at
        all, and the piece flies out, and we're &gt; all sitting behind the
        judge's table, Mark and I, and we're thinking to &gt; ourselves, what's
        he doing? Why didn't he take the pop? &gt; &gt; That was one midair leap

        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If popping is of no fault of the
        competitors, then logically one would &gt; &gt;&gt; award infinite
        number of pops no? On a less serious note, I think the &gt; &gt;&gt;
        elimination of popping will increase the amount of action during a &gt;
        &gt;&gt; competition. In cup stacking, (darn cups), if you knock over a
        stack, &gt; &gt;&gt; you have to fix it before you can proceed, which
        means if a cup flies &gt; &gt;&gt; off the table, into the audience,
        bounces of someone's head, lands in &gt; &gt;&gt; a &gt; &gt;&gt;
        suitcase, and ends up on a plane to Moldova, you better be ready to &gt;
        &gt;&gt; run &gt; &gt;&gt; through Eastern Europe. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; Just imagine the spectacular dives for pieces as Leyan pops
        (even &gt; &gt;&gt; though he never does), the piece flies through the
        air in the &gt; &gt;&gt; auditorium, he leaps off the stage, catches the
        piece, fixes it in &gt; &gt;&gt; midair, and then falls asleep in
        midair? &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A glorious day indeed! &gt; &gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I really object to the idea of not
        allowing POP's. I'm not 100% sure &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the reasoning
        behind this rule, but I assume it's to prevent &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people
        from abusing it (ie when you have a bad solve you &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        deliberately force a piece). But let's be honest, how many of the &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; top20 solvers in the world have ever needed to/wanted to
        commit this &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; offence? Maybe I'm being ridiculously too
        trusting, but it just &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't seem to be a problem as
        far as I can see. I really really &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can't see any of the
        top guys who can already solve in &lt;15 secs &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; average
        being selfish enough to force the cube. And also, not &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        allowing a POP could completely ruin a competitors chance of winning
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a title. A genuine POP is not the fault of the
        competitor at all, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and yet the new rule would be
        punishing them, since it completely &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; changes the
        approach to solving the cube. You don't want to risk &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        anything, especially if your cube is not quite as stable as other &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; competitors cubes. SO it also means that if you have a
        poorer cube &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you are less likely to have a chance of
        making 5 solves! AND of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; course, after you have POPped
        once, it's very unlikely that you &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; could recover it and
        beat someone who hasn't POPped, if you didn't &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; get the
        extra solve. I'm sorry for not putting my case very &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        succinctly, but hopefully you can see I feel quite passionately &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; about this rule change. I think the reasons for not
        changing the POP &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rule far outweigh the reason for
        changing it. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As regards the other
        rules, especially making all averages out of 5, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am
        fully in favour of :) &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Per, Tyson, I
        am also in favour of allowing stickers in Fewest Moves &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        Competitions. Just as speedcubers are allowed to use a variety of &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; techniques, (some might use a corners first method, others
        might use &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Fridrich, and ChrisH might be using ZB),
        even though those who &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; aren't using a particular
        technique might know nothing about it and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not be able
        to use it in their solves. So not allowing stickers &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        because it gives people an advantage over those who don't know how &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; to use stickers to their advantage is not a valid reason I
        think (if &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that is indeed the reason for not allowing
        stickers, again i &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; slightly assumed I think). If
        competitors would supply their own &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; equipment, then I
        can't see any reason for not allowing stickers or &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        sticker equivalents. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for

        Everyone, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For all

        changes &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the regulations: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. No POPs will be allowed. The competitor will
        not be awarded &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; an &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extra solve if
        there is a puzzle defect during the solve. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Record standards for 3x3x3 OH, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 will
        be &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Average of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. The current
        world records set in the format of Mean of 3 will &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        stand &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for six months to allow time for the current

        their world records under the new format. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        Hmm, lets see. You start with 3 doors, one with a car. The host cancels
        out a door giving you 2 doors. That means your guess has a 1/2 chance of
        being correct. There is no point in changing, its 50-50 no matter what.
        (unless the game is rigged where the car moves from one door to the next
        :P ) I would stay with my first choice, though it doesnt matter. Its all

        That's like saying that Nascar racers should be able to crash so that
        they can try to go even faster around the corners. It should DEFINITELY
        be the cuber's responsibility to keep his/her puzzle together while
        solving it. The Rubik's Cube does not fall apart by itself...it is the
        cuber's fault. I agree 100% that pops should count as a solve. I'm not
        the best cuber in the world...or even close, but I haven't popped my
        cube in over 6 months. -Chris On 12/24/05, pjgat09

        ahhh yes, the classic 3 door problem. I'd change to the other door of
        course and double my odds of winning. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I

        You pick the other door :) This is because when you first start, you
        have a 1/3 chance picking the correct door. After he has revealed an
        empty door. Your original choice still has a probability of 1/3 of being
        the correct door, the other door, however, now has a 1/2 probability of

        After you choose a door, the host has to open one. Two out of the three

        you stay with the door you first chose, you still have a 1/3 chance, if

        also might help if you think of 100 doors instead of 3. You choose one
        door, you have a 1/100 or 1% chance of being right. You stay with that
        door while the host opens 98 doors, so you are down to 2, the one you
        originally chose, and the last one that he hasn't open. Staying with
        your first choice, you still have a 1% chance. But if you switch, you
        have a 99% chance. There is a reason that he hasn't yet opened that
        door. By opening the other ones, he's giving you a clue about where the

        I would think this: You have a 1/3 chance of being right Host opens
        empty door Now lets assume that door has gone away. There are only 2
        doors, and you chose one. You still have a 1/2 chnace no matter what the
        host does. Opening a door didnt change your chances. Peter Greenwood ---

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you choose a door, the host has to open one.
        Two out of the three &gt; &gt; times, he has no choice which one to
        open. When you pick the door at &gt; &gt; first, &gt; &gt; you have a
        1/3 chance of being right. After he opens a door, if you stay &gt; &gt;
        with the door you first chose, you still have a 1/3 chance, if you
        switch, &gt; &gt; you have a 2/3 chance. There are three possibilities,
        considering you &gt; &gt; switch doors. &gt; &gt; 1) you were right at
        first, and you lose &gt; &gt; 2) you were wrong at first, and you win
        &gt; &gt; 3) you were wrong at first(other door), and you win &gt; &gt;
        Two out of the three possible outcomes, you win &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It
        also might help if you think of 100 doors instead of 3. &gt; &gt; You
        choose one door, you have a 1/100 or 1% chance of being right. You &gt;
        &gt; stay &gt; &gt; with that door while the host opens 98 doors, so you
        are down to 2, the &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; you originally chose, and the
        last one that he hasn't open. Staying with &gt; &gt; your first choice,
        you still have a 1% chance. But if you switch, you &gt; &gt; have &gt;
        &gt; a 99% chance. There is a reason that he hasn't yet opened that
        door. By &gt; &gt; opening the other ones, he's giving you a clue about
        where the car is. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and boy do I hope I'm right,
        because rereading that i sound really &gt; &gt; arrogant lol (really,

        Hmm, lets see. You start with 3 doors, one with a car. The host &gt;
        &gt; &gt; cancels out a door giving you 2 doors. That means your guess
        has a 1/2 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance of being correct. There is no point in
        changing, its 50-50 no &gt; &gt; &gt; matter what. (unless the game is
        rigged where the car moves from one &gt; &gt; &gt; door to the next :P )
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would stay with my first choice, though
        it doesnt matter. Its all &gt; &gt; &gt; personal preferance. &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Suppose you are at a TV show, where you have 3 doors. 1 of the

        the show &gt; &gt; &gt; presenter asks you to choose a door. So, you
        choose, but he doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; open your choosen door. He opens
        an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt; &gt; question: do you want to

        Thats a different relationship..NASCAR racing/Speed cubing. I only say
        that because NASCAR racers have to worry about life/death cases durring
        crashes. Cubers have to worry about a bad average. Anyways, I know a lot
        of times that if I speed through stuff with no conciquences, I tend to
        do better. (another bad relationship) In video games, if I am fighting
        the final boss with out much energy left, I tend to be much more careful
        and be sure not to get hurt. If i have full or extended energy I will
        just battle and not worry at all about being hurt. Cubing is the same
        way. If there was a no pop rule, I would go slower and be sure not to
        pop(low energy). But if pops were allowed like they are now and i poped,
        after that point i would work harder not pop(if I start to get low on
        energy). If I don't pop, I will feel free and will not have anything to
        worry about. I will not have popping on my mind and I will do
        better(full or extended energy). I'm not sure if my point is clear
        enough (and the relationship is probably pretty bad). I just think not
        allowing pops is a bad idea. Again, just my opinion. :) This may or may
        not apply to you. Peter Greenwood --- In

        Hi Chris, It depends, is it an extended 3x5? Or is it a fully functional

        What I would suggest, is to get a good speedcube, and test the torque
        required to turn it, that's what I did for mine at first. I just grabbed
        a ruler, taped it on to a side of my cube, and put weights on the end
        until it turned. (since I didn't have weights I used 1 ounce bags of tea
        ;-) So that will give you a very rough idea of what it takes to turn the
        cube. The next step, would probably be to find a surplus store with
        cheap stepper motors, and try out a couple to see if they can turn the
        cube. For my robot, the stepper motors were $10 a piece, and they can
        not only turn the cube faces, but can do so at relatively high speeds.
        Purely out of curiosity, what design are you thinking about for your
        robot? Hope that helps, -Evan Until next time, Happy Cubing

        &gt; &gt; &gt; we were just wondering what motor would be good? &gt;
        &gt; logically, we were thinking that a low rpm, high torque motor would
        be &gt; &gt; preferable, but we aren't sure about the numbers (like
        specific rpm and &gt; &gt; torque values) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, does
        anybody happen to have an estimate for how much it will cost &gt; &gt;
        to buy all the supplies necessary to build the most rudimentary cubing
        &gt; &gt; robot? (start out without color recognition....using manual
        input &gt; &gt; instead) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        If it is fully functional, don't you solve it as if it were a 5x5x5 with

        Sounds like you've got an extended. Its not much different than a
        regular 3x3. Think of the glued edges and corners as normal edges and
        corners. All 3x3 algs work on it, because it is a 3x3! :P Hope that

        I apply them one by one. I find that it helps to have the cube on the
        table and sit with your head directly above the cube when applying
        stickers. It's easier to center them that way. Good lighting and awesome
        hand-eye coordination helps, as well. Leyan christopher_pelley wrote:
        &gt; Leyan, I've been meaning to ask how you apply your tiles. Do you do
        &gt; them one by one? They come in a template that makes it seem like
        &gt; you could apply all 16 at once (or 9 at once on the 3x3). But in
        &gt; reality that makes most of the tiles come out crooked. So I've &gt;
        resorted to one by one, centering each tile by hand. Your 4x4 &gt;
        looked so perfect I wondered if you had any tips, other than lots of
        &gt; patience? &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        them &gt; &gt;&gt;on. Unlike stickers, these do not chip away with use.

        Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing group?
        The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would become
        a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 chance of
        winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice doesn't
        change your odds of winning (the host will always be able to show you a
        door with nothing behind it no matter which door you picked), but
        switching will turn your probabability of winning to 2/3. If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 doors and
        one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows you 98 doors
        with nothing behind them. Now it's much more obvious that you should
        switch, right? Shelley --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        can't seem to find anything that works. I peeked at Grant Tregay's site

        Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing group?
        The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would become
        a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 chance of
        winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice doesn't
        change your odds of winning (the host will always be able to show you a
        door with nothing behind it no matter which door you picked), but
        switching will turn your probabability of winning to 2/3. If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 doors and
        one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows you 98 doors
        with nothing behind them. Now it's much more obvious that you should
        switch, right? Shelley --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        don't know any clever tricks for the megaminx so, like you, I just use
        common sense, simple algs and commutators. Its just a little harder to

        Hi :-) I agree with Peter here. Not allowing ANY pop at all will make me
        cube slower/safer on the larger cubes. My DIY 3x3x3 i will never have to
        worry about popping. Allowing ONE pop for many solves is a good
        intermediate solution to the popping. Of course one could still abuse
        the one-pop rule in rounds where single best time will count. But even
        if this "cheat" is possible it's still fair. Everyone can abuse the rule
        in the same way. And those who occasionally pop unintentionally will
        feel more relaxed. Also, id like to add the the phenomenon of popping
        cubes is for the most part due to a bad/faulty cube of which the cuber
        has little control. If a cube (say a 5x5x5 occasionally pops must the
        cuber now purchase many cubes in order find a more stable cube? That's
        pretty expensive. As i said allowing ONE pop is a good way to deal with
        it. Has the one-pop rule caused any problems in any competition? Is that
        why it's now gonna be removed? And Stefan, i'm not quite sure which rule
        was applied when Masayuki Akimoto had a twisted center count as a DNF.
        Anyway, im against it. Likewise, ONE broken center on 4x4x4 or 5x5x5
        should be ok cause there is no ambiguity whether the puzzle is solved
        and there is no way to benefit from it. My easy philosophy is to have
        fair and nice rules without the burden of overly strict rules :-) And
        about stickers, i did ask Ron before the competition if they were
        allowed and he said no. So even if they are explicitly forbidden, which
        i think they are with the "no aid" paragraph i think we should either
        explicitly allow them or forbid them. Of course there are tricks to
        "mark" the cube without extra stickers. Like folding corners,
        removing/tearing stickers or whatever. Also for this reason i think
        using extra stickers ahould be explicitly allowed :-) Cheers! -PPer &gt;

        would go slower &gt; and be sure not to pop(low energy). But if pops
        were allowed like they &gt; are now and i poped, after that point i
        would work harder not pop (if I &gt; start to get low on energy). If I

        You can mention the Other-Color solving too. If you use white as main
        color, it would mean being able to speedsolve the cube starting with
        orange for example (on a BOY color scheme). BUt the hard part of this is
        that the edges you have to look for when you solve the F2L are
        different. Gilles. 2005/12/24, Pedro &lt;pedrosino1@...&gt;: &gt; Yeah
        &gt; If your usual color for the cross is white, opposite color solving

        I think you forget one thing in probabilities : the sum of the
        probability of all the cases is equal to one. First step : 3 doors : one
        winning (p = 1/3), two loosing (q = 2/3) Second step : 2 doors : one
        winning (p = 1/2), one loosing (q = 1/2) As it is said, you always reach
        the second step. I really can't see why the other door would then have a
        probability of 2/3 to be the winning one. 2005/12/25, Craig Bouchard

        another door there are 999 &gt; possibilities, and the third has no
        possibilities...so...he says pick &gt; a door, then you do...then he
        crosses off one door, thus leaving you &gt; with the decision...stick

        Yes, you can use commutators. Try taking out an edge, moving it to
        another place without adjusting it's orientation. Then take that edge
        you just moved and put it in the first edge's place, again keeping it's
        orientation. Thats the first half of the commutators. (you are solving
        in 3 cycles) This methods works. I know because, I use it! Good luck!

        help &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I got a new 12 sided Megaminx for
        Christmas, and I've figured out &gt; &gt; how to solve it (my first try,
        even)...almost. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Using basic 3x3 knowledge and common
        sense, I can solve all but the &gt; &gt; final layer. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Using commutators and simple algs on the final layer, I can solve
        the &gt; &gt; edge orientation easily, the corner permutation easily,
        and the corner &gt; &gt; orientation easily. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd
        really like to know if it's even possible to solve the edge &gt; &gt;
        permutation without setting myself back a few steps easily, because I
        &gt; &gt; can't seem to find anything that works. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        peeked at Grant Tregay's site to see what order he did the LL in, &gt;
        &gt; and he does it OE, PE, OC, PC. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not looking
        for the actual algs, really, just to know if it's &gt; &gt; possible,
        and maybe a hint in the right direction. I'd really like to &gt; &gt;
        figure it out (mostly) on my own. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any help would be
        very appreciated. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        This is absolutely correct Stefan. Another way to think about it that
        some people find easier: Suppose the host doesn't open a door but simply
        gives you the chance to switch from your original choice of one door to
        opening the other two doors. (This is in effect what the host is doing).
        Clearly you would switch from choosing one door to choosing two! There
        is an exact equivalence - the fact that the host shows you that one of
        the two doors you are switching to is empty is irrelevant. Duncan -----

        Yeah, most of you are right. The chance of winning is 2/3 if you switch
        the door. It looks strange at first, but it's not. See: On your firts
        choice, you have 1/3 of chance of winning, and 2/3 of losing. The host
        *just* can open an empty door. So, suppose you choose door A or 1. Each
        door has 1/3 of chance of containing the prize. So, your door has 1/3,
        and the other 2, together, have 2/3 of chance. So, if the host opens an
        empty door, the 2/3 probability is now on the other door (the one you
        didn't choose.) So, you'll win more times if you switch the door. Pay
        atention, you will *NOT ALWAYS WIN*. You'll just win more times than if
        you continue with your first choice. Pedro Leyan Lo &lt;leyanlo@...&gt;

        They have &gt; a different history! You know different things about
        them! &gt; &gt; Keeping your door, you win if and only if your original
        choice was &gt; correct. That's 1/3. &gt; &gt; Changing the door, you
        win if and only if your original choice was &gt; wrong. That's 2/3. &gt;

        &gt; Well said Stefan....and to all you pro-poppers - don't worry - &gt;
        contrary to what Tyson said, pops are still allowed! In fact, you
        &gt;can pop every solve - you just have to fix them now and press on
        &gt;instead of getting rewarded. That's exactly how I did it at the
        World Champs when I popped during the second cube of the second round. I
        had to chase the edge piece that popped across the table, reinsert it,
        finish solving, and if I remeber right, I had to reorient it at the end
        too. Ended up with a 26.89 time. Ouch! Jon www.nascarjon.us

        Is "choice" = "possibility"? If he tells me my door has the 1 and the
        other door has the 999, then of course I switch and am guaranteed 999
        (modulo his trustworthyness : -). But what if my door doesn't have the
        1? Does he change things behind the doors? Let me try to write the
        riddle how I think it's meant: There are three doors which hide 0/1/999
        coins respectively. You choose one. The host opens another, it has 0 or
        1 coins. You choose among the two closed doors and get what's behind it.
        Should you stay or switch? Is that it? If it is, then it's the same as
        the original question and you should switch. I've once read one ore two
        follow-up riddles to the original question and they differed slightly
        and still had surprisingly different answers. So maybe I guessed your
        riddle wrong. I don't see why your teacher would give you the same
        riddle as the original one and just make it unnecessarily complicated.

        Not exactly. He will be able to show you 98 doors with nothing behind
        them no matter which you picked initially, but his choice of the 98
        doors depends on which one you picked. Now, if the host starts the game
        by randomly eliminating 98 doors that don't have the prize and asking
        you to pick one of the two remaining ones, then yes, it is a 1/2 chance.
        However, as the game stands, you pick a door first. If you stay with
        your original choice, you will only win if you picked the winning door
        to begin with (a 1/100 chance). Shelley --- In

        Ok, I know believe that Switching is the strategy. Here is the reason :
        1. You choose one door (p = 1/3) 2. An empty door is opened. And here is
        the interesting fact : If you don't switch : the fact that the other
        door is opened doesn't change any thing and you still a p = 1/3. Now, if
        you switch : there are 2 cases : - If the car is indeed behind your
        door, the fact that the other is opened doesn't change anything and you
        still have a p = 1/3 - If the car is not behind your door, this means
        that the other door was opened because there was no other possibility to
        open an empty door. So this means the p now equals 2/3. This is not very
        clear yet in my head, but I believe that Switching is the dominant
        strategy. 2005/12/25, Pedro &lt;pedrosino1@...&gt;: &gt; ?? &gt; &gt;

        Shelley already mentioned it, but I'd like to point it out more clearly.
        I'll give you a new variant of the riddle that points out an important
        detail that can easily be misunderstood, leading to different results.
        ----- There are three doors, one hides a car. You pick a door. The host
        opens another and there's nothing. You choose between the two closed
        doors and get what's behind it. Should you stay or switch? ----- Variant
        1: The host knows what's behind the doors and when he opens one, he
        deliberately picks an empty one. Variant 2: The host does *not* know
        what's behind the doors and when he randomly opens one, it just happens
        to be empty. ----- Variant 1 is the original riddle with 2/3 probability

        I am assuming we are using varient one. Unless varient 2 means that all
        the time he will get an empty door, then they are both the same.
        Anyways, Why do you still have a 1/3 chance of getting the prize? You
        have 2 doors left, one with a prize. The third door had nothing behind
        it, and should just be ignored. Maybe a picture might help? Door1 Door2
        Door3 You pick door2 Host opens door1 Door1 is empty [door1] Door2 Door3
        You now have 2 doors to pick from: Door2(your first choice) or door3
        This means your first choice has a 1/2 chance of being correct. Why does
        the first door still count in the chances? Peter Greenwood --- In

        Ok, Peter, I'll try to be more clear you have 3 doors. Each one has 1/3
        of possibility of containing the prize. You pick one door. Your chance
        of winning is 1/3, right? And your chance of losing is 2/3, right? So,
        the host opens an empty door. You'll win without changing your door if
        you picked the correct one first (1/3 of posibility). And you'll lose
        without changing your door if you picked one of the incorrects first
        (2/3 of posibility). So, you'll win more times if you change your door.
        Is it clear now? Ok, if you want, you can write down all posibilities
        and see for yourself how many times you'll win if you don't change your
        choice (I actually made that when I first saw this problem). If it's not
        clear, please tell me and I'll think about a better explanation... Pedro

        a prize. The third door had nothing behind it, and should just be
        ignored. Maybe a picture might help? Door1 Door2 Door3 You pick door2

        &gt; &gt; There are three doors, one hides a car. You pick a door. The

        and when &gt; he randomly opens one, it just happens to be empty. &gt;

        This really is not making sense. How is opening an empty door different
        than just having 2 from the start? In both cases you have only 2 doors
        to choose from, one with the prize. Am I missing something? Peter

        other strategy. I bet you'll notice something. I just saw a hilarious
        variant: Suppose you are playing a seven door version of the game. You
        choose three doors. Monty now opens three of the remaining doors to show
        you that there is no prize behind it. He then says, "Would you like to
        stick with the three doors you have chosen, or would you prefer to swap
        them for the one other door I have not opened?" What do you do? Cheers!

        Hi :-) Sorry, that analogy does not hold water ;-) It is actually LEGAL
        to tip over all the hurdles and get a valid time, as long as u follow
        the lane from start to finish :D (And if not creeping under all of them
        ...) I will still say that most pops are not the fault of the cuber, or
        at least not in a predictable way. That's the real difference. If u tip
        over a hurdle it's the fault of the runner, and the runner knows exactly
        why he tipped the hurdle over. Sorry, but i feel strongly about this. I
        can live with the new rule, but i strongly disagree with the reasons for
        not allowing a single pop anymore. I haven't seen convincing theoretical
        or practical reasons :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        I agree with Per. There really isn't any reason to dis-allow ALL pops.
        Well, there is one, but it really doesn't mean anything. The only reason
        i have heard is that people will abuse it. They will purposely pop
        because they are having a bad time. The new rule is to make people not
        do this. The thing is, I have never met a cuber that I would think would
        do this. All of the cubers I have met are always nice and friendly. All
        of them would accept a bad time, even if it means a bad average. I am
        sure that a cuber could get ovwer it. Isn't that the point of doing
        this? To try to get better? Even if it means going to several
        competitions or doing 100 cubes in a row, I would live with the pop and
        do my best to get better. The makers of this new rule should get out
        more to see this! :) I really think a better reason for this rule is
        needed before it actually goes into effect. Peter Greenwood --- In

        It will be completely legal! I don't know what you want. Just like it is
        legal to tip over all hurdles and continue and get a valid time, you can
        pop and continue and get a valid time. Where's the problem? I think it's

        not the judges, it's not the other competitors, it's not the spectators.

        I have a question about the new rule, what if you pop a cube and it
        shoots off some where and you can't find it does the solve count as a
        DNF? And what if you find it like 5 min later do you have to pop it back

        After much thinking, I finally understand, the chances are better to
        switch doors. Yoi have a 2/3 chance of not picking the car as your first
        choice. Lets assume you don't pick the car, you pick an empty door. The
        host only has 1 choice of doors to open. Now since you picked an empty
        door, you would want to change! Now since you had a 2/3 chance of being
        wrong at first, 2/3 times you would want to change. Now if you did pick
        the car, the host would have 2 choices of doors, and you would lose if
        you switched. But getting the car first shot is 1/3 chance, not much
        compared to 2/3 of being wrong. This shows the chances are better to
        switch. I hope this clears up other people's confusion (it sure helped
        me!) Peter Greenwood --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        times one strategy and then 10 &gt; times the other strategy. I bet
        you'll notice something. &gt; &gt; I just saw a hilarious variant:
        Suppose you are playing a seven door &gt; version of the game. You
        choose three doors. Monty now opens three of &gt; the remaining doors to
        show you that there is no prize behind it. He &gt; then says, "Would you
        like to stick with the three doors you have &gt; chosen, or would you

        Hi Per, But it is legal to pop, and still finish with a valid time. If
        popping is not the fault of the cuber, then why do some people pop
        frequently, and others do not? What causes the popping that is not

        Hi Peter, When I solve, I don't ever consider going slower to avoid
        pops. I very rarely pop, because I've spent lots of time getting used to
        the cube and learning how to make turns accurately. If I were in a
        competition, and I popped, and I recorded a 40 second time in an average
        of five, I would need to make a choice. Do I want to try and set a fast
        average, and risk popping and essentially destroying my rank, or do I
        want to cube conservatively and try to place high in the competition.
        These are choices everyone has to make. The only difference now is that
        you aren't awarded a solve for something that was your fault. I really
        need you people to explain to my why pops are not the fault of the
        cuber, especially when I've spent time practicing to avoid pops. This
        was all outlined to me one fateful afternoon last year when I was cubing
        and jamming everywhere, and then Macky walks into my room, and makes a
        ridiculous number of moves in a ridiculously small amount of time and
        told me I needed to work on my accuracy. I learned that day that my cube
        didn't suck, I did. Frank Chang's cube is ludicrously loose. I've popped
        it while scrambling very slowly... but Frank doesn't pop. It was the
        same cube, but he didn't pop because he's practiced on that cube and so
        he can control it. Equipment failure is when something doesn't work the
        way it's supposed to. Pops have always been a part of solving. The cube
        is designed so that it can come apart... not while solving, and so when
        you solve, you shouldn't be taking the cube apart. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        The only &gt; reason i have heard is that people will abuse it. They
        will purposely &gt; pop because they are having a bad time. The new rule
        is to make people &gt; not do this. The thing is, I have never met a
        cuber that I would think &gt; would do this. All of the cubers I have
        met are always nice and &gt; friendly. All of them would accept a bad
        time, even if it means a bad &gt; average. I am sure that a cuber could
        get ovwer it. Isn't that the &gt; point of doing this? To try to get
        better? Even if it means going to &gt; several competitions or doing 100
        cubes in a row, I would live with &gt; the pop and do my best to get
        better. &gt; &gt; The makers of this new rule should get out more to see
        this! :) I &gt; really think a better reason for this rule is needed
        before it &gt; actually goes into effect. &gt; &gt; Peter Greenwood &gt;

        Hi Stefan, What we do mean is that if you pop, you simply put the cube
        back together and continue solving. When I first wrote the rules, it
        said, "may solve the cube by any means necessary." This was done to
        imply that if a competitor popped and wanted to fix the cube and
        continue, this was allowed. Popping intentionally to move pieces around
        when it's not necessary is not allowed, and is against the spirit of the
        rules, and perhaps needs to be outlined more literally. If you pop, you
        may fix your cube and continue. You could give up, but you could give up
        on any solve. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        If you pop a cube and you can't find the piece, well, that'd be really
        funny. You could continue searching for the piece, but if you stop the
        timer and the cube is not solved, it would be a DNF. If you really
        wanted to search the room for the piece, I guess that's fine. Other
        people can't help you find the piece because it would be part of the
        solve and there is no assistance during the solve. The way I see it,
        unless not completing that solve takes away your ability to record a
        valid average, then I think it would be rather inconsiderate to take up
        a timer for five minutes trying to record a time which won't affect you.

        say the corner connector snaps off or an entire center comes off. Can we
        roughly put the broken parts back in, try with much difficulty to solve
        the puzzle, then count it as a solve? Or can we make it a puzzle defect?
        And will puzzle defects be dealt with differently? Peter Greenwood ---

        1. No POPs will be allowed. The competitor will not be awarded an &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson/Ron, please clarify: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This means

        Hey Peter, If you break a puzzle, then you get an extra solve. That's
        actually a puzzle defect. Naturally, you can't break the puzzle on
        purpose, but of course, this is impossible to prove and I think we'd get
        a good kick out of the guy breaking his cube over and over again. In
        badminton, a friend of mine was playing a doubles games. You are not
        allowed to drink water unless the court judge allows you to step off the
        court. You are not allowed to step off the court, unless the official
        allows it‚Äîbut you are allowed to step off the court if you break
        equipment, such as your racket. The opponent broke his racket twice, and
        took drinks of water as he stopped off to get another one. I mean, the
        rule can be abused, but it's bad form, and I'm confident it won't need
        to be enforced. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        So I guess we can break down the no-pop rule as cubers not being used to
        their cubes? This rule will make cubers be more prepared to cube, or
        else they will pop and pay the price (a bad time) This rule is making
        competition standards just a little bit stiffer. People have to be
        prepared for their cube. One quick question: Lets say my puzzle breaks.
        I don't have another cube with me, so I ask my friend to borrow his. I
        am not used to his puzzle, and I pop. I know this would be a little bit
        tough for the judges to trace out, but this is a case where the no-pop
        rule is not fair. Peter Greenwood --- In

        Why? That's why I bring more than one cube, because I'm prepared for the
        competition, and I know the rules, and I'm ready to take out my number 2
        cube if my best cube dies. In badminton, if you have to borrow someone
        else's racket, you don't get a couple points to make up for that
        difference. That's why you carry three of the same type of racket if
        you're really hardcore, which I'm not. It depends how much you want to
        invest in cubing. If being amazing if your goal, then you probably
        should have more than one cube, because cubes die, just like everything
        else. Wow, so morbid. Fuzzy bunnies! Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, and perhaps needs to be outlined more literally.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you pop, you may fix your cube and
        continue. You could give up, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
        could give up on any solve. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tyson Mao

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. No POPs will be allowed. The competitor will
        not be awarded &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        extra solve if there is a puzzle defect during the solve.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tyson/Ron, please clarify:
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This means I can still pop but
        I must fix it and continue to get a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; valid time,
        right? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just read your text
        again and also the thread in the WCA forum &gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        I &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must admit that it's not 100% clear. It's
        possible to understand it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        POP=DNF (with no replacement solve). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I have asked this in the WCA forum thread
        before but &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get an

        turns as wrist turns, which is pretty impossible for speedcubing with my

        I've broken and turned center corners, even while solving slowly, on
        opposite sides of the cube that it was impossible to see until I turned

        California Institute of Technology Well, seeing as I bought my two best

        very slowly. One cube isn't even loose or lubed, and it still pops. The

        Hi :-) That's because not all cubes are equal. And also different cubing
        styles. But noone willingly adopts a style where popping is frequent.
        Well, except that generally higher speed causes more popping, and speed
        is what we want. That's why we compete :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        What causes the popping that is not &gt; controlled by the cuber? &gt;

        &gt; Hi :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, that analogy does not hold water
        ;-) It is actually LEGAL to &gt; &gt; tip over all the hurdles and get a
        valid time, as long as u follow &gt; &gt; the lane from start to finish
        :D (And if not creeping under all of &gt; &gt; them ...) I will still
        say that most pops are not the fault of the &gt; &gt; cuber, or at least
        not in a predictable way. That's the real &gt; &gt; difference. If u tip
        over a hurdle it's the fault of the runner, and &gt; &gt; the runner
        knows exactly why he tipped the hurdle over. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry,
        but i feel strongly about this. I can live with the new rule, &gt; &gt;
        but i strongly disagree with the reasons for not allowing a single &gt;
        &gt; pop anymore. I haven't seen convincing theoretical or practical
        &gt; &gt; reasons :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        If it really is a Rubik's 5x5, it should work. Are you sure you try to
        pull the pieces like on this picture ?

        Hey people I was doing an average...and got a good scramble I was going
        very well, it was a fast solve...but...when I put the cube down to stop
        the time, 3 pieces flew away! Man, I hate this stupid flat centers on my
        white DIY cube... Btw, the time was 15.14...it'd be my PB, but... the
        scramble was: F2 B2 D' L2 U' D2 F U2 L F' R D2 R' F' R' U2 L F' L' F' U2
        L F D2 L. My solution was 51 moves: Cross: L' D R F' R' F2 2st pair: y2
        L' U2 L U' L' U L 3rd pair: y U2 R U' R' U2 R U' R' 4th pair: y2 U' L' U
        L U2 L' U L Then I had a good OLL, with 4 corners to orient, 2 facing F
        and 2 facing B... at my real solve, I did y R U R' U R U' R' U R U2' R'
        and y2 R' U R' U' R' U' R' U R U R2. But after I figured out that if I
        do y' R U R' U R U' R' U R U2' R', I got the other U perm, which is
        faster for me. 51 moves/15.14 seconds = 3.37 moves/second Oh, and I did
        an average using just that scramble...best time was 11.36, and average
        was 13.37. Yeah, I know, I'm very slow...: ) Pedro

        thanks for the quick responses... I took a shopping trip today, and
        there dosn't seem to be any store that actually carries stepper motors.
        Does anybody know where we can get one(or 6, rather) of them? In

        model I saw on your site (1 motor attached to each face, so that they

        When I first wrote the rules, it &gt; said, &gt;&gt;&gt; "may solve the

        and is against the spirit of &gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt; rules, and perhaps
        needs to be outlined more literally. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you

        Hi Per, Everyone adopts their own cubing style, so when we write rules,
        we cannot consider the style at all. Obviously, this rule would affect
        people who are prone to popping differently than people who never pop,
        and so instead, we go and consider what ultimately cubing is about. In
        my mind, and people may disagree, cubing is the art of solving the cube
        by turning the faces and realigning the puzzle. I feel that misalignment
        and forcibly turning the puzzle is not a part of the puzzle solution,
        and so the pops the result from it are not condoned. If pops really
        aren't the fault of the cuber, then those people who feel this way
        should have been spending time previously to get a rule of 'infinite
        pops' added to the regulations. It would work the same way, since we can
        agree that basically no one pops on purpose, therefore if pops are not
        the fault of the cuber, you should get an extra solve. If you pop five
        times, you keep solving until you have five solves where you are happy,
        and then there's your average. Why wasn't this advocated in the past?
        Based on the logic that no pop is the fault of the competitor, I see it
        as the only fair way to run a competition. Instead, we allowed one. We
        recognized, and everyone recognized by not complaining, that the fault
        is somewhat the fault of the competitor. How much, it remains to be
        debated. The argument for pops being rewarded extra solves in a
        competition must address the following issue: why is popping
        fundamentally unavoidable while solving a cube? Speed is definitely
        want, but not at the expense of accuracy. We want to solve the cube as
        fast as possible, but it doesn't give us the liberty to be sloppy about
        it. In Sport Stacking (Cup Stacking), if you go faster, you fumble. If
        you fumble and not over the cups, you have to fix it. They don't give
        you an extra attempt. You have to choose what combination of speed and
        caution you want to use while solving the cube, and it has always been
        this way. You could go too fast and put in an F2L pair of the wrong
        color, but that doesn't award you an extra solve. Can you explain why
        popping is not the fault of the cuber? I haven't seen that question
        answered yet, and I really need it to be answered. What is it about
        solving the cube that popping is unavoidable? Why is exercising more
        caution during the solve against the principles of solving a cube as
        fast as possible? How come accuracy is something that should be left up
        to chance, instead of being mandated by the competitor solving the cube?

        I will still say that most pops are not the fault of &gt; the
        &gt;&gt;&gt; cuber, or at least not in a predictable way. That's the
        real &gt;&gt;&gt; difference. If u tip over a hurdle it's the fault of
        the runner, &gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt; the runner knows exactly why he tipped
        the hurdle over. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but i feel strongly
        about this. I can live with the new &gt; rule, &gt;&gt;&gt; but i
        strongly disagree with the reasons for not allowing a &gt; single
        &gt;&gt;&gt; pop anymore. I haven't seen convincing theoretical or

        Hi! Now u are just being platonistic. I never said that i supported what
        u "suggest" now. If ppl pop every solve they won't ever be able to get
        3/4/5 non-popping solves. Also i asked to hear any reason that current
        rule hasn't worked. My view here is more aristotelic ;-) I already
        explained why popping is not (solely) the fault of the cuber. And why
        would i need to elaborate on that anyway. U feel that no-pop is the way
        to go and i feel it's wrong. U are on the WCA board and i'm not. I will
        accept whatever rules you come upp with as long as they are fair and not
        overly strict. No-popping is a borderline case where i do feel the
        current regulations are good. About twisting centers on larger cubes i
        feel the current rules/practice is not good. One does NOT have full
        control over the centers if they want to twist or not. Why be punished
        when all cubies are in place and the cube is solved? As i said earlier
        there is NO ambiguity whether the cube is solved with one on more
        twisted centers. One broken center also causes no ambiguity. Two or more
        broken centers will. I will define a broken center as when a center
        breaks into two or more pieces. Not if one center snaps half way only.

        analogy does not hold water ;-) It is actually LEGAL &gt; &gt; to &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; tip over all the hurdles and get a valid time, as long as u
        &gt; &gt; follow &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the lane from start to finish :D (And
        if not creeping under all &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; them ...) I
        will still say that most pops are not the fault of &gt; &gt; the &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; cuber, or at least not in a predictable way. That's the
        real &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difference. If u tip over a hurdle it's the fault
        of the runner, &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the runner knows exactly
        why he tipped the hurdle over. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        Sorry, but i feel strongly about this. I can live with the new &gt; &gt;
        rule, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but i strongly disagree with the reasons for not
        allowing a &gt; &gt; single &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pop anymore. I haven't
        seen convincing theoretical or practical &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reasons :-)

        Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan, Sorry, you guys, but you aren't
        correct. In probability there's a thing called the law of large numbers.
        If you generate a long enough string of numbers "randomly" that
        eventually you would have every digit the same number of times. N
        oparticular number is favored. Your answer relies upon this law of
        randomness. What is actually wrong with the standard answere you gave is
        that one is not dealing with a large number of choices, and, as such,
        odds *do not apply.* I went to a site with the software and made my
        choice and did not switch and I won. Doing it more than once is outside
        the boundaries of the game. Cheers, David J --- In

        Did you play just one time?! Oh, no...I didn't say that switching you'll
        always win. I just said that you'll win more times if you switch...Ok,
        let me give another example. Suppose your friend has a bag with 3 balls
        inside. 2 are red and 1 is blue. So, he says that if you take a ball,
        without looking, and that ball is the blue one, he'll give you 10
        dollars. So, you go and take one ball, but don't look at it. Say you put
        in on your pocket. Then, your friend looks into the bag and takes out
        one red ball. And ask if you want to continue with the one that is in
        your pocket or change with the one left on the bag? What do you do? Now
        the explanation: your initial chance of taking the blue ball is 1/3,
        right? And what happens if you take the blue ball? The 2 red ones stay
        in the bag. So, the probability of the 2 red ones stay on the bag is the
        same as you taking the blue, which is 1/3. Correct? and your initial
        chance of taking one red ball is 2/3, because you have 2 red balls. So,
        if you take one red ball, what happens? 1 red and 1 blue stay on the
        bag. Right? The probability of 1 red and 1 blue ball stay on the bag is
        the same as you taking a red one, which is 2/3. Correct? Now, if your
        friend takes a red ball, what will happen? If there were 2 red balls on
        the bag, now there's 1 red ball. And if there were 1 red and 1 blue
        balls, now there's just the blue. So, which event has greater
        possibility of happen? 2 reds or 1 red and 1 blue? For 2 reds, the
        posibility is 1/3, and for 1 red and 1 blue the possibility is 2/3. So,
        you have a greater chance of winning if you change your ball for the one
        in the bag. You'll not win always, you'll win 2/3 of the time and lose
        1/3. Make a test. Do it 10 times with each strategy like Stefan
        suggested and tell us the results... Pedro d_j_salvia

        It takes some force if this is your first time doing this. Using a
        butter knife is a good idea. Let me know if it helps! It should work!

        &gt; Oh, no...I didn't say that switching you'll always win. I just said
        that you'll win more times if you switch...Ok, let me give another
        example. &gt; &gt; Suppose your friend has a bag with 3 balls inside. 2
        are red and 1 is blue. So, he says that if you take a ball, without
        looking, and that ball is the blue one, he'll give you 10 dollars. So,
        you go and take one ball, but don't look at it. Say you put in on your
        pocket. Then, your friend looks into the bag and takes out one red ball.
        And ask if you want to continue with the one that is in your pocket or
        change with the one left on the bag? What do you do? &gt; &gt; Now the
        explanation: &gt; your initial chance of taking the blue ball is 1/3,
        right? No this is not right. "Likelihood" does not apply to humans
        making choices, even random ones. In the Rhine studies, with the
        strictest protocols, it was found that humans in general consistantly
        "guessed" better than the "odds" predicted. Those who believed they
        could do better than chance often did much better than the odds, and
        those who refused to believe that they could do better than chance
        consistantly did worst than the odds predicted. While you can
        artificially construct "natural numbers," often examples given of
        randomness, like dice throwing and Brownian motion, have been found to
        *not* be random. Cheers, David J &gt; And what happens if you take the
        blue ball? The 2 red ones stay in the bag. So, the probability of the 2
        red ones stay on the bag is the same as you taking the blue, which is
        1/3. Correct? &gt; &gt; and your initial chance of taking one red ball
        is 2/3, because you have 2 red balls. So, if you take one red ball, what
        happens? 1 red and 1 blue stay on the bag. Right? The probability of 1
        red and 1 blue ball stay on the bag is the same as you taking a red one,
        which is 2/3. Correct? &gt; &gt; Now, if your friend takes a red ball,
        what will happen? If there were 2 red balls on the bag, now there's 1
        red ball. And if there were 1 red and 1 blue balls, now there's just the
        blue. So, which event has greater possibility of happen? 2 reds or 1 red
        and 1 blue? For 2 reds, the posibility is 1/3, and for 1 red and 1 blue
        the possibility is 2/3. So, you have a greater chance of winning if you
        change your ball for the one in the bag. You'll not win always, you'll
        win 2/3 of the time and lose 1/3. &gt; &gt; Make a test. Do it 10 times
        with each strategy like Stefan suggested and tell us the results... &gt;

        Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan, &gt; &gt; Sorry, you guys, but
        you aren't correct. &gt; &gt; In probability there's a thing called the
        law of large numbers. If you &gt; generate a long enough string of
        numbers "randomly" that eventually &gt; you would have every digit the
        same number of times. N oparticular &gt; number is favored. Your answer
        relies upon this law of randomness. &gt; &gt; What is actually wrong
        with the standard answere you gave is that one &gt; is not dealing with
        a large number of choices, and, as such, odds *do &gt; not apply.* &gt;
        &gt; I went to a site with the software and made my choice and did not
        &gt; switch and I won. Doing it more than once is outside the boundaries
        of &gt; the game. &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would &gt;
        &gt; become a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a
        1/3 &gt; &gt; chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with
        your choice &gt; &gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will
        always be able to &gt; &gt; show you a door with nothing behind it no
        matter which door you &gt; &gt; picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If my explanation
        makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt; &gt; doors and one
        door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows &gt; &gt; you 98
        doors with nothing behind them. Now it's much more obvious that &gt;
        &gt; you should switch, right? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shelley &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; (please forgive if I make some mistake on the english...)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose you are at a TV show, where you have 3

        a door. So, you choose, but he doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; open your choosen
        door. He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt; &gt; question:
        do you want to continue with your first choice or change to &gt; &gt;
        &gt; the other door? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you

        I did 100 trials, swithing my choice for 50 and keeping my choice for
        the other 50. The results: When keeping choice: 16/50 wins =&gt; 32%
        When changing choice: 32/50 wins =&gt; 64% Overall total: 48/100 wins
        =&gt; 48% Conclusion: You are twice as likely to win if you change your

        The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning choice would &gt;
        &gt; become a losing choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a
        1/3 &gt; &gt; chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with
        your choice &gt; &gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will
        always be able to &gt; &gt; show you a door with nothing behind it no
        matter which door you &gt; &gt; picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If my explanation
        makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt; &gt; doors and one
        door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host shows &gt; &gt; you 98
        doors with nothing behind them. Now it's much more obvious that &gt;

        &gt; Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing
        &gt; group? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The game is set up so that if
        you switch, a winning choice would &gt; &gt; &gt; become a losing choice
        and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance of
        winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will always be able
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which
        door you &gt; &gt; &gt; picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host
        shows &gt; &gt; &gt; you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it's
        much more obvious that &gt; &gt; &gt; you should switch, right? &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; It is counter intuitive, but if you are in this
        situation, your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chances would be better to switch to
        the other door. It's actually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite interesting.

        &gt; Suppose you are at a TV show, where you have 3 doors. 1 of the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; doors has a car, and the other 2 don't have anything. So,
        the show &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presenter asks you to choose a door. So,
        you choose, but he doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open your choosen door.
        He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question:
        do you want to continue with your first choice or &gt; change to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the other door? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; What do you do? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What situation gives

        Thanks for the algs. I also hate this COLL case, so I never used &gt;
        &gt; COLL (but a normal OLL) if I get this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you
        (or somebody else) also have good algs for the following &gt; &gt;
        terrible COLL cases (do their inverses to setup): &gt; &gt; 1. F' L2 F'

        R U2 R' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cases 3. and 4. are not so terrible, but
        maybe that somebody have &gt; &gt; better algs? Cases 1. and 2. on the
        other hand are very terrible for &gt; &gt; me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Michael Fung (Dutch cuber) &gt; &gt; Minor pieces of advice for 3 and 4:
        &gt; &gt; Use U turns to save on rotations and make F and B turns
        easier. Try &gt; those algs like this: &gt; &gt; (R' U' R)(F R2 D')(R U
        R' D)(R2 d' L') &gt; (F R2 U')(R2 U)(R2 d) R'(L U2 L') &gt; &gt; Also,
        for all of the Pi, T, and U COLL algs you're having problems &gt; with,
        I suggest heading to the ZB group to check out. We've been &gt;
        generating huge lists of algs for them, and I'm sure you can find &gt;
        something you like. &gt; &gt; -Mike &gt;

        Hi, I also support rewarding no extra solve for a Pop in a 5-solve,
        average-of-middle-3 competition. With our old rule it's possible to Pop
        twice without seriously affecting your average. Just call the first one
        a Pop to get another solve, and the second one will be your slowest
        solve and won't be counted in the average. (Of course, I realize that
        this may make a slower solve count in the average, but that's not a big
        problem if your solves are fairly consistent.) Out of the six solves,
        this means you can solve just 4 and still have an average where the
        three solves that count don't have Pops. Is that really stiff? I feel
        that 66.6% non-Pop rate deserves a heavier penalty than that. (This is a
        relatively light penalty compared to 2-second penalty, in my opinion.
        I'm still a bit bummed out about my 16.47+ in the second round in
        Florida. Of all the permutations, I had to get the worse one of the N
        perms, and messed up the finish. And U-face was off by a lot less than
        45 degrees. Of course, I really deserved it because I managed to get
        another penalty on the fourth solve, this time without any good excuse.)
        So let's all try not to Pop more than 20% of the time from now on! Plus,
        it won't affect your average if the Pop happens on your slowest solve. I
        really hope no one has to sacrifice his speed so much just to achieve an
        80% non-Pop rate...and really there's no excuse when you can buy a good
        cube at Target for $10. Ok, so everyone has bad luck from time to time,
        and it's possible that you Pop twice in an average. But the same can be
        said about almost every aspect of speedcubing (like my N perm). That's
        why we're changing to 5 solves for both 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. And just
        because I find this so amusing, here's a minilien to the original post:

        &gt; people who are prone to popping differently than people who never
        &gt; pop, &gt; &gt; and so instead, we go and consider what ultimately
        cubing is &gt; about. In &gt; &gt; my mind, and people may disagree,
        cubing is the art of solving the &gt; cube &gt; &gt; by turning the
        faces and realigning the puzzle. I feel that &gt; &gt; misalignment and
        forcibly turning the puzzle is not a part of the &gt; &gt; puzzle
        solution, and so the pops the result from it are not &gt; condoned. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; If pops really aren't the fault of the cuber, then those
        people &gt; who &gt; &gt; feel this way should have been spending time

        regulations. It would work the &gt; same &gt; &gt; way, since we can
        agree that basically no one pops on purpose, &gt; &gt; therefore if pops
        are not the fault of the cuber, you should get &gt; an &gt; &gt; extra
        solve. If you pop five times, you keep solving until you &gt; have &gt;
        &gt; five solves where you are happy, and then there's your average.
        &gt; Why &gt; &gt; wasn't this advocated in the past? Based on the logic
        that no pop &gt; is &gt; &gt; the fault of the competitor, I see it as
        the only fair way to run &gt; a &gt; &gt; competition. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Instead, we allowed one. We recognized, and everyone recognized
        &gt; by not &gt; &gt; complaining, that the fault is somewhat the fault
        of the &gt; competitor. &gt; &gt; How much, it remains to be debated.
        The argument for pops being &gt; &gt; rewarded extra solves in a
        competition must address the following &gt; &gt; issue: why is popping
        fundamentally unavoidable while solving a &gt; cube? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Speed is definitely want, but not at the expense of accuracy. We &gt;
        want &gt; &gt; to solve the cube as fast as possible, but it doesn't
        give us the &gt; &gt; liberty to be sloppy about it. In Sport Stacking
        (Cup Stacking), &gt; if &gt; &gt; you go faster, you fumble. If you
        fumble and not over the cups, &gt; you &gt; &gt; have to fix it. They
        don't give you an extra attempt. You have &gt; to &gt; &gt; choose what
        combination of speed and caution you want to use while &gt; &gt; solving
        the cube, and it has always been this way. You could go &gt; too &gt;
        &gt; fast and put in an F2L pair of the wrong color, but that doesn't
        &gt; award &gt; &gt; you an extra solve. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can you
        explain why popping is not the fault of the cuber? I &gt; haven't &gt;
        &gt; seen that question answered yet, and I really need it to be &gt;
        answered. &gt; &gt; What is it about solving the cube that popping is
        unavoidable? &gt; Why is &gt; &gt; exercising more caution during the
        solve against the principles of &gt; &gt; solving a cube as fast as
        possible? How come accuracy is &gt; something &gt; &gt; that should be
        left up to chance, instead of being mandated by the &gt; &gt; competitor
        solving the cube? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; &gt; MSC #631 &gt;

        So you say it's a 100% that I win if I stay... awesome conclusion. Just
        awesome... You can't drag the law of large numbers into this the way you
        are doing. It has nothing to do with odds only being true for many
        trials or not. It merely states that if you do something enough times it
        will converge towards the "true" odds. Which in this case is 1/3 and
        2/3. So what it in fact can be used for is to make the choices many
        times (like others suggested), ad them up and calculate odds that come
        nearer and nearer to the real odds. In this way you can "prove" that the
        odds are in fact 1/3 and 2/3 if you do it enough times. I challenge you
        to repeat Bob's 100 trials and and test your hypothesis against a 95%
        confidence interval or so... With a solid year or so at university in
        probability and statistics and very confident in this. Ask all the
        probability/statistics professors in the world if the odds are 1/3 and
        2/3, and I strongly believe that the law of large numbers will make the
        will make this converge towards 100% agreeing. In fact I challenge you
        to ask a single probability/statistics professor about this and let us
        all know about his/her answer. Take on the one or both of the challenges
        above and then come back and say it's not true. I bet you my upcoming
        2x2x2 average WR that you can't do it ;) /Gustav d_j_salvia skrev:
        &gt;Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan, &gt; &gt;Sorry, you guys,

        Excellent explanation! When I was young and knew everything, I KNEW that
        changing doors didn't matter. So I wrote a short program to run around
        1000000 tests of this and catalogue how often the contestant won after
        switching, and how oftent they won after not switching. It was always
        very close to 1/3 without switching and 2/3 after switching. I
        eventually figured out the logic behind the below post, and was
        convinced. Interestingly, (now that I am older, wiser, and have a bit
        better math background) I used this same approach from time to time to
        check my work on a few probability assignments that I really felt shakey
        on. It's not highly efficient, but it lets me combine two things I
        really enjoy: Math and Programming. -Daniel --- In

        show, where you have 3 doors. 1 of the &gt; &gt; doors has a car, and
        the other 2 don't have anything. So, the show &gt; &gt; presenter asks
        you to choose a door. So, you choose, but he doesn't &gt; &gt; open your
        choosen door. He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt;
        question: do you want to continue with your first choice or change to
        &gt; &gt; the other door? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you do?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; What situation gives you more chances of winning? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think about it... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I think I figured out what the last character in the manufacturing code
        is for. Apparently, cubes with flat centers are known as type A, and are
        marked as such. The newer arched centers are type B, also marked
        accordingly. For those who don't know about the code, you can find it on
        Hasbro-era cubes by rotating each face 45 degrees. It will be on one of
        the corner pieces, a 6-character code designating the year, month, and
        cube type. Example: M1005B This is a cube manufactured in October 2005
        with arched centers. I guess the M stands for "manufacture" since they
        all seem to start with M. Anybody have any codes that conflict with this

        I was imagining some future competition with more attempts, maybe 10 or

        no allowances for mistakes and accidents at all. I think the origin of
        the somewhat odd custom of not counting the best and worst time is to
        measure a representative average ("average average") without having
        extreme cases affect the result, but in practice it does serve to make
        it OK to have a few mistakes. And I think that's good, even though I
        would agree that those mistakes are the fault of the solver. Though at
        the other end, it *is* pretty weird that the fastest solves don't even
        count. I can't think of another sport that does that. If there were
        really no pops at all in the latest final, that does show it's not much
        to worry about, at least for people in that level. /Lars On Dec 26,

        I think that has something to do with the nature of our sport. In most
        competitive sports where timing is involved, i.e. track and field or
        swimming or any type of race, the athlete exerts maximum effort
        (generally) in each run. There isn't as big of an element of randomness
        or luck. Okay, weather, temperature, track surface, psychological things
        all play a part, but the sport itself does not have inherent randomness.
        Cubing however has randomness. Without defining what random or favorable
        or unfavorable is, we can all agree that favorable and unfavorable
        conditions come up with each solve and are beyond the control of anyone.
        I guess that's why I feel truncating the times in an average is slightly
        more appropriate. I'm not justifying it completely, but it makes some
        sense. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Dec 27,

        2005/12/27, cube_padiwan &lt;ncp_3@m...&gt;: &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello
        everyone! I've tried but have been unable to find an &gt; algorithm or
        &gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial for matching the three pieces of the last two
        edges of a &gt; &gt; &gt; Professor (5x5x5) Cube. I'm trying to solve
        the Professor cube by &gt; using &gt; &gt; &gt; the method where you
        solve the centers first, then match all the &gt; edge &gt; &gt; &gt;
        pieces together, which turns the Cube into a 3x3x3. I can get all &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; edge pieces matched together except for the pieces of
        the last two &gt; &gt; &gt; edges! This is very aggravating! If anyone
        knows how to do this &gt; or has &gt; &gt; &gt; a link to a site whcih
        explains this, your help would be very much &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated!

        I like this explanation : "There are three possible scenarios, each with
        equal probability (1/3): * The player picks goat number 1. The game host
        picks the other goat. Switching will win the car. * The player picks
        goat number 2. The game host picks the other goat. Switching will win
        the car. * The player picks the car. The game host picks either of the
        two goats. Switching will lose. In the first two scenarios, the player
        wins by switching. The third scenario is the only one where the player
        wins by staying. Since two out of three scenarios win by switching and
        each scenario is equally likely, the odds of winning by switching are
        2/3. In other words, a player who has a policy of always switching will
        win the car on average two times out of the three." (wikipedia) Gilles

        I used 6 servo motors, if you have a loose and smooth cube, very little

        should be the basic goal. I had to go into and mod the motors to do what
        I wanted though... and there's nothing wrong with over-volting them a
        bit :0. I had it run a human method (CFCE), but if you can implenment an

        &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt; escreveu: I think I figured out what
        the last character in the manufacturing code is for. Apparently, cubes
        with flat centers are known as type A, and are marked as such. The newer
        arched centers are type B, also marked accordingly. For those who don't
        know about the code, you can find it on Hasbro-era cubes by rotating
        each face 45 degrees. It will be on one of the corner pieces, a
        6-character code designating the year, month, and cube type. Example:
        M1005B This is a cube manufactured in October 2005 with arched centers.
        I guess the M stands for "manufacture" since they all seem to start with
        M. Anybody have any codes that conflict with this scheme? Chris

        I got some white ones as recently as October and they were still type A.
        For some reason, Rubiks.com altered their photo of the white kit to
        depict arched centers. This has led to speculation that white type B
        cubes are in the making. They still limit us to 2 cubes per order, like
        it's some limited edition thing. So it may take a while to clear their
        existing type A stock. Chris --- In

        Because you can't say that "the choice" made by a human was "random." On
        top of that this randomness is supposed to apply to many humans. The

        you'll always win. I just &gt; said that you'll win more times if you
        switch...Ok, let me give &gt; another example. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Suppose your friend has a bag with 3 balls inside. 2 are red and 1 &gt;
        is blue. So, he says that if you take a ball, without looking, and &gt;
        that ball is the blue one, he'll give you 10 dollars. So, you go and
        &gt; take one ball, but don't look at it. Say you put in on your pocket.
        &gt; Then, your friend looks into the bag and takes out one red ball.
        And &gt; ask if you want to continue with the one that is in your pocket
        or &gt; change with the one left on the bag? What do you do? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Now the explanation: &gt; &gt; your initial chance of taking
        the blue ball is 1/3, right? &gt; &gt; No this is not right.
        "Likelihood" does not apply to humans making &gt; choices, even random
        ones. &gt; &gt; In the Rhine studies, with the strictest protocols, it
        was found that &gt; humans in general consistantly "guessed" better than
        the "odds" &gt; predicted. Those who believed they could do better than
        chance often &gt; did much better than the odds, and those who refused
        to believe that &gt; they could do better than chance consistantly did
        worst than the odds &gt; predicted. &gt; &gt; While you can artificially
        construct "natural numbers," often examples &gt; given of randomness,
        like dice throwing and Brownian motion, have been &gt; found to *not* be
        random. &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; And what
        happens if you take the blue ball? The 2 red ones stay in &gt; the bag.
        So, the probability of the 2 red ones stay on the bag is the &gt; same
        as you taking the blue, which is 1/3. Correct? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        your initial chance of taking one red ball is 2/3, because you &gt; have
        2 red balls. So, if you take one red ball, what happens? 1 red &gt; and
        1 blue stay on the bag. Right? The probability of 1 red and 1 blue &gt;
        ball stay on the bag is the same as you taking a red one, which is &gt;
        2/3. Correct? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, if your friend takes a red ball,
        what will happen? If there &gt; were 2 red balls on the bag, now there's
        1 red ball. And if there were &gt; 1 red and 1 blue balls, now there's
        just the blue. So, which event has &gt; greater possibility of happen? 2
        reds or 1 red and 1 blue? For 2 reds, &gt; the posibility is 1/3, and
        for 1 red and 1 blue the possibility is &gt; 2/3. So, you have a greater
        chance of winning if you change your ball &gt; for the one in the bag.
        You'll not win always, you'll win 2/3 of the &gt; time and lose 1/3.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make a test. Do it 10 times with each strategy like
        Stefan &gt; suggested and tell us the results... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Hi Duncan and Stefan and Pedro and Evan, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Sorry, you guys, but you aren't correct. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In
        probability there's a thing called the law of large numbers. If you &gt;
        &gt; generate a long enough string of numbers "randomly" that eventually
        &gt; &gt; you would have every digit the same number of times. N
        oparticular &gt; &gt; number is favored. Your answer relies upon this
        law of randomness. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is actually wrong with the
        standard answere you gave is that one &gt; &gt; is not dealing with a
        large number of choices, and, as such, odds *do &gt; &gt; not apply.*
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to a site with the software and made my
        choice and did not &gt; &gt; switch and I won. Doing it more than once
        is outside the boundaries of &gt; &gt; the game. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing &gt;
        group? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The game is set up so that if you
        switch, a winning choice would &gt; &gt; &gt; become a losing choice and
        vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance of
        winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will always be able
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which
        door you &gt; &gt; &gt; picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host
        shows &gt; &gt; &gt; you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it's
        much more obvious that &gt; &gt; &gt; you should switch, right? &gt;

        &gt; Suppose you are at a TV show, where you have 3 doors. 1 of the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; doors has a car, and the other 2 don't have anything. So,
        the show &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presenter asks you to choose a door. So,
        you choose, but he doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open your choosen door.
        He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question:
        do you want to continue with your first choice or &gt; change to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the other door? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; What do you do? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What situation gives
        you more chances of winning? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Think about it... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        that the "subtitle" of the orinal magics was "link the rings" and
        "unlink the rings", not "(un)stack the rings". Very very sad. I mean,

        into this the way you are doing. &gt; It has nothing to do with odds
        only being true for many trials or not. &gt; It merely states that if
        you do something enough times it will converge &gt; towards the "true"
        odds. Which in this case is 1/3 and 2/3. You just said that I can't
        can't put in the realm of the law of large numberfs, and then you
        immediately defend its position within the realm of large numbers. You
        can't have it both ways - either it applies or it doesn't. The number of
        games is part of where you are going wrong. There is one trial is the
        classic example - what effect does it have on one game? None. In the
        same way that you cannot predict when a radiactive atom will decay. &gt;
        So what it &gt; in fact can be used for is to make the choices many
        times (like others &gt; suggested), ad them up and calculate odds that
        come nearer and nearer to &gt; the real odds. In this way you can
        "prove" that the odds are in fact 1/3 &gt; and 2/3 if you do it enough
        times. I challenge you to repeat Bob's 100 &gt; trials and and test your
        hypothesis against a 95% confidence interval or &gt; so... I wrote a
        program in Basic on an Atati 800. Making a choice between 1, 2, and 3
        generated at random, I decided never to switch. Out of 100 "games" I
        "won the car" 76 times. &gt; With a solid year or so at university in
        probability and statistics and &gt; very confident in this. Ask all the
        probability/statistics professors in &gt; the world if the odds are 1/3
        and 2/3, and I strongly believe that the &gt; law of large numbers will
        make the will make this converge towards 100% &gt; agreeing. In fact I
        challenge you to ask a single probability/statistics &gt; professor
        about this and let us all know about his/her answer. Why should I answer
        a challenge which is dependent upon how well another person thinks? &gt;
        Take on the one or both of the challenges above and then come back and
        &gt; say it's not true. I bet you my upcoming 2x2x2 average WR that you

        &gt; &gt; &gt;In probability there's a thing called the law of large
        numbers. If you &gt; &gt;generate a long enough string of numbers
        "randomly" that eventually &gt; &gt;you would have every digit the same
        number of times. N oparticular &gt; &gt;number is favored. Your answer
        relies upon this law of randomness. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What is actually
        wrong with the standard answere you gave is that one &gt; &gt;is not
        dealing with a large number of choices, and, as such, odds *do &gt;
        &gt;not apply.* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I went to a site with the software
        and made my choice and did not &gt; &gt;switch and I won. Doing it more

        another cubing group? &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The game is set up so
        that if you switch, a winning choice would &gt; &gt;&gt;become a losing
        choice and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 &gt;
        &gt;&gt;chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your
        choice &gt; &gt;&gt;doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will
        always be able to &gt; &gt;&gt;show you a door with nothing behind it no
        matter which door you &gt; &gt;&gt;picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt;
        &gt;&gt;doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host
        shows &gt; &gt;&gt;you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it's much
        more obvious that &gt; &gt;&gt;you should switch, right? &gt; &gt;&gt;

        Hi Daniel, By removing the human element your computer program only
        shows that the pseudo-"random number generator" you used works well

        &gt; you originally chose, and the last one that he hasn't open. Staying
        &gt; with &gt; &gt; your first choice, you still have a 1% chance. But
        if you switch, &gt; you have &gt; &gt; a 99% chance. There is a reason
        that he hasn't yet opened that &gt; door. By &gt; &gt; opening the other
        ones, he's giving you a clue about where the car is. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Hmm, lets see. You start with 3 doors, one with a car. The host
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cancels out a door giving you 2 doors. That means your
        guess has a 1/2 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance of being correct. There is no
        point in changing, its 50-50 no &gt; &gt; &gt; matter what. (unless the

        Hi ! That's more evidence to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It
        really is no problem timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due to
        (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not having to
        worry too much about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic is "out-debated".
        What happens will happen. Unless the WCA board decides that we gonna
        have a vote or something over it :-) I have written lots here about
        popping, but still my main concerns are that twisting centers should be
        allowed and also a single broken center (or any single cubie) as long as
        there is no ambiguity the cube/puzzle is solved. There is no way to
        benefit from those cube defects :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; Yes, there really weren't any. And only 2 (declared) pops in the

        Hi Stefan :-) Screwing up your OLL is YOUR fault, not the cube in any
        way whatsoever. If you cannot see the difference i feel sorry for you ;-
        ) I don't understand anyone who can use such extreme ways to argue for
        or against something. Like : - allowing ONE pop ... OMG then we MUST
        allow many pops ... - popping is same as screwing up OLL I call such
        arguments platonistic,not trying to see compromises in solutions to
        practical problems ;-) The understanding that all POP's are due to human
        mistakes is wrong. I have argued enough for this already ... -Per PS!

        &gt; Pedro Hi Pedro, I don't see why not, though I don't know where you
        can find an Atari 800. To do what I did you need to program the computer
        yourself. The fundamentals: Have the computer raise it's "game" counter
        by one, When the "game" counter surpasses 100 have the computer tell you
        the # of "wins." randomly generate a number, either 1, 2, or 3, have it
        ask you for input, You input the number one two or three, (You can
        figure out how to eliminate one of the other "doors" to choose again.)
        This must take the same amount of time every time, whether you guessed
        correctly or not. There must not be even a fraction of a second
        difference in this procedure viv a vis the correctness of your first
        choice. If there is, your mind can perceive it, and effect your second
        choice. Have a procedure for keeping or switching your choice. have the
        computer compare your input to the generated number, if they match, have
        the computer raise the "win" counter by one. Do *not* have the computer
        tell you whether you have won or lost except at the end. Start over Get
        the idea? Regards, David J &gt; &gt; d_j_salvia &lt;d_j_salvia@y...&gt;

        &gt; &gt; Excuse me but i did not say that. &gt; &gt; &gt; You can't
        drag the law of large numbers into this the way you are &gt; doing. &gt;
        &gt; It has nothing to do with odds only being true for many trials or
        not. &gt; &gt; It merely states that if you do something enough times it
        will converge &gt; &gt; towards the "true" odds. Which in this case is
        1/3 and 2/3. &gt; &gt; You just said that I can't can't put in the realm
        of the law of large &gt; numberfs, and then you immediately defend its
        position within the &gt; realm of large numbers. You can't have it both
        ways - either it &gt; applies or it doesn't. &gt; &gt; The number of
        games is part of where you are going wrong. There is one &gt; trial is
        the classic example - what effect does it have on one game? &gt; None.
        In the same way that you cannot predict when a radiactive atom &gt; will
        decay. &gt; &gt; &gt; So what it &gt; &gt; in fact can be used for is to
        make the choices many times (like others &gt; &gt; suggested), ad them
        up and calculate odds that come nearer and &gt; nearer to &gt; &gt; the
        real odds. In this way you can "prove" that the odds are in fact &gt;
        1/3 &gt; &gt; and 2/3 if you do it enough times. I challenge you to
        repeat Bob's 100 &gt; &gt; trials and and test your hypothesis against a
        95% confidence &gt; interval or &gt; &gt; so... &gt; &gt; I wrote a
        program in Basic on an Atati 800. Making a choice between 1, &gt; 2, and
        3 generated at random, I decided never to switch. Out of 100 &gt;
        "games" I "won the car" 76 times. &gt; &gt; &gt; With a solid year or so
        at university in probability and statistics and &gt; &gt; very confident
        in this. Ask all the probability/statistics &gt; professors in &gt; &gt;
        the world if the odds are 1/3 and 2/3, and I strongly believe that the
        &gt; &gt; law of large numbers will make the will make this converge
        towards 100% &gt; &gt; agreeing. In fact I challenge you to ask a single
        &gt; probability/statistics &gt; &gt; professor about this and let us
        all know about his/her answer. &gt; &gt; Why should I answer a challenge
        which is dependent upon how well &gt; another person thinks? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Take on the one or both of the challenges above and then come back
        and &gt; &gt; say it's not true. I bet you my upcoming 2x2x2 average WR
        that you &gt; can't &gt; &gt; do it ;) &gt; &gt; I'm sorry you lost the

        Time difference? So if I understand you correctly, humans have a certain
        ESP which is also depended on the time variation in the decisions? So
        far, the latest arguments have all been that humans are able to
        influence things that are random and have an ability to get the 'right'
        answer when they don't know any information regarding the answer at all.
        However, can you agree that a computer playing the game will win 2/3 of

        Although I like the one pop rule, I do agree that popping one out of
        three solves is a lot. I think popping is (or mostly is) the cuber's
        fault, since I rarely pop on my cube but pretty much always pop on my
        friend's. Maybe there could be something like a one pop per
        competition/event? That way those who pop frequently still have to work
        on their accuracy but those who don't pop very often won't be as worried
        about accidentally popping? That should also take care of the randomness

        I don't think that that new pop rule will change much. When you train
        with your cube, I'm pretty sure nobody pops more than twice in 5 solves
        (of course it could happen, but then it means either your cube is bad
        and you should fix it, or that you turn when the faces are not aligned).
        In both cases, the cuber could minimise the risk of popping far under
        one in 5 solves. Gilles. 2005/12/27, Vincent Le

        stupidity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Stefan, &gt; &gt; If I thought you were stupid I would not put so
        much effort into &gt; explaining my thoughts on the matter. &gt; &gt; I
        did the experiment and reported the result. If the result does not &gt;
        coincide with your beliefs that is not my problem. &gt; &gt; If you did
        not check the program that you used for this test, to see &gt; it there
        was any time difference between processing a correct initial &gt; guess
        and processing an incorrect initial guess, then you cannot tell &gt; me
        for certain that you know that you got no feedback cues whatsoever. &gt;
        &gt; Did you check? &gt; &gt; Bye, &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I'm not sure If I am the first peron to ever do it, but I have
        successfully made a few home-made magic strings. I just used some strong
        fishing line (20 lb. test) for the string and made a special knot. I got

        &gt; &gt; Kel I don't know if someone can "intuit" a solution but many
        cubers started cubing using their own abilities and found their own
        solution. My experience with the cube without method was that: First I
        found that doing a layer was quite easy. Then the first thing that came
        to me was the opposite corners, but I was obsessed to not break my 1st
        layer, I found 1 sequence for corner permutation and another for
        orientation. then I was lokking for an alg to put one edge from the
        middle layer to the Down layer. then I tried to find sequences that
        didn't change the 2 layers i've built and find an edge orientation alg.
        To conclude, permute middle layer edges was quite intuitive. Thats how
        I've discovered my method..or "intuit" it because after that i could
        always solve the cube in less than 5 mins. Keep on cubing. sebastien

        Well I may have put it badly. Of course the law of large number applies,
        it's a law after all. But what you used is not the law of large numbers
        at all. Funny thing was that you can actually use the law of large
        numbers to "prove" the answer will be 1/3, 2/3. Here's the law of large
        number in case you forgot it :
        http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeakLawofLargeNumbers.html You also believe
        that the odds of rolling a 6 on a regular six sided dice is not 1/6?
        That this cannot be true because it does not apply for a single roll?
        Maybe there's a 50/50 chance on for each number? This may sound stupid,
        and it is... but it's not very different from your argument. Please read
        the law of large numbers again and revise your use of it. /Gustav

        &gt; &gt;&gt;You can't drag the law of large numbers into this the way
        you are &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;doing. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It has nothing to
        do with odds only being true for many trials or not. &gt;&gt;It merely
        states that if you do something enough times it will converge
        &gt;&gt;towards the "true" odds. Which in this case is 1/3 and 2/3.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;You just said that I can't can't put in the
        realm of the law of large &gt;numberfs, and then you immediately defend
        its position within the &gt;realm of large numbers. You can't have it
        both ways - either it &gt;applies or it doesn't. &gt; &gt;The number of
        games is part of where you are going wrong. There is one &gt;trial is
        the classic example - what effect does it have on one game? &gt;None. In
        the same way that you cannot predict when a radiactive atom &gt;will
        decay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what it &gt;&gt;in fact can be used
        for is to make the choices many times (like others &gt;&gt;suggested),
        ad them up and calculate odds that come nearer and &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt;nearer to &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the real odds. In this way you can
        "prove" that the odds are in fact &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1/3 &gt; &gt;

        Pedro and Evan, &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, you guys, but you aren't
        correct. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In probability there's a thing called
        the law of large numbers. If you &gt;&gt;&gt;generate a long enough
        string of numbers "randomly" that eventually &gt;&gt;&gt;you would have
        every digit the same number of times. N oparticular &gt;&gt;&gt;number
        is favored. Your answer relies upon this law of randomness. &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;What is actually wrong with the standard answere you gave is
        that one &gt;&gt;&gt;is not dealing with a large number of choices, and,
        as such, odds *do &gt;&gt;&gt;not apply.* &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I
        went to a site with the software and made my choice and did not
        &gt;&gt;&gt;switch and I won. Doing it more than once is outside the
        boundaries of &gt;&gt;&gt;the game. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Cheers,

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in
        another cubing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;group? &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The game is set up so that if you switch, a winning
        choice would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;become a losing choice and vice versa. In
        the beginning you had a 1/3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chance of winning and 2/3
        chance of losing. Staying with your choice &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't
        change your odds of winning (the host will always be able to
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which
        door you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and
        the host shows &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you 98 doors with nothing behind them.
        Now it's much more obvious that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you should switch,
        right? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shelley &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is counter intuitive, but if you are in this
        situation, your &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chances would be better to switch to
        the other door. It's actually &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;quite interesting.

        a door. So, you choose, but he doesn't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;open your
        choosen door. He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a

        63 people who have ever solved it and you get a certificate or something
        if you do! She spent the next 2 hours trying to do it again, but no joy.

        Hi friends, I think everything has been said now about extra attempt for
        pops. Thank you all for your input. There is still a majority favoring
        no extra attempts for pops, even for the bigger cubes. In return these
        cubers get 5 instead of 3 attempts. Let us see what 2006 brings. Stefan,
        for WC2003 there were no clear regulations about the cubing itself.
        Actually there were a few people (even finalists) getting extra attempts
        for having the last face not correctly aligned. On one occasion there
        was someone getting two extra attempts for the same cube. And each of
        the three scrambles was the same! There was also no limit for pops, so
        there was someone who had 3 pops, and received 3 extra attempts. Another
        thing was that the regulations were very personal, one judge would react
        differently than another judge. We should be happy now that we have good
        regulations. :-) About the twisted center corner of Masayuki Akimoto. It
        is my mistake that the twisted center corner for Masayuki for his 5x5x5
        attempt was not allowed. The judge came to me together with Masayuki,
        and asked me whether it was allowed or not. Even Masayuki said that he
        would not have a problem if it were not allowed. I was in doubt at that
        moment, so I should have checked the regulations. The regulations 2005
        say: " All pieces of the puzzle must be ATTACHED to the puzzle for it to
        be solved. If a piece of the puzzle is EJECTED as the puzzle is placed
        down but it is otherwise solved, then the puzzle is not considered to be
        in a solved state. " The piece was attached, but ejected and not in
        solved position. Reading back now I think it should have been allowed. I
        am glad in the end it did not make much of a difference. Although I am
        not sure whether it was Masayuki's fastest time of the competition and
        thus a Japanese record. My mistake. Sorry. Lesson learnt. About the
        center corner of 5x5x5 being broken. The regulations 2005 say: "If a non
        functional part of a puzzle is defect/ejected and the puzzle is still
        unambiguously in a solved state, then the puzzle is considered solved,
        under discretion of the judge." In this case you could consider the flat
        part of the center corner to be a non functional part, because the inner
        part of the center is still in place. If the puzzle is unambiguously in
        a solved state, so only one of the center corners with this problem,
        then the puzzle should be considered solved. Looking forward to more
        competitions in 2006 in more countries, with even more fun. Have fun,

        That's more evidence to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It
        really is no problem timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due to
        (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not having to
        worry too much about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic is "out-debated".
        What happens will happen. Unless the WCA board decides that we gonna
        have a vote or something over it :-) I have written lots here about
        popping, but still my main concerns are that twisting centers should be
        allowed and also a single broken center (or any single cubie) as long as
        there is no ambiguity the cube/puzzle is solved. There is no way to
        benefit from those cube defects :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        semi &gt; final, i.e. 2 pops in 182 solves (36 competitors). Don't know
        about &gt; round 1, there are no pops but dnfs and they could mean
        anything. &gt; &gt; Looking at the WC 2003 results, I don't see any pops
        at all. But I &gt; could imagine that the free-replacement-for-pops rule
        didn't exist &gt; back then, is that correct? &gt; &gt;

        everything has been said now about extra attempt for pops. Thank you
        &gt; all for your input. &gt; There is still a majority favoring no
        extra attempts for pops, even for the &gt; bigger cubes. In return these
        cubers get 5 instead of 3 attempts. &gt; Let us see what 2006 brings.
        &gt; &gt; Stefan, for WC2003 there were no clear regulations about the
        cubing itself. &gt; Actually there were a few people (even finalists)
        getting extra attempts for &gt; having the last face not correctly
        aligned. On one occasion there was &gt; someone getting two extra
        attempts for the same cube. And each of the three &gt; scrambles was the
        same! There was also no limit for pops, so there was &gt; someone who
        had 3 pops, and received 3 extra attempts. Another thing was &gt; that
        the regulations were very personal, one judge would react differently
        &gt; than another judge. &gt; We should be happy now that we have good
        regulations. :-) &gt; &gt; About the twisted center corner of Masayuki
        Akimoto. &gt; It is my mistake that the twisted center corner for
        Masayuki for his 5x5x5 &gt; attempt was not allowed. &gt; The judge came
        to me together with Masayuki, and asked me whether it was &gt; allowed
        or not. Even Masayuki said that he would not have a problem if it &gt;
        were not allowed. &gt; I was in doubt at that moment, so I should have
        checked the regulations. &gt; The regulations 2005 say: &gt; " &gt; All
        pieces of the puzzle must be ATTACHED to the puzzle for it to be solved.
        &gt; If a piece of the puzzle is EJECTED as the puzzle is placed down
        but it is &gt; otherwise solved, then the puzzle is not considered to be
        in a solved state. &gt; " &gt; &gt; The piece was attached, but ejected
        and not in solved position. Reading back &gt; now I think it should have
        been allowed. &gt; I am glad in the end it did not make much of a
        difference. Although I am not &gt; sure whether it was Masayuki's
        fastest time of the competition and thus a &gt; Japanese record. &gt;
        &gt; My mistake. Sorry. Lesson learnt. &gt; &gt; About the center corner
        of 5x5x5 being broken. &gt; The regulations 2005 say: &gt; "If a non
        functional part of a puzzle is defect/ejected and the puzzle is &gt;
        still unambiguously in a solved state, then the puzzle is considered
        solved, &gt; under discretion of the judge." &gt; In this case you could
        consider the flat part of the center corner to be a &gt; non functional
        part, because the inner part of the center is still in place. &gt; If
        the puzzle is unambiguously in a solved state, so only one of the center
        &gt; corners with this problem, then the puzzle should be considered
        solved. &gt; &gt; Looking forward to more competitions in 2006 in more
        countries, with even &gt; more fun. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron

        Regulation Revisions &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi ! &gt; &gt; That's more evidence
        to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It &gt; really is no problem
        timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due &gt; to (accidental) pop.
        And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not &gt; having to worry too much
        about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic &gt; is "out-debated". What
        happens will happen. Unless the WCA board &gt; decides that we gonna
        have a vote or something over it :-) &gt; &gt; I have written lots here
        about popping, but still my main concerns &gt; are that twisting centers
        should be allowed and also a single broken &gt; center (or any single
        cubie) as long as there is no ambiguity the &gt; cube/puzzle is solved.
        There is no way to benefit from those cube &gt; defects :-) &gt; &gt;

        You could calculate how much of your lifetime you've already wasted for
        cubing :-). And then argue that you haven't wasted enough because your
        goal is to reach every possible state. Imagine... - you could twist (the
        corner tips) with the speed of light - you'd twist your whole life
        (assume 100 years) - never visit a state twice so you don't waste time
        How much of the cube space would you visit? If I didn't make a mistake,
        it's about 35.7% which I think is a very nice number cause it's large
        enough to be graspable and doesn't reach 100%. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        This was an issue this year. I think it should be clarified for next
        year too (I have to check the WCA forum, maybe it's already been
        discussed there) Gilles. 2005/12/28, Anssi Vanhala

        friends, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think everything has been said now about
        extra attempt for pops. &gt; Thank you &gt; &gt; all for your input.
        &gt; &gt; There is still a majority favoring no extra attempts for pops,
        &gt; even for the &gt; &gt; bigger cubes. In return these cubers get 5
        instead of 3 attempts. &gt; &gt; Let us see what 2006 brings. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Stefan, for WC2003 there were no clear regulations about the
        &gt; cubing itself. &gt; &gt; Actually there were a few people (even
        finalists) getting extra &gt; attempts for &gt; &gt; having the last
        face not correctly aligned. On one occasion there &gt; was &gt; &gt;
        someone getting two extra attempts for the same cube. And each of &gt;
        the three &gt; &gt; scrambles was the same! There was also no limit for
        pops, so there &gt; was &gt; &gt; someone who had 3 pops, and received 3
        extra attempts. Another &gt; thing was &gt; &gt; that the regulations
        were very personal, one judge would react &gt; differently &gt; &gt;
        than another judge. &gt; &gt; We should be happy now that we have good
        regulations. :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; About the twisted center corner of
        Masayuki Akimoto. &gt; &gt; It is my mistake that the twisted center
        corner for Masayuki for &gt; his 5x5x5 &gt; &gt; attempt was not
        allowed. &gt; &gt; The judge came to me together with Masayuki, and
        asked me whether &gt; it was &gt; &gt; allowed or not. Even Masayuki
        said that he would not have a &gt; problem if it &gt; &gt; were not
        allowed. &gt; &gt; I was in doubt at that moment, so I should have
        checked the &gt; regulations. &gt; &gt; The regulations 2005 say: &gt;
        &gt; " &gt; &gt; All pieces of the puzzle must be ATTACHED to the puzzle
        for it to &gt; be solved. &gt; &gt; If a piece of the puzzle is EJECTED
        as the puzzle is placed down &gt; but it is &gt; &gt; otherwise solved,
        then the puzzle is not considered to be in a &gt; solved state. &gt;
        &gt; " &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The piece was attached, but ejected and not
        in solved position. &gt; Reading back &gt; &gt; now I think it should
        have been allowed. &gt; &gt; I am glad in the end it did not make much
        of a difference. &gt; Although I am not &gt; &gt; sure whether it was
        Masayuki's fastest time of the competition and &gt; thus a &gt; &gt;
        Japanese record. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My mistake. Sorry. Lesson learnt.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; About the center corner of 5x5x5 being broken. &gt;
        &gt; The regulations 2005 say: &gt; &gt; "If a non functional part of a
        puzzle is defect/ejected and the &gt; puzzle is &gt; &gt; still
        unambiguously in a solved state, then the puzzle is &gt; considered
        solved, &gt; &gt; under discretion of the judge." &gt; &gt; In this case
        you could consider the flat part of the center corner &gt; to be a &gt;
        &gt; non functional part, because the inner part of the center is still
        &gt; in place. &gt; &gt; If the puzzle is unambiguously in a solved
        state, so only one of &gt; the center &gt; &gt; corners with this
        problem, then the puzzle should be considered &gt; solved. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Looking forward to more competitions in 2006 in more
        countries, &gt; with even &gt; &gt; more fun. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have
        fun, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ron &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message

        &gt; That's more evidence to keep the current rule, allowing ONE pop. It
        &gt; &gt; really is no problem timewise to allow a few ppl one more
        solve due &gt; &gt; to (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more
        relaxed, not &gt; &gt; having to worry too much about pops. Anyway, i
        feel this topic &gt; &gt; is "out-debated". What happens will happen.
        Unless the WCA board &gt; &gt; decides that we gonna have a vote or
        something over it :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have written lots here about
        popping, but still my main concerns &gt; &gt; are that twisting centers
        should be allowed and also a single &gt; broken &gt; &gt; center (or any
        single cubie) as long as there is no ambiguity the &gt; &gt; cube/puzzle
        is solved. There is no way to benefit from those cube &gt; &gt; defects

        be nice :-). The more solves the better. &gt; &gt; Uh, &gt; &gt; &gt;
        except that more solves require fewer or faster competitors or &gt; &gt;
        fewer &gt; &gt; &gt; rounds... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        there were really no pops at all in the latest final, that &gt; &gt;

        about, at least for people in that &gt; level. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Yes, there really weren't any. And only 2 (declared) pops in the
        &gt; &gt; semi &gt; &gt; &gt; final, i.e. 2 pops in 182 solves (36
        competitors). Don't know &gt; &gt; about &gt; &gt; &gt; round 1, there
        are no pops but dnfs and they could mean anything. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Looking at the WC 2003 results, I don't see any pops at all.
        But &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; could imagine that the
        free-replacement-for-pops rule didn't &gt; exist &gt; &gt; &gt; back

        I agree, looking ahead is the most important thing for the largest part
        of the cube solution. I suggest you reach 20 seconds for F2L (cross
        included), then swith to 2-Look LL (or use a basic edge control). Then
        try to reach 15 seonds for the F2L, then improve your algs for the LL,
        then 10 seconds F2L, then sub5 for the LL, then you are one of the best

        This doesn't make the argument wrong. Yes, you can gain some knowledge
        this way and be more sure that changing would be better. But it doesn't
        make you win more often when changing. The probability for that stays at
        2/3. I knew a similar case as yours, but here's a really extreme one:
        After you pick your first door, the host opens *all* three doors and
        let's you stay or change. Even with this 100% knowledge (because you see
        the car), changing is successful exactly 2/3 of the time, namely in
        those cases where you were initially wrong. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        I don't believe that's true. You need precise finger muscles, and enough
        strength to turn the sides which depends on the stiffness of the cube. I
        do not really believe that anyone achieves strong fingers and wrist
        muscles as a result of cubing. You can get hurt, such as repetitive
        stress syndrome, but that doesn't mean you're strong. I think the racket
        hand of a badminton player could crush any of us. Wow, it's raining

        Come on, we're adding in all these things that basically require ESP or
        some other type of extra-human perception. Even if the host was right
        handed, it wouldn't make a difference. If you choose door 1, and the
        prize is behind door 2, and door 3 is 10 kilometers away from both you
        and the host, the host is going to have to run 10 kilometers to door 3
        because he can't possibly open door 2. (I think his goal, though, would
        be to run it in under 40 minutes.) Right-handed or left handed doesn't
        make a difference. Even if the host is trying to make you lose, he
        can't. He only has one choice of door to open if you select a door
        without a prize. Humans do not have any sense of selecting the right
        answer. If anyone wants to take a 1000 question multiple choice test
        right now, without knowing the questions, or the answers, I'll write a
        computer program right now. And I HATE programming. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        the theoretical assumtion (Pochmann apparently does) that the host has
        an "easy" door and a "difficult" door and he chooses the first with a

        It's a hilarious idea, but with the sad undertone that this discussion
        has even gone this far. The probability of winning the game if you
        switch the door is 2/3. We make several assumptions: No one is "out to
        get you." The host offers you the switch every single time. The host
        knows which door the prize is behind. Psychics are full of crap. Just
        play the game yourself. This "law of large numbers" not applying is
        false. Probability doesn't mean that something will or won't happen,
        it's how often it should happen. If we carry out an infinite number of
        tests, well, and I think it's called the central limit theorem but I'm
        not certain, the probabilities should even out to about 2/3 and 1/3. If
        you do it 1000 times, the probability will generally come out to 2/3 and
        1/3, but it won't be exact, and it could come out weird... you could win
        1000 times in a row. At the same time, I could tunnel through a brick
        wall. That's probability. Play the game yourself. Work out the
        probability, read the actual text of the problem as stated on that
        website, and if we can agree on the text of the problem, and the manner
        of which the game is played, there is no doubt that probability is 2/3
        and 1/3. There is no +epsilon or -epsilon because for the sake of a math
        problem, no one is right handed or left handed. No one has a preference,
        pure randomness is possible. Honestly, if you were playing the game,
        would you actually stay with the door you chose because you believe the
        probability of you winning is 1/2? If so, you deserve to lose that car.
        In fact, why don't we do this. I'll be the host of this game and I'll
        give you 100 trials. The prize behind the door in my game will be $5
        USD. Then, you be the host, and you give me 100 trials. The prize behind
        the door in your game is $4 USD. I'll switch the door every time, and
        you keep your door every time. If the probability is 1/2, I think you
        stand to make $50 USD in this game. Who's up for it? I'm putting up
        money here. Those who are convinced of their answer should step up. I'm
        convinced of my answer, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

        This doesn't make the argument wrong. Yes, you can gain some

        that changing would be better. But it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't make you
        win more often when changing. The probability for &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
        stays at 2/3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew a similar case as
        yours, but here's a really extreme one: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you pick your first door, the host opens *all* three
        doors and let's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you stay or change. Even with this 100%
        knowledge (because you see &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; car),
        changing is successful exactly 2/3 of the time, namely in
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cases where you were initially
        wrong. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stefan

        Hello Stafan many thanks for the centers explanation. and i was looking
        more in to this method. i came up with this: Building center + edges. I
        started playing with (Rr)' F (Rr) do the this alg and see what i mean:
        (Rr') F' (Rr) (rev. of the above) You see UB UF UR FL FD edges pairs. i
        solve the centers up to when i see that 3 centers needs to be placed.
        1th step: Look at UB edges then first im looking for UBr and place that
        in UFl and then UFr to the FDl and do (Rr)' F (Rr) Then 2 edge pairs are
        connected. and 2 centers to go. 2nd step: Looking at UB the first look
        at UBl and place the temporay in URb then look at UBr place that in UFl
        and then UFr to the FDl then FDr to the URf then i do L to set URb in
        place on FLu Then do (Rr)' F (Rr) Then 4 edge pairs are connected and 1
        center to go 3rd step: repeat step 2 Then 4 edge pairs are connected and
        centers done. and left with. 1 left with 3 edge pairs to connect 2 left
        with 2 edge pairs to connect 3 all edges solved 4 not run into any
        others yet and i have been trying this also with just step 1 repeated 3
        time's then 6 edges are done im much faster with this and maybe when you
        can do it 5 times then 10 edges are solved. but i think that will be
        harder but not tested yet. I think the first explanation is good for the
        people who used to the 6 edges method With this method you can start
        quicker to connecting edges. Greets Alexander Ooms i did not got any
        reaction on you mail from your page so i try this one

        didn't have time enough to play with your ideas. And hey, that was only
        two days ago or so, wasn't it? :-) Anyway, good idea at first look but
        I'll have to study it more... If you have good results, let us know.

        Yes, viscosity / weight are the same idea. Never tried a heavier weight.

        Hey, You're not pointing on me when you say "you", do you? I'm all with
        you (and pretty much the rest of the world) on this. I now my statistics
        and probabilities well. University well :) /Gustav Tyson Mao skrev:
        &gt;It's a hilarious idea, but with the sad undertone that this
        discussion &gt;has even gone this far. The probability of winning the
        game if you &gt;switch the door is 2/3. We make several assumptions:
        &gt; &gt;No one is "out to get you." &gt;The host offers you the switch
        every single time. &gt;The host knows which door the prize is behind.
        &gt;Psychics are full of crap. &gt; &gt;Just play the game yourself.
        This "law of large numbers" not applying &gt;is false. Probability
        doesn't mean that something will or won't &gt;happen, it's how often it
        should happen. If we carry out an infinite &gt;number of tests, well,
        and I think it's called the central limit &gt;theorem but I'm not
        certain, the probabilities should even out to about &gt;2/3 and 1/3. If
        you do it 1000 times, the probability will generally &gt;come out to 2/3
        and 1/3, but it won't be exact, and it could come out &gt;weird... you
        could win 1000 times in a row. At the same time, I could &gt;tunnel
        through a brick wall. That's probability. &gt; &gt;Play the game
        yourself. Work out the probability, read the actual text &gt;of the
        problem as stated on that website, and if we can agree on the &gt;text
        of the problem, and the manner of which the game is played, there &gt;is
        no doubt that probability is 2/3 and 1/3. There is no +epsilon or
        &gt;-epsilon because for the sake of a math problem, no one is right
        handed &gt;or left handed. No one has a preference, pure randomness is
        possible. &gt; &gt;Honestly, if you were playing the game, would you
        actually stay with &gt;the door you chose because you believe the
        probability of you winning &gt;is 1/2? If so, you deserve to lose that
        car. In fact, why don't we do &gt;this. I'll be the host of this game
        and I'll give you 100 trials. The &gt;prize behind the door in my game
        will be $5 USD. &gt; &gt;Then, you be the host, and you give me 100
        trials. The prize behind &gt;the door in your game is $4 USD. I'll
        switch the door every time, and &gt;you keep your door every time. If
        the probability is 1/2, I think you &gt;stand to make $50 USD in this
        game. Who's up for it? &gt; &gt;I'm putting up money here. Those who are
        convinced of their answer &gt;should step up. I'm convinced of my
        answer, and I'm putting my money &gt;where my mouth is. &gt; &gt;Tyson

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This doesn't make the argument wrong. Yes, you can
        gain some &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knowledge &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this way and
        be more sure that changing would be better. But it
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't make you win more often when changing. The
        probability for &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that stays at 2/3.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I knew a similar case as yours,
        but here's a really extreme one: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you pick your first door, the host opens *all* three
        doors and let's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you stay or change. Even with this
        100% knowledge (because you see &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;car), changing is successful exactly 2/3 of the
        time, namely in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cases

        The probability for &gt; &gt; that stays at 2/3. The probability that
        "change" wins the car stays at 2/3 and the probability for "keep" stays
        at 1/3. The extra knowledge doesn't help to make these strategies any
        better, "keep" wins if and only if your initial choice was correct (1/3)
        and "change" wins if and only if it was wrong (2/3). What you *can* do
        with this extra knowledge is make up a *better strategy* than those two.
        In my extreme example where you get to see the car, a good strategy
        would be "keep my door if and only if it contains the car". This *new*
        strategy wins the car 100% of the time. Now what about the situation you
        described? The game is the same but you get extra information from the
        behaviour of the host. Can you use it to make up a new strategy?
        Hmmmmm.... actually I just noticed something. Gotta think about it, will
        be back when I'm done with that. But I'm gonna submit the above now

        No, I'm not pointing to you. It's a general "you," though at this point,
        I'm surprised that no one has taken up my offer. Especially the people
        who claim that the probability is even at 1/2 and 1/2. At the end of
        this, I'll even give back the money that you lost if you concede that
        the probability is indeed 1/3 and 2/3. Look, there's no money lost here.
        I'm giving people who believe that the probability is 1/2 and 1/2 a risk
        free opportunity to prove themselves, and make a little money while
        they're at it if they're correct. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        hilarious idea, but with the sad undertone that this discussion &gt;&gt;
        has even gone this far. The probability of winning the game if you
        &gt;&gt; switch the door is 2/3. We make several assumptions: &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; No one is "out to get you." &gt;&gt; The host offers you the
        switch every single time. &gt;&gt; The host knows which door the prize
        is behind. &gt;&gt; Psychics are full of crap. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just
        play the game yourself. This "law of large numbers" not applying
        &gt;&gt; is false. Probability doesn't mean that something will or won't
        &gt;&gt; happen, it's how often it should happen. If we carry out an
        infinite &gt;&gt; number of tests, well, and I think it's called the
        central limit &gt;&gt; theorem but I'm not certain, the probabilities
        should even out to &gt;&gt; about &gt;&gt; 2/3 and 1/3. If you do it
        1000 times, the probability will generally &gt;&gt; come out to 2/3 and
        1/3, but it won't be exact, and it could come out &gt;&gt; weird... you
        could win 1000 times in a row. At the same time, I could &gt;&gt; tunnel
        through a brick wall. That's probability. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Play the
        game yourself. Work out the probability, read the actual &gt;&gt; text
        &gt;&gt; of the problem as stated on that website, and if we can agree
        on the &gt;&gt; text of the problem, and the manner of which the game is
        played, there &gt;&gt; is no doubt that probability is 2/3 and 1/3.
        There is no +epsilon or &gt;&gt; -epsilon because for the sake of a math
        problem, no one is right &gt;&gt; handed &gt;&gt; or left handed. No one
        has a preference, pure randomness is possible. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        Honestly, if you were playing the game, would you actually stay with
        &gt;&gt; the door you chose because you believe the probability of you
        winning &gt;&gt; is 1/2? If so, you deserve to lose that car. In fact,
        why don't we &gt;&gt; do &gt;&gt; this. I'll be the host of this game
        and I'll give you 100 trials. &gt;&gt; The &gt;&gt; prize behind the
        door in my game will be $5 USD. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Then, you be the host,
        and you give me 100 trials. The prize behind &gt;&gt; the door in your
        game is $4 USD. I'll switch the door every time, and &gt;&gt; you keep
        your door every time. If the probability is 1/2, I think you &gt;&gt;
        stand to make $50 USD in this game. Who's up for it? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        I'm putting up money here. Those who are convinced of their answer
        &gt;&gt; should step up. I'm convinced of my answer, and I'm putting my
        money &gt;&gt; where my mouth is. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tyson Mao &gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This doesn't make the argument wrong. Yes, you

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this way and be more sure that changing would
        be better. But it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't make you win more
        often when changing. The probability for &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
        stays at 2/3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew a
        similar case as yours, but here's a really extreme one:
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you pick your
        first door, the host opens *all* three doors and
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you stay or
        change. Even with this 100% knowledge (because you see
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; car), changing is
        successful exactly 2/3 of the time, namely in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        those &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cases where you were initially wrong.

        The 50 is "too fluid". I haven't used it very often yet but I think it
        drops out of the cube more easily, and I think it feels more "sticky".
        Wet your hands with water, press them against each other and slide them
        against each other. It actually makes it stiffer than when my hands are
        dry. Silicone oil just makes the sliding easier (I believe.. . I admit I
        never really tried that :-). Same with 50 vs 1000, the 50 gives me a
        more sticky feeling I think. What exactly does the "weight" value
        describe? It's certainly not the weight of the oil itself, my 1000
        weighs about the same as my 50, certainly not 20 times as much :-)

        I think one of the most important thing to point out to non cubers is
        that the cube is made up of the smaller "cubies" if you will. Alot of
        people think that each sticker can be moved individually. Another good
        one is the difference between orientation and permutation. Then, if you
        want to be really ambitious, you can try to explain commutators, but
        I've never found a good way to explain it in speech form, I always have
        to sit down and show someone. And you have to give them a website that
        they can visit to learn more about the cube. Just a couple of ideas,

        I remember at the 2004 us nationals it was quarter turn. I'm sure there
        is a reason for this, but I personally disagree (never happened to me, I
        just have different views). They way I think about it is that if we are

        &gt; Hi friends, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think everything has
        been said now about extra attempt for pops. &gt; &gt; Thank you &gt;
        &gt; &gt; all for your input. &gt; &gt; &gt; There is still a majority
        favoring no extra attempts for pops, &gt; &gt; even for the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; bigger cubes. In return these cubers get 5 instead of 3 attempts.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us see what 2006 brings. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Stefan, for WC2003 there were no clear regulations about the &gt;
        &gt; cubing itself. &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually there were a few people
        (even finalists) getting extra &gt; &gt; attempts for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        having the last face not correctly aligned. On one occasion there &gt;
        &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; someone getting two extra attempts for the same
        cube. And each of &gt; &gt; the three &gt; &gt; &gt; scrambles was the
        same! There was also no limit for pops, so there &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt;
        &gt; someone who had 3 pops, and received 3 extra attempts. Another &gt;
        &gt; thing was &gt; &gt; &gt; that the regulations were very personal,
        one judge would react &gt; &gt; differently &gt; &gt; &gt; than another
        judge. &gt; &gt; &gt; We should be happy now that we have good
        regulations. :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; About the twisted center
        corner of Masayuki Akimoto. &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my mistake that the
        twisted center corner for Masayuki for &gt; &gt; his 5x5x5 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; attempt was not allowed. &gt; &gt; &gt; The judge came to me
        together with Masayuki, and asked me whether &gt; &gt; it was &gt; &gt;
        &gt; allowed or not. Even Masayuki said that he would not have a &gt;
        &gt; problem if it &gt; &gt; &gt; were not allowed. &gt; &gt; &gt; I was
        in doubt at that moment, so I should have checked the &gt; &gt;
        regulations. &gt; &gt; &gt; The regulations 2005 say: &gt; &gt; &gt; "
        &gt; &gt; &gt; All pieces of the puzzle must be ATTACHED to the puzzle
        for it to &gt; &gt; be solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; If a piece of the puzzle
        is EJECTED as the puzzle is placed down &gt; &gt; but it is &gt; &gt;
        &gt; otherwise solved, then the puzzle is not considered to be in a &gt;
        &gt; solved state. &gt; &gt; &gt; " &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The
        piece was attached, but ejected and not in solved position. &gt; &gt;
        Reading back &gt; &gt; &gt; now I think it should have been allowed.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I am glad in the end it did not make much of a
        difference. &gt; &gt; Although I am not &gt; &gt; &gt; sure whether it
        was Masayuki's fastest time of the competition and &gt; &gt; thus a &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Japanese record. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My mistake.
        Sorry. Lesson learnt. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; About the center
        corner of 5x5x5 being broken. &gt; &gt; &gt; The regulations 2005 say:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; "If a non functional part of a puzzle is defect/ejected
        and the &gt; &gt; puzzle is &gt; &gt; &gt; still unambiguously in a
        solved state, then the puzzle is &gt; &gt; considered solved, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; under discretion of the judge." &gt; &gt; &gt; In this case you
        could consider the flat part of the center corner &gt; &gt; to be a &gt;
        &gt; &gt; non functional part, because the inner part of the center is
        still &gt; &gt; in place. &gt; &gt; &gt; If the puzzle is unambiguously
        in a solved state, so only one of &gt; &gt; the center &gt; &gt; &gt;
        corners with this problem, then the puzzle should be considered &gt;
        &gt; solved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looking forward to more
        competitions in 2006 in more countries, &gt; &gt; with even &gt; &gt;
        &gt; more fun. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Hi ! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's more evidence to keep the
        current rule, allowing ONE pop. It &gt; &gt; &gt; really is no problem
        timewise to allow a few ppl one more solve due &gt; &gt; &gt; to
        (accidental) pop. And ppl can cube faster more relaxed, not &gt; &gt;
        &gt; having to worry too much about pops. Anyway, i feel this topic &gt;
        &gt; &gt; is "out-debated". What happens will happen. Unless the WCA
        board &gt; &gt; &gt; decides that we gonna have a vote or something over
        it :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have written lots here about
        popping, but still my main concerns &gt; &gt; &gt; are that twisting
        centers should be allowed and also a single &gt; &gt; broken &gt; &gt;
        &gt; center (or any single cubie) as long as there is no ambiguity the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cube/puzzle is solved. There is no way to benefit from
        those cube &gt; &gt; &gt; defects :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, there really weren't any. And

        they could mean anything. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Looking at the WC 2003 results, I don't see any pops at all. But &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could imagine that the

        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It's a hilarious idea, but with the sad
        undertone that this discussion &gt;&gt;&gt;has even gone this far. The
        probability of winning the game if you &gt;&gt;&gt;switch the door is
        2/3. We make several assumptions: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;No one is
        "out to get you." &gt;&gt;&gt;The host offers you the switch every
        single time. &gt;&gt;&gt;The host knows which door the prize is behind.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;Psychics are full of crap. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Just
        play the game yourself. This "law of large numbers" not applying
        &gt;&gt;&gt;is false. Probability doesn't mean that something will or
        won't &gt;&gt;&gt;happen, it's how often it should happen. If we carry
        out an infinite &gt;&gt;&gt;number of tests, well, and I think it's
        called the central limit &gt;&gt;&gt;theorem but I'm not certain, the
        probabilities should even out to &gt;&gt;&gt;about &gt;&gt;&gt;2/3 and
        1/3. If you do it 1000 times, the probability will generally
        &gt;&gt;&gt;come out to 2/3 and 1/3, but it won't be exact, and it could
        come out &gt;&gt;&gt;weird... you could win 1000 times in a row. At the
        same time, I could &gt;&gt;&gt;tunnel through a brick wall. That's
        probability. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Play the game yourself. Work out
        the probability, read the actual &gt;&gt;&gt;text &gt;&gt;&gt;of the
        problem as stated on that website, and if we can agree on the
        &gt;&gt;&gt;text of the problem, and the manner of which the game is
        played, there &gt;&gt;&gt;is no doubt that probability is 2/3 and 1/3.
        There is no +epsilon or &gt;&gt;&gt;-epsilon because for the sake of a
        math problem, no one is right &gt;&gt;&gt;handed &gt;&gt;&gt;or left
        handed. No one has a preference, pure randomness is possible.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Honestly, if you were playing the game, would
        you actually stay with &gt;&gt;&gt;the door you chose because you
        believe the probability of you winning &gt;&gt;&gt;is 1/2? If so, you
        deserve to lose that car. In fact, why don't we &gt;&gt;&gt;do
        &gt;&gt;&gt;this. I'll be the host of this game and I'll give you 100
        trials. &gt;&gt;&gt;The &gt;&gt;&gt;prize behind the door in my game
        will be $5 USD. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Then, you be the host, and you
        give me 100 trials. The prize behind &gt;&gt;&gt;the door in your game
        is $4 USD. I'll switch the door every time, and &gt;&gt;&gt;you keep
        your door every time. If the probability is 1/2, I think you
        &gt;&gt;&gt;stand to make $50 USD in this game. Who's up for it?
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm putting up money here. Those who are
        convinced of their answer &gt;&gt;&gt;should step up. I'm convinced of
        my answer, and I'm putting my money &gt;&gt;&gt;where my mouth is.

        whithout this knowledge and then bettered it,

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;before the first choise, *I* am discussing the
        probabilities before &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the second choice, that is,
        when the host has opened one door. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is some concensus here that the probabilities
        are 1/3 or 2/3. But &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we accept the theoretical assumtion (Pochmann
        apparently does) that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the host has an "easy"
        door and a "difficult" door and he chooses &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;first with a probability of 1/2 + epsilon and
        the second with a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probability 1/2 - epsilon
        (epsilon not 0), the result will be &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ask mister Pochmann to calculate the
        probabilities for you. Mister &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bayes may help
        him. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;R &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;----- Original

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This doesn't make the argument wrong. Yes,
        you can gain some &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knowledge
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this way and be more sure that changing
        would be better. But it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't make you win
        more often when changing. The probability for
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that stays at 2/3.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I knew a
        similar case as yours, but here's a really extreme one:
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you pick
        your first door, the host opens *all* three doors and
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;let's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you stay
        or change. Even with this 100% knowledge (because you see
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;car),
        changing is successful exactly 2/3 of the time, namely in
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;cases
        where you were initially wrong. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        Ok, I'm done. With this idea of gaining extra information (i.e. not like
        in the original pure probability riddle) I'm not sure we should talk
        about *the* probability that changing or keeping your door wins a
        certain fraction of all cases. That's because now it depends on your
        strategy. For simplicity, let's consider my extreme hint example again
        where you *know* where the car is before your second decision. The
        probability for something is roughly speaking the good events divided by
        all events. Now if your strategy is "keep if and only if I was right"
        then you always win. That is, all your "change" decisions and all your
        "keep" decisions will win. Instead of 2/3 and 1/3 we now have 3/3 and
        3/3. However, if your strategy is "keep if and only if I was wrong" then
        we drop to 0/3 and 0/3. So it depends on your strategy and thus speaking
        about *the* probability for keep/change doesn't make much sense, at
        least not directly. I guess this term could make sense if you define it
        over *all strategies*, and then it might be 2/3 and 1/3 again, but I
        won't dare to claim that cause now it's getting too complicated :-) If
        we talk about keep/change as strategies, short for "I'll always keep my
        door" (or "change"), then 2/3 and 1/3 is correct. It's also correct if
        your choice is random. Or if you always alternate between keep/change
        (unless the correct door alternates accordingly). Or other constructions
        that keep the 2/3 vs 1/3 probabilities for keep vs change. But inside
        other strategies, the probabilities can be very very different. Cheers!

        He is contradicting himself when saying: &gt; "you can gain some
        knowledge this way and be more sure that changing &gt; would be
        better...but... the probability stays at 2/3". But if we had &gt; a
        probability of 2/3 whithout this knowledge and then bettered it, how
        &gt; can we still stay at 2/3? &gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe, you better don't
        remove the important parts of the quote :-). I &gt; was talking about
        two different things. I said: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can gain some
        knowledge &gt; &gt; &gt; this way and be more sure that changing would
        be better. But it &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't make you win more often when
        changing. The probability for &gt; &gt; &gt; that stays at 2/3. &gt;
        &gt; The probability that "change" wins the car stays at 2/3 and the
        &gt; probability for "keep" stays at 1/3. The extra knowledge doesn't
        help &gt; to make these strategies any better, "keep" wins if and only
        if your &gt; initial choice was correct (1/3) and "change" wins if and
        only if it &gt; was wrong (2/3). &gt; &gt; What you *can* do with this
        extra knowledge is make up a *better &gt; strategy* than those two. In
        my extreme example where you get to see &gt; the car, a good strategy
        would be "keep my door if and only if it &gt; contains the car". This
        *new* strategy wins the car 100% of the time. &gt; &gt; Now what about
        the situation you described? The game is the same but &gt; you get extra
        information from the behaviour of the host. Can you use &gt; it to make
        up a new strategy? &gt; &gt; Hmmmmm.... actually I just noticed
        something. Gotta think about it, &gt; will be back when I'm done with
        that. But I'm gonna submit the above &gt; now anyway. &gt; &gt; Cheers!

        of building edges together with centers, but I gave up on it real quick
        because I kept destroying my edge pairs, or it was too much work to keep
        them intact. Looks like I should try again... &gt; 3rd step: &gt; repeat
        step 2 &gt; Then 4 edge pairs are connected &gt; and centers done. Is
        this a type or are really only 4 pairs connected, not 6? &gt; and i have
        been trying this also with just step 1 repeated 3 time's &gt; then 6
        edges are done Can you point out more how your above method differs from
        just doing step 1 three times? Btw, how have you been connecting edges
        so far? I use to build two pairs at a time, using algs like r' U' R U r.

        I'll be the host of this game and I'll give you 100 trials. The &gt;

        your game is $4 USD. I'll switch the door every time, and &gt; you keep
        your door every time. If the probability is 1/2, I think you &gt; stand
        to make $50 USD in this game. Who's up for it? For some reason too
        difficult to explain here (but you can read it in the book of Baltalan
        and Leeves) I don't think this is fair. We must play at the same time.
        For this, I suggest the following procedure (it's basically the same
        game but initially with two players): We need a third person who'll be
        the host and you give him your $5 and I give him my $4. He places the $9
        behind one of three doors. We both choose a door. If it's the same we
        try again until we choose different ones. Then, only one of us can
        continue the game. The host opens an empty door, either yours or mine.
        The one who had this door is out, the other can choose to keep his door
        or change to the third door (which none of us chose). If the wrong door
        is chosen, we try again (playing for the same $9). We do this 10 times
        and you always switch and I always keep. Ok? Cheers! Stefan

        Hey All, I am currently learning the algorithms (BigCubes.com) for
        solving the last Edges for the Professor Cube, but came across a snag.
        Two of the algs on the page are incorrect and I've also found that there
        are more than the nine cases provided on the page. I managed to solve
        the error in one of the algs (top row third from left) although the
        other algorithm is too complex for me. Can anyone solve the case
        correcting the provided algorithm: second row third from the left? And
        does anyone know how many cases there are? I've come across 11 so far (2
        more than the site) This is the direct link to the above discussed page:

        URf &gt; &gt; then i do L to set URb in place on FLu Then do (Rr)' F
        (Rr) &gt; &gt; Then 4 edge pairs are connected &gt; &gt; and 1 center to
        go &gt; &gt; This confuses me... I think you're trying to somehow keep
        the edge &gt; pairs you built in the 1st step intact, is that right?
        Actually a &gt; while ago I had this idea of building edges together
        with centers, but &gt; I gave up on it real quick because I kept
        destroying my edge pairs, or &gt; it was too much work to keep them
        intact. Looks like I should try &gt; again... &gt; You have to watch
        what happen when you do (Rr)' F (Rr) The ones that are destroyed or
        build is UB UF UR FL FD so when you just do step 1 you have to watch UR
        and FL &gt; &gt; 3rd step: &gt; &gt; repeat step 2 &gt; &gt; Then 4 edge
        pairs are connected &gt; &gt; and centers done. &gt; &gt; Is this a type
        or are really only 4 pairs connected, not 6? &gt; with this alg its only
        possible to connect 5 edges with luck &gt; &gt; and i have been trying
        this also with just step 1 repeated 3 time's &gt; &gt; then 6 edges are
        done &gt; &gt; Can you point out more how your above method differs from
        just doing &gt; step 1 three times? &gt; when doing the 1step then step
        2 and 3: 1st: 2 edges correct 2nd: 4 edges corrert total 6 3th: 4 egdes
        correct total 9 or 10 or 12 But doing this its hard for me its kinda
        like the 6 edge method &gt; Btw, how have you been connecting edges so
        far? I use to build two &gt; pairs at a time, using algs like r' U' R U
        r. yes the 2 edge method i use normale &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan
        &gt; all this can be done with (Ll) F' (Ll)' but then its all mirrored
        :) greets AO

        They could accidently line up and the computer contestent could choose

        &gt;&gt;&gt; I did the experiment and reported the result. If the result

        Thanks Stefan, Weight is a term describing viscosity. The smaller the
        weithg number the lower the viscosity. The higher the weight the greater
        the viscosity. Just another unit of measure as far as I know. I'll get
        some higher weight lube and try it out. Thanks, Eric --- In

        &gt; Haven't we had this dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing
        &gt; group? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The game is set up so that if
        you switch, a winning choice would &gt; &gt; &gt; become a losing choice
        and vice versa. In the beginning you had a 1/3 &gt; &gt; &gt; chance of
        winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will always be able
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; show you a door with nothing behind it no matter which
        door you &gt; &gt; &gt; picked), but switching will turn your
        probabability of winning to 2/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If my
        explanation makes no sense, consider the situation with 100 &gt; &gt;
        &gt; doors and one door with a prize. You pick a door, and the host
        shows &gt; &gt; &gt; you 98 doors with nothing behind them. Now it's
        much more obvious that &gt; &gt; &gt; you should switch, right? &gt;

        He opens an empty door. Then, he makes a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question:
        do you want to continue with your first choice or &gt; change to &gt;

        In order to appease Stefan, I propose we play the game this way: I put
        in $5, and you put in $4. The combined $9 is put behind one of the three
        doors (or cups, or whatever). I'll let you choose the door. You choose
        the door, someone reveals a door without the money (that's not the door
        you chose). If the $9 is behind the original door you chose, you keep
        the money. If it's behind the other door, I'll keep the money. We repeat
        this 100 times. I'm not arguing the probabilities of this game anymore.
        Here's the game. Do you want to play? If indeed the answer is 1/2, 1/2,
        then you'll win $50. If you have ESP and can perceive things, then
        you'll win money. I'm prepared to part with up to $500 for this game.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Haven't we had this
        dicussion before? Or was it in another cubing &gt;&gt; group?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The game is set up so that if you
        switch, a winning choice would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; become a losing choice
        and vice versa. In the beginning you had &gt; a 1/3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        chance of winning and 2/3 chance of losing. Staying with your choice
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't change your odds of winning (the host will
        always be able to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show you a door with nothing behind
        it no matter which door you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; picked), but switching will
        turn your probabability of winning &gt; to 2/3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my explanation makes no sense, consider the
        situation with 100 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doors and one door with a prize. You
        pick a door, and the host shows &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you 98 doors with
        nothing behind them. Now it's much more &gt; obvious that
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you should switch, right? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        you to choose a door. So, you choose, but he &gt; doesn't
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; open your choosen door. He opens an empty door.
        Then, he makes a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question: do you want to continue

        No, I don't guarantee that everyone who keeps the same door will be
        wrong 2/3rds of the time. I know that if we carry this out to a large
        number, such as 100, that it is pretty much guaranteed that they will be
        wrong about 2/3rds of the time. That's what probability is. The game
        will be won if the contestant switches doors 2/3rds of the time is
        calculated by the following: (1/3)(1/3) + (2/3)(2/3) = 5/9 The
        contestant will win 5 out of 9 times. Bob's computer simulation shows
        that switching the door will win twice as often as not switching the
        door. That's 2/3 and 1/3 probability. A quick look a Bob's simulation
        shows, by calculation as I did earlier, that the overall outcome of 1/2
        switch and 1/2 not switching should be 1/2. His experiment confirms
        exactly what we were looking for. I've already stated over and over
        again. If you believe that a person will win 1/2 of the time by not
        switching, then play my game. I'll even up the stakes if you want to
        make more money off of me. I could give you arguments all day, but I'm
        not. It's simple, will you play my game? Will you challenge my answer?
        Unless there is some flawed mechanism of how I set up the game, prove to

        Just to argue a bit more in this thread (which is very silly) I have a
        couple of questions: Are you suggesting that I still have 1/3, 2/3 (any
        way) when choosing at random or always alternating between
        staying/switching? If you did that should read 1/2, 1/2. /Gustav Stefan

        information (i.e. not &gt;like in the original pure probability riddle)
        I'm not sure we should &gt;talk about *the* probability that changing or
        keeping your door wins a &gt;certain fraction of all cases. &gt;
        &gt;That's because now it depends on your strategy. For simplicity,
        let's &gt;consider my extreme hint example again where you *know* where
        the car &gt;is before your second decision. The probability for
        something is &gt;roughly speaking the good events divided by all events.
        Now if your &gt;strategy is "keep if and only if I was right" then you
        always win. &gt;That is, all your "change" decisions and all your "keep"
        decisions &gt;will win. Instead of 2/3 and 1/3 we now have 3/3 and 3/3.
        However, if &gt;your strategy is "keep if and only if I was wrong" then
        we drop to 0/3 &gt;and 0/3. &gt; &gt;So it depends on your strategy and
        thus speaking about *the* &gt;probability for keep/change doesn't make
        much sense, at least not &gt;directly. I guess this term could make
        sense if you define it over &gt;*all strategies*, and then it might be
        2/3 and 1/3 again, but I won't &gt;dare to claim that cause now it's
        getting too complicated :-) &gt; &gt;If we talk about keep/change as
        strategies, short for "I'll always &gt;keep my door" (or "change"), then
        2/3 and 1/3 is correct. It's also &gt;correct if your choice is random.
        Or if you always alternate between &gt;keep/change (unless the correct
        door alternates accordingly). Or other &gt;constructions that keep the
        2/3 vs 1/3 probabilities for keep vs &gt;change. But inside other
        strategies, the probabilities can be very &gt;very different. &gt;

        important parts of the quote :-). &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;was talking about two different things. I said: &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, you can gain some knowledge
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this way and be more sure that changing would be better.
        But it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't make you win more often when changing.
        The probability &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;for &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that stays at 2/3. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;The probability that "change" wins the car stays at 2/3 and the
        &gt;&gt;probability for "keep" stays at 1/3. The extra knowledge doesn't
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;help &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to make these strategies
        any better, "keep" wins if and only if your &gt;&gt;initial choice was
        correct (1/3) and "change" wins if and only if it &gt;&gt;was wrong
        (2/3). &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;What you *can* do with this extra knowledge is
        make up a *better &gt;&gt;strategy* than those two. In my extreme
        example where you get to see &gt;&gt;the car, a good strategy would be
        "keep my door if and only if it &gt;&gt;contains the car". This *new*
        strategy wins the car 100% of the &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;time. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;Now what about the situation you described? The game is the same
        but &gt;&gt;you get extra information from the behaviour of the host.
        Can you &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;use &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it to make up a new
        strategy? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Hmmmmm.... actually I just noticed something.
        Gotta think about it, &gt;&gt;will be back when I'm done with that. But
        I'm gonna submit the above &gt;&gt;now anyway. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Cheers!

        Hi frens, I was the guy from Malaysia who posted 3 months ago about his
        first sub- 30 average. Well, I reached another personal milestone today
        with my first non-lucky sub-20 time (19.61 secs)! YES! My next goal is
        to do a sub-20 average. My current best avg from 1.5 months back is
        26.00 secs. That was mainly done with a 3-look LL. I'm learning OLL
        right now and knows about 80% of the algorithms at this moment. My
        non-lucky sub-20 time was done with a 2-look LL. I'll start taking
        averages again once I'm done with all the OLL algo's. Thanks a lot to
        the cubing community for sharing ideas and algo's. I'm on a working
        assigment in the United States (California) right now and looking
        forward to the Exploratorium competition in January. I won't be
        competing but I'm eager to meet up with some you guys. Cheers, Meng

        Well I got some of the 80 weight, and I like it. My fear was that the
        heavier weights would be too thick and gunky. But it's not like that at
        all. It's almost a gel consistency, like Stefan described. It's also

        I haven't used it very often yet but I think it &gt; &gt; drops out of
        the cube more easily, and I think it feels more "sticky". &gt; &gt; Wet
        your hands with water, press them against each other and slide &gt; &gt;
        them against each other. It actually makes it stiffer than when my &gt;
        &gt; hands are dry. Silicone oil just makes the sliding easier (I
        believe.. &gt; &gt; . I admit I never really tried that :-). Same with
        50 vs 1000, the 50 &gt; &gt; gives me a more sticky feeling I think.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What exactly does the "weight" value describe? It's
        certainly not the &gt; &gt; weight of the oil itself, my 1000 weighs
        about the same as my 50, &gt; &gt; certainly not 20 times as much :-)

        advocate ESP and the like if they attack completely honest and
        professional Mr Rhine? What a bad world this is... Cheers! Stefan P.S.

        of 100 &gt; &gt; "games" I "won the car" 76 times. &gt; Hello David,
        Yes, I would also like to see your program and learn from it. You have
        put so much effort into making sure everything is done like it has to be
        done, I think it would be a waste to not show it. Thank you, Stefan

        If you have a 1/3 probability of winning each time, and out of 100
        trials you won 76, the probability of that happening is:
        (1/3)^76*(2/3)^24*(100 nCr 76) Where 100 nCr 76 is 100 choose 76. I
        think that's correct, but I might be wrong, but of course, that number
        is definitely really small. Let's compete the probability that someone
        can win 76 or more times. Sum(i=76 to 100): (1/3)^i*(2/3)^(100-i)*(100
        nCr i) Using Mathematica, I got 3*10^(-18). With that type of

        You can actually buy 2 different 5x5x5 cubes at Mefferts. Theres the

        nice as a Rubiks 5x5x5. The other is the Tiled Mefferts Professor which
        is exactly the same as a Rubiks 5x just with Tiles instead of stickers.
        Neither puzzle uses B.O.Y color scheme. The 4x4x4 at Mefferts is an

        that case 2nd row last one, i do it like this, with the tredges at FL

        drew there is acutally case # 2, but the tredge has been flipped upside

        other, i place them two slots away (like i would first do R2 x2 on your
        example)and do the same thing as case 1 and 2 except the first and last
        move are 1/2 turns instead of 1/4. i don't know if that makes sense but
        if you do an R2, you should see how its the same case as number 2 but it
        is an extra slot away. the second example is also a similar situation,
        its acutally #7 but a tredge is flipped upside down, you can remove it

        Ya Evan is right. Most ppl dont have the concept of "cubies". Explain
        that surely to the kids. Also what i try to do when explaining to others
        is the abstract concept as to why any algorithm works. I say that if u
        do a move say X and then Y and then if u reverse the moves, like X Y Y'
        X', then nothing will happen to the cube. But if u undo the first move
        first then u get somethign like X Y X' Y' and this changes the state of
        the cube. Ofcourse dont use the ""X" nad "Y" during ur talk or u'll
        confuse the kids. And surely if the kids are bright then try to touch
        upon the concept of commutators. From what i have seen, it surely is a
        little tough at first making ppl understand commutators but once thats
        done its easy to explain the whole last layer. Also show different
        shapes on the cubes to entertain the kids..or maybe teach them how to
        get to the patterns from a solved cube and make them do it. It'll be a
        sort of hands-on for them and they'll surely get interested. Keep us
        informed how the tutorials go :) Sachin. On 12/29/05, Evan Gates

        right. Most ppl dont have the concept of "cubies". Explain &gt; that
        surely to the kids. &gt; &gt; Also what i try to do when explaining to
        others is the abstract &gt; concept as to why any algorithm works. I say
        that if u do a move say X &gt; and then Y and then if u reverse the
        moves, like X Y Y' X', then &gt; nothing will happen to the cube. But if
        u undo the first move first &gt; then u get somethign like X Y X' Y' and
        this changes the state of the &gt; cube. Ofcourse dont use the ""X" nad
        "Y" during ur talk or u'll &gt; confuse the kids. &gt; &gt; And surely
        if the kids are bright then try to touch upon the concept &gt; of
        commutators. From what i have seen, it surely is a little tough at &gt;
        first making ppl understand commutators but once thats done its easy
        &gt; to explain the whole last layer. &gt; &gt; Also show different
        shapes on the cubes to entertain the kids..or &gt; maybe teach them how
        to get to the patterns from a solved cube and &gt; make them do it.
        It'll be a sort of hands-on for them and they'll &gt; surely get
        interested. &gt; &gt; Keep us informed how the tutorials go :) &gt; &gt;

        indeed supposed to be true. My claim was that switching results in a win

        of the time. Instead, my results were 64% and 32% respectively (sorry, I
        was off by 2.7% and 1.3%). Of course, with a "random" strategy
        (switching half the time and keeping your choice half the time), you
        should win (1/3)*(1/2) + (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/2 of the time. ~ Bob

        Here I beat you; I have Three silicone oils, one with the viscosity 100

        second is the best one, but the third is almost as good. The viscosity
        is measured in "stokes", evidently an old measure and I can¬¥t find any

        Hey everybody, This might be old news, but I found a way to make my
        H-permutation faster... I never really liked the H-permutation, but now
        it's ok... Some of you will still beat me, though.. I was inspired by
        Bob Burton, who does the M2' with his (left) middle and ring finger. I
        now do it with my middle finger, starting with the tip of my finger at
        the UB edge sticker. However, it's really awkward to do M2' that way...
        So I actually start with an L, then place my finger, and do L(L'M2') at
        the same time. So the alg becomes: L(L'M2') U L(L'M2') U2 L(L'M2')U
        L(L'M2') Ok, I know it looks ugly, but it's just a way of writing it to
        show how I execute it :). I don't have a webcam here (I am at my parents
        house), but I'll make a video soon. See you! Jo√´l.

        All you losers still don't understand what David has explained. Humans
        are no computers, we have special mind powers defying the odds of
        probability! If you can't grasp that, it's not our (David and me)
        problem. Of course like many things, you have to believe in it,
        otherwise it won't work. That's why Bob only got 16 out of 50 with the
        same strategy that allowed David to get 76 out of 100. At least that's
        my explanation as ESP novice, David please correct if it's wrong. David,
        I'm very sorry about all this. I wish we had more mature folks here. But
        the way it is, I think maybe you better try your luck elsewhere. Cheers!

        Hehe, I didn't click on anything but "how did I do", and I got this :
        You got 33 correct never switching. (for my 2 millions attemps (1
        million each), I used a program that could generate 1000 games at a
        time... so I guess I just clicked 2000 times lol) 2005/12/29, c_w_tsai

        you didn't click something 2000000 times, right? You let it play &gt; by
        itself? &gt; &gt; I did my little thing so that a person could play - so
        this claim &gt; wouldn't apply: &gt; "They [the random number generator]
        could accidently line up and the &gt; computer contestent could choose
        correctly 100% of the time, and &gt; switching 100% of the time it would
        lose 100% of the time." &gt; &gt; And the answers are at the bottom in
        case you would like to check &gt; them out. All predetermined - so that
        you can't say that your &gt; guesses are somehow affecting which door I
        put the car behind for &gt; the next game. &gt; &gt; And it doesn't ask
        whether you want to switch each time... to take &gt; care of this claim:
        &gt; "If the computer takes longer to ask you if you want to switch
        after &gt; you chose correctly this could be perceived, consciously or
        &gt; unconsciously, and affect your choice." &gt; &gt; If you want,
        choose your strategy after your guesses... The answers &gt; are still at
        the bottom and they still haven't changed. &gt; &gt; David, please play

        include the regrip for the x at the end, with that it's 1.77 seconds. I
        had also found another nice way for this OLL case: R' U' F R' F' R F U R
        U' R' F' R This might actually be faster for me, but I noticed I get
        confused and make mistakes because I'm using this alg for your case 23:
        R' U' F U R U' R' F' R That's the same but without a (R' F' R F) in the
        middle. You're using the same alg, just from a different angle: (L' d')
        (R d) (L U') (r' U' r) Adding (B' R' B R) at the appropriate place gives
        you this alternative alg for case 49: (L' d') (R (B' R' B R) d) (L U')
        (r' U' r) Since you do your OLL 23 in 1.60 and your OLL 49 in 3.10, all
        you have to do is those extra four moves in less than 1.50 ;-) Cheers!

        Hey Everyone, I was just curious what the reaction times of people were.
        Try this game: http://www.fingertime.com/bullettime.php I'm not so
        great. My best so far is 194 ms and I'm usually around 230 to 250 ms.
        I'm sure there are some people here who can get around 150 ms. Tyson Mao

        All - 25 years ago, when I was a young cuber, I bought a solution poster
        and tacked it to the door of my room. My mom has been cleaning out the
        house, and for christmas took the old poster off the door, patched it
        up, laminated it and mailed it to me! It's an interesting solution -
        edges first (top layer edges, middle layer edges, bottom edge permute
        then orient), then corners (place front, place back, orient right,
        orient left). The solution is entirely built from commutators, using
        certain commutators for different steps. The solution is credited to:
        "Jeffrey Adams, who has a PhD in mathematics (Lie Groups) from Yale
        University" with "Many thanks are owed to Matthew and Tevin Abeshouse,
        who did the design and graphics for this poster, and to Don Kersey, with
        whom most of this material was discovered." I'll bring it along to the
        Exploratorium contest and maybe we can get some posterboard and put it
        up on a stand somewhere for people to check out. see you in San
        Francisco! yeff

        For me, I seem to be averaging around 200ms, with a fastest of 180-
        something. I lasted until I had to react in 200ms - just a tad too slow
        on that one. The trick seems to be figuring out how to react to the

        I think the people with ridiculous scores cheat. Anyway, to bring this
        to cubing, do you think a fast reaction time helps with case recognition
        while solving the cube? Generally, we should be looking ahead so that we
        know what's coming... but sometimes you do a really fast OLL and you're
        hit with a 3-cycle that's facing right at you with the correct face. Is
        it costing us 200 ms to decide clockwise or counter-clockwise, does it
        take more time than that because we have to recognize something more
        complex? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Dec

        Hey folks Well, I know this is not very fast, many of you can average
        faster than this, but I'm happy to announce that I made my first sub-16s
        solve! The time was 15.78s, with this scramble: F' D F2 D2 R2 L U F2 D B
        R' L D L B U L U' L U' F' B2 L R F' My solution was like this: Cross:
        (y') F' D' R' D' R' (5) 1st pair: (y) U L' U L U (y) L' U L (8) 2nd
        pair: (y2) R U' R' (y) U' L' U L (7) 3rd pair: (y) L' U2 L U' L' U L (7)
        4th pair: U' R U' R' (4) OLL: (y') R U x' R U' R' U x U' R' (8) PLL: (U)
        R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F' (14) Total: 53 moves in 15.78
        seconds = ~3.36moves/second I know, I know, too many cube rotations...I
        have to work on that...but that slve was GOOD! : ) Pedro

        I think so. On that game, you just have to see the bullet or hear the
        sound and click the mouse. On cubing, you have to see a pattern (between
        A LOT of them) and decide which alg to use (that also is not just one
        move). But I think people with good reflexes are good on cubing. Pedro

        Ouch, looks like my reactions between 300 and 350 aren't too exciting
        :-) And don't remember me of edge 3-cycles... I can execute them fast,
        but when deciding which direction to go, my right hand is often
        literally shaking back and forth. That's because I start by regripping
        with my right hand either like R or like R'. Gotta find two algs that
        start the same... Cheers! STefan --- In

        &gt; Anyway, to bring this to cubing, do you think a fast reaction time
        &gt; helps with case recognition while solving the cube? Generally, we
        &gt; should be looking ahead so that we know what's coming... but
        sometimes &gt; you do a really fast OLL and you're hit with a 3-cycle
        that's facing &gt; right at you with the correct face. Is it costing us
        200 ms to decide &gt; clockwise or counter-clockwise, does it take more
        time than that &gt; because we have to recognize something more complex?

        It's intersting that there are so many vatiations of M2 rR' rR' r2 R2'
        M' M' (with ring finger) M2' (with ring and middle) L(LM2) r(R'M') I
        have used all of the above mentioned methods for M2, pretty much in the
        order described. The way I do it is very close to your way. But instead
        of doing L, I do r, bringing the UB edge down to DB. Then I just do a M'
        with my left ring finger as do R' with my Right hand. Everything is the

        &gt; Some of you will still beat me, though.. &gt; &gt; I was inspired

        finger, and do L(L'M2') at the same time. So the alg &gt; becomes: &gt;
        &gt; L(L'M2') U L(L'M2') U2 L(L'M2')U L(L'M2') &gt; &gt; Ok, I know it

        I made it to level 16 but ended up with 0 as score. Damn penalties for

        if you're after the 3x3 world record, I suggest you put down the cube
        and stop the timer right after OLL! This will work in 1 out of 288
        cases, not bad! You can use this in official competitions, and if you

        1. Poker Cube This cube had a sticker for each card in a deck. 9
        facelets x 6 sides = 54 stickers. 13 cards x 4 suits + 2 jokers = 54
        cards in a deck. IT comes with little dice, and instructions on how to
        play. I don't think that it has a solved state, the cube is used in the
        game to produce randomness. 2. K-Ball a very interesting spherical
        puzzle. Its basically a 2x2; a sphere divided into 8 parts, with colored
        rings on the surface of the sphere. The Interesting part is that each of
        the colors have different Braille (spelling?) symbols. You can do this
        blindfolded with no memorization, if you can recognize the symbols. OFF
        TOPIC Does anyone know Braille? Does anyone know sign language I have
        taken 1 semester of sign language. It's very interesting to learn. Happy

        little cubes. The first thing I do when I teach people is to take it
        apart and show that it's in actual fact made of 8 corners, 12 edges, and
        one big center piece. This shows you can't move stickers independently,
        and also that centers will never move relative to each other. /Lars - -

        Hey Pedro, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That trophy looks authentic. Do the glass
        trophies come with a Rubik's &gt; &gt; Cube stand? Mine is still in its
        box so I'm not quite sure. I don't &gt; &gt; think they come with a
        stand though... but I'm sure other people will &gt; &gt; be able to
        correct me if I'm wrong. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who's the seller? &gt; &gt;

        All this simulation isn't very much in the way of proof, is it? It's
        much quicker (and more formal and not empirical) to use conditional
        probability to get the result. Initially, you select the correct door
        with probability 1/3. If you are correct, switching is guaranteed to
        fail, sticking is guaranteed to win. If you are incorrect, switching is
        guaranteed to succeed, sticking is guaranteed to fail. (Heuristically,
        in the less probable case switching fails and in the more probable case
        switching succeeds. We can be more formal as follows:) P(Win if switch)
        =P(Win if switch|first guess is correct)*P(first guess is correct)+P
        (Win if switch|first guess is incorrect)*P(first guess is incorrect)
        =0*1/3+1*2/3=2/3. P(Win if stick) =P(Win if stick|first guess is
        correct))*P(first guess is correct)+P (Win if stick|first guess is
        incorrect)*P(first guess is incorrect) =1*1/3+0*2/3=1/3.

        The highscore is 2147483647 which is 2 ** 31 - 1. This is probably the
        highest possible value for that field in the DB where the highscore data
        is stored. My guess is that they somehow either triggered a bug in the

        &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents. &gt; &gt; Terje &gt; &gt; p.s. I'm getting
        down to average times in the 120 - 130 ms range now. My &gt; "trick" is
        to close my eyes and just listen for the sound. when I used &gt; my eyes
        i was stuck around 160. &gt; &gt; -----Opprinnelig melding----- &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; So if you're after the 3x3 world record, I suggest you
        put down &gt; the &gt; &gt; cube and stop the timer right after OLL!
        This will work in 1 out &gt; of &gt; &gt; 288 cases, not bad! You can
        use this in official competitions, and &gt; if &gt; &gt; you declare
        this to be your standard method, you can even use it &gt; for &gt; &gt;
        the UWR lists, since you're not skipping a step of your method. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw, for that bullet game your hardware matters. I got
        mostly &gt; under &gt; &gt; 200 (and 157 best) when using a real mouse,
        and mostly over 300 &gt; when &gt; &gt; using the "mouse button" on my
        laptop itself (in front of the &gt; &gt; touchpad). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; around &gt; &gt; 230 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to 250 ms. I'm sure there

        We've done it this way too previously. But some people don't get it

        &gt; &gt;Initially, you select the correct door with probability 1/3.
        &gt;If you are correct, switching is guaranteed to fail, sticking is

        in the less probable case switching fails and in the &gt;more probable
        case switching succeeds. We can be more formal as &gt;follows:) &gt;
        &gt;P(Win if switch) &gt;=P(Win if switch|first guess is

        asked me to apologize because he has done nothing to deserve my &gt;

        &gt; I will believe it. I wasn't asking you to believe anything, except
        that I accurately reported what I did. &gt; Actually getting 76 out of
        100 isn't so hard, after all you had 1/3 &gt; chance each time, that's
        not nothing. I haven't computed the odds for &gt; it But, I guess you
        missed that parts where I repeatedly said the I don't believe that
        chance rules human descision-making. &gt; but I guess it's not like it
        means you're so lucky you should win &gt; the lottery every week so that
        instead of wasting your time trying to &gt; convince us with words, you
        could just fly all of us to your place and &gt; we could try your
        program and get convinced easily. It would also be &gt; cool to see
        research that's not 70 years old. "Mind Reach" by Russell Targ &amp;
        Harold Puthoff, Introduction by Margaret Mead. ISBN 0-440-05688-8. &gt;
        I encourage you to win &gt; the lottery a few times and then sponsor
        some new research. You could &gt; also hire a few crackers to shoot down
        this website which sells ESP &gt; stuff: &gt; http://www.parascope.com
        &gt; &gt; They pretend to believe in this stuff but they say: &gt; &gt;
        "Rhine is often popularly remembered as the man who "proved" that &gt;
        psychic powers existed. While he did collect some compelling test &gt;
        results that indicated statistically unlikely accuracy among his &gt;
        subjects, subsequent examinations of his work have concluded that &gt;
        procedural flaws and probability loopholes invalidate any claims of &gt;
        proof." Don't believe everything you read. &gt; How can they dare to
        pretend they advocate ESP and the like if they &gt; attack completely
        honest and professional Mr Rhine? What a bad world &gt; this is... If
        you were being professional about this yourself, you could, of course,
        read Rhine yourself, and, rather than take his or anyone's word for it,
        you could run such tests yourself. That's what science is about, after
        all, not just mouthing off, cheering on those you believe. David J &gt;
        Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; P.S. Is somebody capable of computing the
        odds for winning those 76 &gt; out of 100? &gt;

        that they were being shown a magician's trick by Geller. They described

        confidence that Uri could do that trick [the blindfold drive] as well as
        any of the dozens of other magicians who do it. Targ and Puthoff issued
        a lengthy and quite positive scientific paper extolling the psychic
        abilities of Geller. Their protocols for this "serious" investigation of
        the powers claimed by Geller were described by Dr. Ray Hyman, who
        investigated the project on behalf of a U.S. funding agency, as "sloppy
        and inadequate." --- &gt; Don't believe everything you read. Don't

        Hi GameOfDeath, Stefan and I fully understand that running a simulation
        is not a mathematical proof. However, we have given a mathematical proof
        many times. In fact, Stefan has given the exact same mathematical proof,
        which is why we've resorted to simulations in an attempt to convince
        people that the answer is in deed 2/3 winning probability when one
        switches doors. You know... having 76 successes out of 100 is very
        nearly (order of magnitude) the probability of getting lucky on a
        Rubik's Cube is it not? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Can you honestly say that you didn't believe what you just quoted? IIRC
        Randi was there at SRI for the Iri Geller trials himself. He went over
        all of their procedures. He prides himself at being able to sniff out
        fakery. He found nothing wrong. He himself found that SRI's experiment
        was neither sloppy nor inadequate. I am not at all impressed that Randi
        quotes someone else describing that SRI experiment as sloppy and
        inadequate, especially when he knows better from his own experience.

        Yes, I'm not even reading the text but I am a firm non-believer of
        pseudo-science. Look David, we've outlined it very simply. We do not
        believe your code was written correctly. Please show us your code and if
        it does not contain errors, given that the probability of what you did
        was on the order of 10^-18, I will believe that you have ESP. If you
        show us your code, and it does indeed play the Monty Hall game, and you
        managed to get 76 wins without switching the door, I'll believe you have
        super-human powers. Either that, or just play my game. If you put in $4,
        and I put in $5, and out of 100 times you win 76 times, you win $468.
        That's a lot of money. With regards to ESP and all the arguments
        concerning time intervals and variations of the human mind, you are now
        simply deviating tremendously from your original statement that the
        probability of winning is 1/2 if one does not switch the door. Your
        unwillingness to take up Stefan or my offers in this manner shows us a
        lack of confidence you have in your answer. Or would you care to make a
        counter offer? Did you play Charles' program? With all of this said, I
        know this topic has strayed very far from Rubik's Cube, so I'm going to
        bring it back to the Rubik's Cube. If people are going to make claims,
        they should be willing to prove it. Creating a situation, such as this
        one, where things cannot be proven is not an excuse. In the case where
        something cannot be proven, we have no reason to believe it. No one can
        prove super-human powers, or ESP, or even religion for that matter, and
        so, the cubing community will not accept these reasons as excuses for
        whatever situation may arise. If you claim there are unicorns, it's your
        responsibility to prove to me that there's a unicorn. It's not my fault
        that I can't find a unicorn, and then you use that result to say that I
        can't disprove it, and therefore it's true. That's a logical fallacy.
        So, if you're going to post an unofficial world record, don't create a
        situation where you'll never be able to reproduce it, or you'll never be
        able to prove yourself. What if Macky started posting 11 second averages
        and then claimed, "I only have magical abilities on the cube when no one
        else is watching. Otherwise I get nervous. Oh, and if you film it, I get
        nervous too." Then how in the world are we supposed to verify it? If
        something cannot be proven, no one is going to give you the benefit of
        the doubt. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Dec

        analyzing screenshots for extra info is my hobby. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt;

        Oh, just for the fun of it, here's Uri Geller in the Tonight Show:
        http://homepage.mac.com/onegoodmove/movies/carsongeller.html I've seen
        him do this on German TV a year or so ago. If I remember correctly, it
        goes like this: Several boxes are on the table, all empty except one
        into which you've put some item. Geller puts his hand above them and
        then separates them in half, sliding half of them to the side a bit.
        Then he asks you to choose one of the groups which is then kept while
        the other is dismissed (or vice versa). Then he repeats until only one
        box remains. It is openend and hooray, the item is in it. As a
        non-magician (I tried to as a kid, but I suck as entertainer) my first
        idea would be to feel whether a box contains the item when I slide it.
        There might be more clever methods but I don't know any. Anyway, since I
        then know in which half it is, I choose what your choice means: keep or
        dismiss. The usual spectator is so busy with watching closely, that he
        doesn't notice it's not always the same rule. Geller supposedly "feels"
        where the item is simply by putting his hand *above* the boxes. So in
        the show, they of course didn't let him touch them. And guess what... he
        couldn't do it. And his very reasonable explanation is that he doesn't
        feel strong. Pity that the majority of the public still believes in this
        stuff. Cheers! Stefan

        I fully understand that running a simulation is not a &gt; mathematical

        fact, Stefan has given the exact same mathematical proof, &gt; which is
        why we've resorted to simulations in an attempt to convince &gt; people
        that the answer is in deed 2/3 winning probability when one &gt;
        switches doors. &gt; I guess I only read some of the posts. In that
        case, I take it back (about people using simulations instead of proofs)
        and instead congratulate you both for presenting proofs. &gt; You
        know... having 76 successes out of 100 is very nearly (order of &gt;
        magnitude) the probability of getting lucky on a Rubik's Cube is it &gt;
        not? I don't know what the probability of getting lucky on a Rubik's
        cube is. (Are you talking about the Revenge - with the probability being
        75% that one can skip one of the two non-standard 3x3x3 situations.) In
        fact, I don't even know the probablitiy of getting lucky. : ) I guess
        one must have P(Getting lucky on a Rubik's cube)= P(Getting lucky|one is
        on a Rubik's cube)= [P(Getting lucky)-P(Getting lucky|one is not on a
        Rubik's cube)*P(One is not being on a Rubik's cube)]/P(One is on a

        Hi :-) I'm no expert on megaminx, but it sounds to me like u got a bad
        specimen with some production error. Something like badly molded parts
        or an axis is not straight. But i'm really only guessing :-o Lubing and
        loosening the screws should have worked. Have u tried, btw, to see if
        there are molding imperfections that u can remove from any of the parts?
        If there is, use a sharp knife or sanding paper to remove it :-) Good

        Hello guys, I've always been a very crap algorithms performer. Even if
        my best average is 17.92, I still average over 7 seconds for the LL
        (sometimes over 8 or 9 !). I've timed all my PLL algorithms and took
        averages. The result is 3.28 seconds (for PLL only) (weighted average,
        knowing that the solved case time is 0 seconds). All my PLL were timed
        the same way : hands on the stackmat, sitting at a table. Here are the
        full results : http://www.belgiancubes.be/LL_average.pdf I'm first going
        to work on the over4 seconds cases, and the ones that add more than 0.2
        seconds to the average. This will take me to a 3.16 average for PLL, and
        then I'll take down all my over3.5 and over 0.17 weighted, and so on. My
        goal is 2.5 seconds. Afterwards, I'll do the same for OLL. I thought I
        would share this with you if any of you is in the same case as I am. I
        think that after this work I should be able to have a 16 seconds
        average. :D (then I'll work again on F2L also). Happy New Year ! Gilles.

        But I've been saying this a long time &gt; already so... oh well, maybe

        &gt; Stefan &gt; Thanks, I just went out and bought some softer springs
        so i'll see how those work out first, if not, i may buy some from you
        later on. Thanks for all the advice guys! Cheers, John

        Does this leave clock and square-1 as the only puzzles that are not
        averages of 5? It seems silly to not standardize everything if those are
        the only puzzles that will be mean of 3. Of course, I am ignoring
        blindfold because I don't think that should be an "average of" event. ~

        Hi Bob, Well, in defense of blindfold, you don't think it should be an
        "average of" event because right now the standards are very low. People
        aren't expected to complete every solve in blindfold with 100% accuracy,
        but I do believe that it will be possible in the near future. Leyan is
        pulling off 12 solves in a row with a 2:14 average, I'm sure the rest of
        us can do 5. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On
