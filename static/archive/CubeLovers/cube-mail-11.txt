I had to stare at my picture for a couple of minutes to be sure, but
yes it is.  How did you know?

>I would like to see the process generating the position!

This is doable, but it is a little harder said than done.  My "data base"
is just a simple flat file with the states and the level associated with
each state.  In the case of the 2x2x2, the file is about 625K, and
I have programs to search it readily.  If you use the file in
"Solver mode", my "Solver program" just generates all successors of the
current node, finds each successor in the data base (it is a simple binary
search, the file is sorted), chooses one at level N-1 (there is always
at least one), and makes that the new current node.  It stops when
N=0.

I have a "Solver program" for the "corners plus centers of the
3x3x3" as well, but again the data base is small.  It is actually
the original 625K file for the 2x2x2 case, plus three additional
625K files.  This simple file structure was chosen to keep the file
small.  There are no pointers, trees, or processes stored in the
data base.

The "edges of the 3x3x3 without centers" is a little tougher.  Early
in the project, I generated a data base for the first few levels
(six or seven, I think), and I have a "Solver program" that will
work up to that level.  However, the full "edges of the 3x3x3 without
centers" is a 4.2 gigabyte file on tape, so it is hard to process.
Also, the size of the equivalence classes is not in the data base,
only the level.  I have to calculate the size of each equivalence
class, and it is an expensive calculation.

I made a pass at the
file and calculated the number of equivalence classes (took
125 hours on a mainframe), but I only saved a summary.  I did not
save the number of equivalence classes for each state.  I found
the antipodal by looking for level 15, since I knew there was
only one occurrence, and since the level was in the data base.

I did save the summaries by tape, so I should only have to look
on two tapes to find the other two equivalence classes which
have 24 elements.

I disagree.  Look at the 1-2 edge.  If it's "flipped in place", then
since it appears to be fixed, the cube must flip around it.  But then
the four 3 faces would be where the 4 faces actually are.  No, it's
more complicated than just all-edges-flipped.

"[Q]uite extraordinary and wonderful" it is.

Unfortunately, this is wishfull thinking.
This antipode is 15 qtw from Home, an odd distance.
All edges flipped is an even distance from Home in the qtw metric.

Looking at Jerry Bryan's pictures, I see 5 two edge swaps.

If we assume face 1 is F, I get
          (FU) (BD) (FD,BU) (FL,LU) (FR, RU) (LD,BL) (RD,BR)


Is the 1152 number the result of factoring out the 24 spatial rotations
and 2 reflections of the centers?

Are there any estimates of how many distinct sequences actually generate
this Antipodal Class?
Ideally, it would be interesting to have a total list of these sequences.

Greetings.

   I have been away from cubing since the early 80's, which was
before I went to school and before I did much computer work. 
After reading the recent archives I rushed out to find a square1
and fell in love all over again, only this time, I'm armed.  I
was somewhat amazed to find, however, that not a single other
cube puzzle was available at ToysRUs or at any of the stores I
tried first. I went back and reread Hofstadter's articles after
Jerry Bryan's recommendation and came across the address for Uwe
M'effert Novelties, Princewell (Far East), Ltd., P.O. Box 31008,
Causeway Bay, Hong Kong.  Does anyone know if this company still
exists?  Additionally, does anyone know of any mail order company
where cubes and cube-variants can be purchased?  Thanks.

      ...  It is really quite extraordinary and wonderful.  I already knew
      that there were only four equivalence classes with 24 elements.  Well,
      two of them are Start itself and its antipodal.  Without further ado:...

   This is very interesting indeed!  
   So the next natural question would seem to be: What are the -other- two?

Switch each edge with its antipode, with or without flipping all twelve edges.

    Instead of toy stores, I'd try game stores.  I don't know if you'll
be able to find a Square-1 or not.  It has been a couple of years since
they come out.

    I believe that this company has not been around for several years.
I did buy a couple of their "cubes" about ten years ago.  But at some
point they seemed to have disapeared.  Too bad they had some unique
variations.

>Additionally, does anyone know of any mail order company

    Yes.  It seems that just recently Ishi Press has made some of the
cube-variants available.  I saw a 5x5x5 cube in a game store recently
from Ishi Press.  Game stores are a good place to look since Ishi has
long been providing products for the games; Go and Shogi.  Note that
there is even an email address!

It is in fact the position arrived at by flipping all edges in place, *then*
reflecting the entire configuration. I believe this also tells us what the
other two equivalence classes with just 24 elements are: they are the
results of doing each of these two operations separately.

   Unfortunately, this is wishfull thinking.
   This antipode is 15 qtw from Home, an odd distance.
   All edges flipped is an even distance from Home in the qtw metric.

   Looking at Jerry Bryan's pictures, I see 5 two edge swaps.

The antipodal position is an interesting one. If you take the antipodal
position, and flip all the edges, you get:

        *5*                      
        5*5                      
        *5*                      
        *1*                      
        1*1                      
        *1*                      
     *3**2**4*                   
     3*32*24*4                   
     *3**2**4*                   
        *6*                      
        6*6                      
        *6*                      

Antipodal with edges flipped.

This looks like a rotation of the solved state at first glance, since
all the faces on a given side of the cube are the same color. But
look again! This is not the solved state of the original cube, but 
of the mirror image cube. If you added in the centers or the corners,
there would be no way to add them to make this a solved state.

Indeed.  I spoke too quickly when I said the antipodal was simply
Start with the edges flipped.  I stared at it, flipped the edges in
my mind, and it "looked" solved, so I assumed it was Start.

I am not yet for sure what they look like, but of the other two states
with order-24 equivalence classes, one is at level 9 and the other
is at level 12.  Since the only one at an even level is at level 12,
I am assuming that will be the one which is Start with the edges all
flipped.  The one at level 9 will probably be the mirror image of Start.

It's interesting to note that this is All-Edges-Flipped composed with
a mirror reflection of Start.  Begging the question: *which* mirror
reflection?  The answer is, it doesn't matter: since these are the
edges of a cube without centers, all reflections are the same
position.  As long as we get to choose which reflection, the canonical
one would be the central reflection.  When composed with All-Edges-
Flipped, it makes the following antipode.  (I think using BFTDLR
notation instead of 123456 makes these diagrams a lot easier to read).

If an order-24 equivalence class means what I think it does, I'm
pretty sure those two states have to be Mirror-Start and All-Edges-
Flipped, being the only sufficiently symmetric positions.  But as to
their depth, the parity argument (which Chris Worrell also cited) is
not valid here.  Remember that the cube has no face centers, so the
position is not changed by rotating the assemblage of edges in space
(i.e., with respect to the absent face centers).  But a quarter-turn
of the cube in space is an odd permutation of the edges.  So permuta-
tion parity is not an intrinsic property of edge positions.  We can
show that there is no sort of parity here by explicitly constructing
an odd cycle.  Just use a process that would permute the edges of a
cube with faces as (FR,FT,FL,FD)(BR,BT,BL,BD)(RT,TL,LD,DR).  This has
to be an odd process, but it's an identity on the faceless cube.

My (very cheap) guess for where we will find the other two M-symmetric
positions is opposite to Jerry Bryan's.  On a cube with faces, the
central reflection of the edges with respect to the faces is Pons
Asinorum, which has the easy 12-qt tight lower bound we've seen before
(or if not, you can of course get it from me with email).  I'm
guessing that this bound happens to be tight on the cube without
faces, as well.  But I have no proof of this guess, and I'm very
grateful we won't have to settle for guesses for very long.

Dan Hoey is correct.  Mirror-Image-of-Start is at level 12.
Edges-Flipped is at level 9.  Mirror-Image-of-Start-and-Edges-Flipped
is at level 15.  And, of course, Start is at Level 0.  This exhausts
the list of configurations with order-24 symmetry.

I am still thinking about the easiest way to extract sequences of
operators from my data base.  I gather from Dan's comments that a
12-qt operator is known for Mirror-Image-of-Start.  Are operators
known for the other two cases?  This is going to be sufficiently
time-consuming that I don't want to try to find operators that
are already known.

>>It's got to be all edges flipped in place.

Oops. Well I figured if all edges flipped was one of the hardest
know cube states that in the case of edges-only it would be the
antipode. I'm now sure (I think) that it is really:

       all edges flipped + 4 X
(with the 4 X on sides F, R, B, L which should match Dan's diagram)

Hmmmm, I don't know if this is a standard form of representation,
but this picture looks like a folded out cube:

               + T +                        + F +
               T   T                        R   L
               + T +                        + B +

        + L +  + F +  + R +          + D +  + D +  + D +

        + L +  + F +  + R +          + T +  + T +  + T +

               + B +                        + T +
               B   B           --------->   R   L
               + B +           |            + D +
                               |

                             + D +
In my program I would have   L   R  on the screen for the bottom face.
                             + T +

The idea is you are always looking at a cube face head-on (just to
clarify the difference in diagrams).

I'd still like to see the process for all-edges-flipped (not
caring about the centres or corners). So "level" is the number of moves
required to solve the position? That means edges flipped in place
can be done in 12 qtw.

Subject:   1152-fold Symmetry and 24-fold Symmetry

I guess it's time to try to explain what I mean by 1152-fold symmetry
and 24-fold symmetry.

Let me start with two or three very simple ideas.  First, consider
two equally colored and oriented cubes at Start.  To one of them,
apply F, and to the other one apply R.  The obvious solution to the
first one is then F' and the obvious solution to the second on is
then R'.  But take both cubes and toss them through the
air to someone else, so that the spatial orientation is lost.
Almost anyone would solve either cube by finding the one face that
was twisted clockwise and simply twisting it counter-clockwise.
No distinction between F and R would be made, and it would be
"obvious" to any reasonable person that the cubes were equivalent.

As a slightly more formal application of this idea, consider again
Start to which R has been applied.  We could rotate the whole
cube in space using Singmaster's script-U operation.  That is, grasp
the Up (top) of the cube and turn the whole cube in space clockwise.
Now, the cube looks like F has been applied rather than R, and the
solution looks like F' rather than R'.  If we applied F', the cube
would be solved, but the colors would be oriented wrong.  We could
restore the colors by script-U'.  Thus, (script-U F' script U') is
exactly the same thing as R' (we are just using conjugates in a
very simple way).

Continuing in this vein, take any two equally colored and oriented
cubes at Start.  To one of them, apply some long sequence of
permutations P.  To the second one, apply (script-U P script-U').
At this point, the two cubes are definitely not "equal" in some
sense  -- you could clearly tell them apart.  Yet, they are
clearly "equivalent" in some sense, because if P' is a solution to
the first cube, then (script-U P' script-U') is a solution to the
second one.  Furthermore, it should be obvious that it is not really
necessary to use the (script-U script-U') conjugate on the second
cube.  Rather we can think of some rotation as having been performed
on P to give Q, and then of Q as having been performed on Start, so
that the same rotation that was applied to P could be applied to P'
to give Q', and Q' is equivalent to (script-U P' script-U').

If I can wax sophomorically philosophical for a minute, I tend to
think of there being two kinds of permutations in mathematics.
The first is the "permutations and combinations" kind of thing you
run into in probability and statistics.  The second is the permutation
operator kind of thing you run into in abstract algebra or group
theory.  With this kind of thinking, the cube itself represents the
first kind of permutation, where the cube is an object being operated
on, and the twists of the cube are the second kind of permutation,
where the twists are permutation operators and are doing the operating.
Well, at some deep level, the two kinds of permutations are very much
the same thing, so it is very natural to think of operating on
(rotating, in this particular case) a permutation P, where P itself
is an operator.

I need one more simple idea.  Again, think of a cube in Start, and
think of Singmaster's script-U operator.  We can (informally) write
script-U = (Front --> Left --> Back --> Right --> Front).  But suppose
the cube is colored as Font=Red, Left=White, Back=Orange, Right=Blue).
We could just as well write script-U = (Red --> White --> Orange
--> Blue --> Red).  It looks as if for any fixed coloring, we can
freely interchange Singmaster's notation with a notation based on
colors.  But we can't really.  For example, colored as I described it
above, script-F is equivalent to script-Red.  Either is the same as
grasping the front of the cube and rotating the whole cube clockwise.
But first perform script-U.  Now, script-F is the same as
script-Blue).  The Front/Back/Up/Down/Left/Right notation is fixed in
space, but the color notation is not.

Now, we try to put all this together.  Once again, consider two
equally colored and equally oriented cubes in space, and apply F
to the first one and (R script-U) to the second one.  Both
cubes can now be described as "Start with the front twisted clockwise
by 90 degrees), but the colors are not the same.  They are clearly
equivalent, but under my internal computer model for the cube, they
are not equal.  Furthermore, no amount of additional application of
Singmaster's whole cube "script" operators will make them equal.
The only thing that will make them equal will be to rotate the colors.

The exact same thing applies to reflections.  Consider two equally
colored and oriented cubes in Start, and apply F to one and F' to
the other.  The cubes are equivalent but not equal.  Hold up the
cube to which F' has been applied to a mirror.  The mirror-image
now has F applied instead of F', but the colors are wrong (they
have been reflected).  To make the cubes equal, it is necessary to
reflect the colors of the mirror-image.

Hence, my program generates equivalence classes by applying
a cube rotation, a color rotation, a cube reflection, and a color
reflection.  There are 24 cube rotations and 24 color rotations
(one of each is the identity), and any cube rotation can occur with
any color rotation.  There are 2 cube reflections and 2 color
reflections (one each is the identity), but the cube reflection
identity must occur with the color reflection identity and vice
versa.  Thus, there are (in general) 24x24x2 elements in each
equivalence class.  I only store one element of each equivalence
class in my data base.  Some of the equivalence classes have fewer
than 24x24x2 elements, namely those for which the cube configuration
inherently has a high degree of symmetry.

* sign *  No, I see I entered the position into my program wrong.
A central reflection of the edges with respect to the faces is
simply 6 X or checkerboard order 2, solvable in 12 qtw or 6 htw.
So the edges-only antipode is:  all-edges-flipped + 6 X.

Jerry Byran quote:

Ok, only 9 qtw.... it's got to play havoc with corners. I got it now.

* Hmmm, what are all the possible orders of symmetry? *

Also I note my "Symmetry Level" is the opposite of Jerry's Order-N
symmetry:

Of course all-edges-flipped I never included, as at the time I was
looking at the square's group.

-------------------------------

As a small postfix to my cyclic decomposition article, I found the
following patterns. I'm fond of pattern 16 myself. I am looking for
CD-type processes for 6 X order 3 and 6 X order 6. I find when I
am physical cubing (as opposed to computer cubing or old fashioned
mental cubing!) it really helps having a CD-type process memory-wise.
Memorizing the computer generated processes is like memorizing
prime numbers.

p161 Mark's Pattern 16  (F1 R1 L1 B1) ^3 + F2 B2 D2 F2 B2 T2    (18)
p162 2 X, 4 H full      (F1 T2 B1) ^4                           (12)

p166 2 H adj swap       (F1 L2 T2 R2 B1) ^2 + L2 T2 R2 D2 L2 T2 (16)

No doubt these are compressible and hence not as efficient, but if
you consider ease of execution....

Subject:   That's all the 48-Fold Symmetries

The two patterns I just posted are the only two for which the size
of the equivalence class is 48.  The next size up is 72, and there
are twelve patterns whose equivalence class size is 72.  Things
become less interesting as the equivalence class size increases because
they are less symmetrical overall.  Also, there are more patterns.
Finally, these things take a good deal of time to chase down.
Therefore, I am going to stop chasing down "pretty patterns"
for now unless somebody is just dying to see the patterns whose
equivalence class size is 72.

Finally, nobody really answered an earlier question, but is the
following true:  1) Mirror-Image-of-Start is 12 q-turns from
Start, and a sequence is known (Dan Hoey sent me a well-known
sequence), 2) All-Edges-Flipped is 9 q-turns from Start, and a
sequence is known, and 3) Mirror-Image-of-Start-and-All-Edges-Flipped
(the antipodal of Start) is 15 q-turns from Start, and a sequence
is *not* known?  If this is true, then I will start working on
the 15 move sequence.

There are no *the* basic combinations.  I would guess there are as many
different sets of combinations as there are cube solvers.

Well, for what it's worth, when I solve a cube, I do it as follows.

(Slice turns: if I write FB, I mean turn the F-B slice in the direction
one would turn F for an F turn, similarly for other slice turns: turn
the slice as if it were carried along by the turn named by the first
letter.  Thus LR and RL are inverses.  Is there some standard
representation for slice turns?)

- Solve one layer ad-hoc.  (This refers to a layer of cubies, not just
  one face of the cube.)  I often don't worry about edge flips at this
  stage.  Some simple operators I use:
	To get corners in place: F D' F, or F' D F, depending on corner
		orientation.
	To get edges in place: If the cubie is on the D face,
		FB/BF/RL/LR, D/D', inverse of the slice turn.  If it's
		on the middle layer, F/B/R/L, UD/DU, inverse of face
		turn.

- Turn the cube so the solved face is L.  Solve what then becomes the
  R-L slice layer with a combination of R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2, to move
  cubies around within the slice layer, and either of two sequences to
  move cubies between the R layer and the slice layer:
	R2 D R' B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R' D'
	FB D R' B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R' D' BF
  (The first one is a sequence that normally ends with R2, but since
  the R layer is scratch at this point I often don't bother.)  These
  are, of course, interspersed with R, R2, and R' turns to get edges in
  the correct places for them.

At this point you will have two layers solved, except possibly for some
flipped edges.

Next, corners of the "scratch" layer.  Check them for placement,
ignoring orientation.  They can be:
	1) All in place.  This is the easy case. :-)
	2) Two swapped.  Make one quarter-turn to reach case 3.  (They
	   can't be diagonal, they must be adjacent - or some joker has
	   taken your cube apart.)
	3) One in place, other three permuted.
	4) Two pairs, each swapped.  If the swaps are diagonal, turn the
	   layer a half-turn to reach case 1.
In case 3 or 4, the corners can be put in place by holding the cube
with the unsolved layer as U and repeating
L F L' F' L F L' F' L F L' F' twice, turning U so as to place
appropriate pairs of cubies in the UFL and UBL corners.

To orient the corners correctly, hold the cube with the unsolved layer
as F and use R B2 R' U' B2 U and its inverse U' B2 U R B2 R' with a
turn of the F face in between; this will allow you to twist the corners
into correct orientation.

All that remains at this point is positioning the edges on the last
layer, and possibly some edge flips.  To position the edges, I normally
use (with U as the unsolved layer)
	R2 D R' B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R' D' R2
	FB D R' B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R' D' BF
	R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2
with appropriate turns of U in between, swapping the FR and BR edges
repeatedly as auxiliaries while swapping pairs of edges on U to get
them in place.  (The difference between the first two sequences is that
the first one swaps UB and UR, the second UB and RU.)

Edge flips are all that's left at this point.  Judicious choice of
which of the two sequences above can often drastically reduce the work
to be done here, but there's often some left anyway.  The basic
sequence I use for this is RL U RL U RL U RL U, which flips four edge
cubies in-place: UB, UL, DB, and DF.  (A similar sequence U RL U RL U
RL U RL is similar but flips UR instead of UL; this can be thought of
as U X U', where X is the first-given sequence.)  My use of this
sequence is usually ad-hoc; sequences such as X F X F' will let you
flip arbitrary pairs of edges.

Presto!  You have a solved cube. :-)  In practice, I often take
shortcuts; for example, if X represents the R B2 R' U' B2 U sequence,
then X B2 X B2 X B2 will twist three corners on B....

Subject: Symmetry

I suppose it's time for a few observations on symmetry.  After all,
tomorrow is the thirteenth anniversary of "Symmetry and Local Maxima."

As Jerry Bryan notes, we can perform the "R" turn by rotating the cube
to put the R face in front, performing "F", and undoing the rotation.
But we can also perform "R'" by reflecting the cube in a left-to-right
mirror, performing "L", and undoing the reflection.  Thus conjugation
can be extended to use the 48-element group of rotations and
reflections, which we call M.

In the absence of face centers, there is another kind of reduction
that takes account of the 24 possible positions of the resulting
collection of edges in space.  So two positions X and Y are considered
equivalent if
    X = m' Y m c
where m is a rotation or reflection in M, and c is a rotation.

My understanding of Jerry Bryan's method is that he combines "m c"
into a single rotation or reflection, and factors out the reflection
on both sides.  It seems to me that what he calls a a "color rotation"
is premultiplication, while a "cube rotation" is postmultiplication.
[I am somewhat uncertain of this, because it doesn't explain how there
can be a 1252-element symmetry group when face centers are present, so
perhaps I'm missing something crucial.]

But I think we are at least conceptually better off dealing with M
when dealing with conjugation, because it takes account of the
essential similarity between clockwise and anticlockwise turns.  Alan
Bawden mentioned back in 1980 that certain positions with sufficient
symmetry were local maxima (in terms of distance from start), on the
grounds that any clockwise or anticlockwise turn gives us essentially
the same position.  Jim Saxe and I formalized the notion in a paper
entitled "Symmetry and Local Maxima" that we posted on 14 December
1980.  [You can find it in /pub/cube-lovers/cube-mail-1.Z on
FTP.AI.MIT.Edu].

We had some hope that some of these local maxima might turn out to be
global maxima.  My hopes for that have been somewhat low in recent
years.  That is perhaps my best excuse for not noticing immediately
that the single global maximum for the edge group turns out to be one
of these symmetric local maxima.  In fact, all four of the positions
with 24-element equivalence classes appear in the list of M-symmetric
positions.

The paper on Symmetry and Local Maxima also catalogues the positions
that have 48-element equivalence classes and 72-element equivalence
classes.  The The former are the H-symmetric positions, "Six-H" and
"Six-H with all edges flipped".  The latter are the twelve T-symmetric
positions.  For T-symmetry, the set of flipped edges may be any of
{none, girdle-edges, off-girdle-edges, or all}; the set of edges
exchanged with their antipodes may be any of the four as well.  But if
we choose "none" or "all" for all both choices we get one of the four
M-symmetric positions with 24-element equivalence classes, so only
twelve of the sixteen possibilities have 72-element equivalence
classes.

With regard to the edge cube, I should mention that no one has
mentioned a 9 QT process for the all-flip nor a 15 QT process for the
pons-asinorum-all-flip.  Of course, the latter would be somewhat more
interesting, being the longest optimal sequence.

I managed to pick up all four Tangle puzzles in an obscure shop in
Jakarta, Indonesia. The puzzles are similar, except that the extra(25th)
piece is different in each. The solutions for each puzzle are very
different and I could not see any pattern. I solved all 4 using
'intelligent brute force', i.e. made the search as efficient as I could.
But the 10*10 puzzle seems intractable. The 5*5 could be solved using a
486DX2-66 PC in about 20 minutes. The 10*10 will take several months using
my algorithm. 
Does anyone have a more intelligent, or a more brute method? Once this
puzzle has been put in the public domain, we MUST find a solution. So, any
ideas are welcome!
Thanks

Could you explain what your algorithm was?

I have one of the puzzles, number 4, I believe, and spent a large amount
of time trying to find a solution that was not trial and error.  I could
not.

The algorithm that I used to have the computer solve it for me was to
fill the 5x5 in the following manner, recursively, returning when no
possible pieces fit.

 1  2  4  7 11
   /  /  /  /
  /  /  /  /
 3  5  8 12 16
   /  /  /  /
  /  /  /  /
 6  9 13 17 20
   /  /  /  /
  /  /  /  /
10 14 18 21 23
   /  /  /  /
  /  /  /  /
15 19 22 24 25

(wrapping at the edges to keep incrementing properly)

I did that because given any pieces diagonal from one another, there are
at most two pieces that can fill the gap (line up with both correctly).
(When the four colors are different, there are two tiles
 When there is a single repeated color, there is one tile
 When there are 2 pairs of colors there is no tile
 And in all these cases, if the tile(s) was already used, or didn't
exist, that is the bottom of that branch of the search tree)

Is this better or worse than the algorithm you used?

Has anyone found a non-brute-force solution scheme?

>perhaps I'm missing something crucial.]

I just reread "Symmetry and Local Maxima".  Let's see if I can make
some sense of this.  I believe "pre-multiplication" and
"post-multiplication" are correct.  In my computer model, the
corner facelets are simply numbered from 1 to 24, and any configuration
of the corners is an order-24 row vector.  The rotation and reflection
operators are also order-24 row vectors, again with each cell simply
containing a number from 1 to 24.

In almost anybody's programming language you would copy an order-24
row vector with something like

     For i = 1 to 24  B(i) = A(i)

Well, if P is a rotation operator, you could perform a rotation
two ways.  I guess one is pre-multiplication and one is
post-multiplication.

    1)  For i = 1 to 24  B(i) = A(P(i))
    2)  For i = 1 to 24  B(i) = P(A(i))

(As an aside, this illustrates the question I raised in my previous
post about "which is the operator and which is the thing being
operated on?"  Is P operating on A, or is A operating on P?)

In fact, if what I am doing is properly called pre- and post-
multiplication, then I am doing both as a part of a single,
composite operator.  I.e.,

       For i = 1 to 24  B(i) = P(A(P(i)))

More completely, there are 24 rotations, P1 through P24, so the
actual loop looks something like

       For j = 1 to 24 for k = 1 to 24
             for i = 1 to 24 Bj,k(i) = Pj(A(Pk(i)))

Finally, if Q is a reflection (actually, if Q1 is the identity and
Q2 is the reflection), then we have

      For j = 1 to 24 for k = 1 to 24 for m = 1 to 2
             for i = 1 to 24 Bj,k,m(i) = Qm(Pj(A(Qm(Pk(i)))))

I believe this loop calculates Dan Hoey's M.  In my data base, I
store the minimum of Bj,k,m over j = 1 to 24, k = 1 to 24, and
m = 1 to 2.  I tend to call the minimum of Bj,k,m a canonical
form.  I am not sure if that is the best terminology.  The
minimal element is not any simpler than any other.  It is just
that I need a function to choose an element from a set, and
picking the minimal element seems very natural.  Any other
element would do as well, provided I could always be sure of
picking the same element.

Also, my criterion for equivalence is slightly
different (but isomorphic, I think) than the one described by
Dan Hoey.  Suppose A and B are two cubes.
Rather than mapping A to B or B to A in M, I map both A and B
to their respective canonical forms.  A and B are equivalent if
their respective canonical forms are equal.

I hasten to add that the actual loop in the program is a bit
more complex than the one shown above.  The one above would
be far too slow. The actual loop is several hundred times
faster.

Now, as to the centers.  I still sometimes have a certain doubt
about the centers.  They are fixed, so how can you reduce the
problem (i.e., increase the size of the equivalence classes)
by both rotating the cube and rotating the colors (by both pre-
and post-multiplication)?

In my computer model for the centers, I simply number center facelets
from 1 to 6, and the centers are stored as an order-6 row vector.
The centers are disjoint from the corners (as well as from the edges),
so there is no problem in numbering one set of objects from 1 to 24 and
another from 1 to 6.

I define a set of 24 rotation operators P* on the centers, corresponding
to the 24 rotation operators P on the corners, and a set of 2 reflection
operators Q* on the centers, corresponding to the 2 reflection operators
Q on the corners.  Then, if C is an order-6 row vector representing
the centers, I calculate Dj,k,m = Q*m(P*j(C(Q*m(P*k)))) anytime
I calculate Bj,k,m = Qm(Pj(A(Qm(Pk)))).

   (Read the asterisks above as superscripts.  I am not intending
    the multiplication operation which the asterisk denotes in
    many programming languages.)

Hence, I rotate and reflect the centers right along with the corners.
But there are only 24 distinct states for the centers, and each can
occur with any canonical form for the corners.  Hence, the "corners
plus centers" data base is exactly 24 times larger than
the "2x2x2" data base.

My model for the cube seems to start out 24 times larger than
everybody else's.  However, by storing only the canonical form
for each equivalence class, and since most of the equivalence
classes have 1152 elements, my data base seems to end up about
48 times smaller than everybody else's.  This fact seems to
remain true, even when the "fixed centers" are added in.

I am not sure if this answers Dan's question about my model
with centers added.  Effectively, I am using a "fixed corners"
representation of the cube, and rotating the centers.  Each
equivalence class for the corners under M has (up to) 1152
elements, and each equivalence class for the centers under
M has only 24 elements.  But it doesn't seem to matter.
(Up to) 48 different configurations of the corners within
M share each configuration of the centers.

Since I am in this deep, let me finish explaining certain details
of my model.  I don't really store all 24 elements of each
row vector.  I really just store 8.  That is, I store the
facelets for the front and back face.  The other 16 facelets
can be reconstructed from the first 8.  In effect, storing
a number from 1 to 24 stores both the location of each cubie
and its twist.  Finally, I really, really only store 7 elements.
In the canonical form, the first element is always 1, so there
is no reason to store it.  Thus, a data base record for the
2x2x2 looks like

    CCCCCCC,L

where the CCCCCCC are the seven elements representing the canonical
form, and L is the corresponding level.

When you add the centers, I started out with notion that the
order-6 row vector for center only has 24 possible states.  Thus,
it can be encoded as a number from 1 to 24.  This lead to the
following

    CCCCCCC,L,R

where CCCCCCC and L are as before, and R is an index encoding
the orientation of the centers.  But this can be improved upon
even further.  With my model for the corners plus centers, each
distinct value of CCCCCCC will occur exactly 24 times, and each
distinct value of CCCCCCC is already represented in my data
base for the 2x2x2.  Hence, I can have the exact same number of
(longer) records, and encode the corners of the 3x3x3 as

    CCCCCCC,L,L1 L2 L3 .... L23 L24

where CCCCCCC is as before, L is the level of CCCCCCC in the
2x2x2, and L1 through L24 are the levels of CCCCCCC in the corners
of the 3x3x3 when the index of the position of the centers with
respect to the corners is 1 through 24, respectively.  Hence, my
data base for the corners of the 3x3x3 has the same number of
records as the data base for the 2x2x2, and is physically only
four times larger.

I will work on these two cases, but it will take some time.  My model
is very good at storing a great many states of the cube very
compactly, but it does not encode processes at all.  I will have
to extract the processes by hand.  This is quite easy in my
data bases for the 2x2x2 and corners of 3x3x3.  But it is quite
hard for the edges because the data base is 4.2 gigabytes.

Look again.  The puzzles are identical except for a remapping of the colors.
For example, if you take Tangle #1 and paint all the Blue ropes Yellow, all
the Red ropes Blue, all the Green ropes Red, and all the (originally) Yellow
ropes Green, you'll have Tangle #2.  So you can solve Tangle #1 by imagining
the ropes recolored as above, constructing your solution for #2, and then
restoring the original colors.

Note: The particular recoloring given above is based on colors given in a
message sent by CCW@eql.caltech.edu (Chris Worrell) to cube-lovers on April
27, 1992.  I own only #1 myself and so cannot confirm or deny the accuracy
of the colors.  But the basic idea applies, given that each puzzle (a) has
the same pattern of ropes on all pieces and (b) has each permutation of
colors exactly once except for one permutation which appears twice.

Solving the 10x10 is another kettle of fish, and I haven't tried it.  I do
have a program that solves the 5x5 in about 45 seconds on a SparcStation II,
but I haven't looked into how much longer it would take on the 10x10.

My solution was brute-force.  I posted to cube-lovers (again, in April '92)
asking if anyone had found a more logical approach to the puzzle, but got no
affirmative responses.

Dale's method is a little inefficient in the order in which it tries tiles.
Mine used the sequence:			Dale's used:

	 1   3   5   7   9		 1   2   4   7  11

	 2   4   6   8  10		 3   5   8  12  16
	
	11  12  13  14  15		 6   9  13  17  20
	
	16  17  18  19  20		10  14  18  21  23
	
	21  22  23  24  25		15  19  22  24  25

The first three tiles in our two methods are equally constrained, but the
next seven in Dale's methods are constrained along 1-2-1-1-2-2-1 edges,
while mine are constrained along 2-1-2-1-2-1-2 edges.  So I suspect my
search tree gets trimmed a bit more quickly.  Another way in which the
search can be made more efficient is in finding the pieces to try in each
position.  For each pair of colors that can appear along an edge, my program
precomputes a table listing all tiles that can match that pair of colors,
including how to rotate the tiles.

A few messages back I mentioned a cyclicly decomposable process for
the pattern 6 X order 3. Success! Those familar with Christoph
Bandelow's "Inside Rubik's Cube and Beyond" will recognize the
notation, but for those who don't:

Mr is the middle slice adjacent to face R
Mu is the middle slice adjacent to face U (or T)
Mf is the middle slice adjacent to face F

Thus Mr1 rotates the middle slice in the same direction as r1,
etc. ...fairly intuitive.

The 28 slice moves are rather lengthy, but one can follow the
progression to 6 X order 3 easily. Before the discovery of
process p1b, memorization and execution of this pattern was
difficult. By memorization I don't mean retention for days or
weeks or even months as I wanted a CD-type process with which I
could always reconstruct it in my head.

Perhaps this could be improved upon, nevertheless now
the checkerboard order 3 is easy to execute and easy to remember!

(rotates edges 120 degrees around the FTR corner and BDL corner)
p1b  alternate method 2 (Mr2 D3 Mr2 U1) ^3  TOP becomes LEFT     (28s)
                        (Mr2 D3 Mr2 U1) ^3  LEFT becomes TOP

Hmmmm, a little inconsistent (sp?) with the notation there.
I usually only use U when quoting the processes of others.

I'm going to try tackling the 1152-fold symmetry idea
later tonight.

When looking for CD-type processes I find it helps to think
in terms of distinct states you pass through in approaching
the goal state. Sort of like factoring a composite pattern
into simpler ones you add together.

Rotating the cube in space definitely helps too.

I had kind of hoped that the connectivity on the different puzzles was
different, instead of just the colors.

(Actually, the sequence I sent before was slightly wrong--here is the
one I actually used. Using Don's format)

But yes, Don's fillpattern still gets more constraints in earlier--here
is the number of constraints at each step
Don's: 0 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2
Mine:  0 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
As you can see, I had my 1's clustered more toward the beginning, which
is non-optimal.

Assuming that there is only a change in color(and not in connectivity),
as was posted by Chris in april of 92, I would think modifying code to
attempt the 10x10 would be fairly simple...(seeing as my code went poof
sometime last year, when a disk crashed(not that it was
complicated))...wanna try?

(Thanks for the pointers to the Apr 92 discussion)
I agree with the concensus expressed in the archives that this puzzle is
inherently "not that great" because no non-brute-force method has been
found/seems to exist.

My method is essentially the same as yours - I have several intermediate
tables which cut down the processing required within the innermost loop. I
tried the same for 10*10 but it was taking eons. I tried making tables of
2*2 arrangements and solving for 5*5 of these(thereby solving the original
10*10, but the number of 2*2 arrangements makes the problem intractable on
my measly little computer. I even trie putting together all possible 5*5
solutions and assembling them in the 10*10 pattern, but the number of 5*5
solutions with the 100 tiles is in millions!
Do you have any further insight?

Just because no non-brute-force method has been found, does not make this
puzzle any less intersting. As we have been told that there is a
solution, it is exciting to search for one, even by brute force methods.
The real challenge is to find a brute-force method with sufficient insight
to solve the problem within a reasonable time-frame. All the algorithms so
far are exponential. We may never find a linear algorithm for this
problem. The idea is to find one algorithm that can be used in actual
practice. We can then bury this puzzle into the archives, for the next
generation to pick up!

Is this the reason why Rubik has gone into hiding? I haven't seen any
puzzle from him after this set of 4 released in 1990/1991. I tried to
contact the Hong Kong office of Matchbox which gets Rubik's puzzles in
China, but they have closed shop. Matchbox UK said that they have
discontinued this line. If anyone has found another source for Rubik's
puzzles, or discovered anyone else who has taken the responsibility of
giving us sleepless nights, please let me know!

Hm, didn't "Square-1" come out later than the Tangles?

Regarding solving the Tangle, I forgot one other minor optimisation: When
my program is picking a corner piece other than the first, it requires that
the piece "number" be less than or equal to that of the first corner.  I.e.,
it refuses to search for solutions that are rotations of other solutions.

I've modified my program to try the 10x10, but indeed, it's taking a long
time.  (Current estimate is it will take over a year to finish.)  I suspect
that fact that pieces aren't "used up" as fast -- i.e., since there's at
least four of any given piece, there will usually be at least one of whatever
you're looking for for quite a ways down the search tree -- makes this
approach intractible.

My memory may be extremely faulty of course, but was there not more than
one single solution for the 5x5?  (Not unprecedented, I have one puzzle
that promises a single solution but there are hundreds.)  And, is there

Square-1 is not by Rubik.  But he came this year with two new puzzles (at
least, they are in his name).  Rubik's Maze and Rubik's Hat.

In the first there are 6 connected cubes with a black/yellow pattern on
them.  The cubes can turn around each other fairly freely.  The purpose
is to get a 1x2x3 where there is a single black continuous line along
the cubes.  Not very difficult, interesting.

Rubik's Hat is in the form of a hat with six rings on it.  You can look
trough it (and through the rings by implication).  By turning rings you
see more or less rabbits.  The purpose is to see a rabbit in every position.
I think the puzzle is based on light polarization, with different
polarizations coming through the segments of the rings.

 For each Tangle, there are 2 solutions and no more. I have searched the
tree thoroughly and verified this. Counting 4 rotations and that 2 pieces
are identical, the total search gives 16 'solutions'.
The colourful little pamphlet that comes with the puzzle says that there
IS a solution to the 10*10 puzzle.

 True. The 5*5 puzzle search truncates much faster because you run out of
pieces that could fit into a specific slot. The same does not apply to the
10*10 one.
Has anyone tried to solve the 10*10 for just 1 colour. That leaves you
with only 4 tile types with 24,25 or 26 of each type. The solution may
give some indication of the resultant pattern of the selected colour. If
there aren't too many solutions, maybe we can build the 4 colour solution
from this my permuting and rotating thr tiles. Any idea on how this will work?

   Hm, didn't "Square-1" come out later than the Tangles?

Did Rubik have anything to do with Square-1?

In any case, it's a great puzzle, and I recommend it to anyone on the
list who hasn't tried it. While there's a group structure lurking here
as usual, this is the only puzzle I've seen where the set of
attainable positions is not a subgroup. This means lots of the usual
ways of thinking about puzzles like this (e.g. conjugation) don't
always work, which makes it quite challenging.

Subject:   Duality of Operators and Operatees

I have mentioned several times my discomfort about "an operator"
as opposed to "the thing being operated on" when it comes to
groups.  I am never quite sure just which of the two it is
that people are talking about, even (or especially) when I am listening
to myself talk.  There is clearly an essential duality between the
two, but I am not sure I have quite a strong enough group theory
background to fully understand it.  I am very comfortable when the
operators form a group, but I am not very comfortable when the things
being operated on form a group.

I am presently rereading (hopefully VERY SLOWLY
AND VERY CAREFULLY) Dan Hoey and Jim Saxe's seminal paper from
December 1980 entitled Symmetry and Local Maxima.  Here is a quote
from their paper.

   We will sometimes (particularly towards the end of this message)
   take the liberty of identifying a transformation with the position
   reached by applying that transformation to SOLVED.

Well, I am beginning to think that the source of my discomfiture
is simply that everybody does the same thing all the time, and that
nobody ever makes the identification explicit.  However, I think that
maybe the duality is there, whether the identification is explicit,
implicit, or not made at all.  Let me see if I can make clear what I
mean with some non-cubing programming examples.

When I first started computer cubing, I was struck by the fact that
(at least with my model of the cube), the computer code to implement
a permutation operation looked exactly like the computer code to
translate between various character codes.  For example, I have had
frequent occasion to translate between ASCII and EBCDIC (in both
directions).  The code to translate between the ASCII string X and
the EBCDIC string Y is something like

    for i = 1 to n Y(i) = T(X(i))

where T is the translate table.  To make this clear by an example,
the ASCII code for the letter A is  decimal 33 and the EBCDIC code
for the letter A is decimal 193.  Hence, the 33-rd position of T
contains decimal 193, and the 193-rd position of T' contains 33.

Beyond this simple little loop above, many (if not most) programming
languages have a function (often called TRANSLATE or TRANSFORM) which
does exactly the same thing.  There are also hardware architectures
which implement the TRANSLATE in hardware.  For example, you might
have something like

   Y = TRANSLATE(X,T)

where X is the string to be translated and T is the translate table.

X and T are clearly not interchangeable as input to the TRANSLATE
function.  However, (and repeating myself) I think there is an
essential duality between X and T.  For example, consider what
would happen if you reversed the role of X and T as follows.  Let X
be the hexadecimal string 010201020301020403.  Then,
Y = TRANSLATE(X,' ABC') would yield the string ' A AB ACB'.  Such
a role reversal for the "permutation operator" and "permutation operatee"
can be a very powerful programming technique.  For example, I have
used it to redistribute data, creating well-formatted print lines or
well-formatted display screens (text mode) with one fell swoop (with
only a single invocation of the TRANSLATE function).

I am going to continue reading, but perhaps I could pose a question to
Dan Hoey anyway:  is reversing the role of X and T in the TRANSLATE
function above essentially the same thing as switching between
pre-multiplication and post-multiplication?

I would not know sources for Rubik's Maze and Rubik's Hat.  They are on
sale in the local shops here.  I have looked, the distributer is no
longer Matchbox but Parker, so that would imply availability in the
US I think.

Subject:   Some Additional Distances in the Edge Group

It is now known that using the qturn metric, Start has a
unique antipode in the edge group, namely Mirror-Image-
of-Edges-Flipped.  The antipode is 15 qturns from Start.
Also, I have a complete data base of equivalence classes
in the edge group documenting the distance from Start for
each configuration of the edges.

It seems to me that given these two facts, some additional
distances can be determined.  For example, it is possible
to determine the distance from any configuration to
Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped.  Let Z be a sequence of operators
that converts Start to Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped, and let
A be any configuration of the edges.  Then apply Z' to A, look
up the result in the data base of distances from Start, and
that will be the distance from A to Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped.

The reason is quite simple.  Let P be a sequence which takes
Z'(A) to Start.  Then, Z'PZ takes A to Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped.
This is a very nice use of conjugates.

Another consequence of this result is the following:  suppose you
began with Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped and performed a
breadth-first exhaustive search.  Start would be antipodal, and
the number of nodes at each level of the tree would be identical
to the existing tree which begins at Start.

In addition, all of the above applies to Mirror-Image-of-Start
and Edges-Flipped with respect to each other.  They are
mutually antipodal, and are 15 qturns apart.  A tree built with
either at the root would have exactly the same number of nodes
at each level as the existing tree with Start at the root.

Finally, the distance of any configuration from Mirror-Image-of-Start
or Edges-Flipped can be determined.  Let Y be a sequence of operators
which converts Start to Mirror-Image-of-Start, and let X be a sequence
of operators that converts Start to Edges-Flipped.  Let A be any
cube.  Then, the distance of A from Mirror-Image-of-Start
is the same as the distance of Y'(A) from Start, and
the distance of A from Edges-Flipped is the same
as the distance of X'(A) from Start.

I have the sensation in describing this that the Edge group is
square, with Start and Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped 180 degrees
apart, and Mirror-Image-of-Start and Edges-Flipped at the other
two corners of the square.

I wish to propose an answer to Dan's question.  I will propose an
approximation then (hopefully) the exact answer.

The approximation is simply 4.3*(10^19) / 1152, or about
3.7*(10^16).  1152=24*24*2, and is based on my version of Dan's
M symmetry group.  I remain convinced that my version of M is
isomorphic to Dan's, but the subject deserves some more thought
and discussion.

But we can do better.  We already know (under my version of M) how
many equivalence classes there are for the corner group (namely,
77,802).  But each of the equivalence classes for the corners can
be rotated 24 ways with respect to the centers, so we have
77,802*24.  We also already know (under my version of M) how many
equivalence classes there are for the edge group (namely
851,625,008).  But each of the equivalence classes for the edges
can be rotated 24 ways with respect to the centers, so we have
851,625,008*24.  Hence, we have

   (77,802*24) * (851,625,008*24) = 38,164,682,230,511,620

This figure is gratifyingly close to 3.7*(10^16), and I believe it
is the correct answer to Dan's question.  It is slightly larger
than the approximation because some of the equivalence classes
have fewer than 1152 elements, and  consequently there are a few
more equivalence classes than the approximation suggests.

However, the alert reader should have noticed a problem.  Why did I
not divide by 2 to take into account the fact that odd edge
permutations can only occur with odd corner permutations and vice
versa?  Actually, I did, but the division by 2 cancelled.  The reason
it canceled is slightly tricky.  Also, remember that we are talking
about equivalence classes, not specific cube configurations.  Any
equivalence class has both even and odd members, depending on how
the members are rotated.  Hence, any corner equivalence class can be
matched up with any edge equivalence class, assuming the rotations
are compatible.  But you still have to worry about "dividing by 2",
as follows.

Let G be the number of states of the whole cube without M, namely
the 4.3*(10^19) figure, and similarly let C be the number of states of
the corners without M and let E be the number of states of the edges
without M.  Then, we have the trivial relation G = C * E / 2.
Here, the division by 2 does properly reflect the odd/even parity
of the corners vs. the edges.

Let Gm = G / (24*24*2), Cm = C / (24*24*2), and Em = E / (24*24*2).
Hence, G = Gm * (24*24*2), C = Cm * (24*24*2), and E = Em * (24*24*2).
What I have available (approximately) is Cm and Em, and what I want
is Gm.  Hence,

     Gm = G / (24*24*2)
     Gm = (C * E / 2) / (24*24*2)
     Gm = ((Cm * (24*24*2)) * (Em * (24*24*2)) / 2) / (24*24*2)
     Gm = (Cm*24) * (Em*24)

Therefore, I replace Cm by the real figure for the number of corner
equivalence classes, replace Em by the real figure for the number
of equivalence classes, and Gm becomes the real figure for the total
states of the cube.  The "division by 2" is in the formula, but it is
invisible because of all the cancellations.

It is pretty bad when you have to followup with
corrections to your own posts.  I hurried to complete the previous
post before lunch, and just didn't think clearly enough  --  till I
had time to think *during* lunch.  Let's try this again.

A qturn of the whole cube (a 90 degree rotation of the whole cube)
is odd.  However, if you think of a qturn rotation of the whole cube
as disjoint between edges and corners, a qturn rotation of the
corners is even, and a qturn rotation of the edges is odd.  Hence,
for any equivalence class of the corners under M, either the whole
equivalence class is even, or the whole equivalence class is odd.
For any equivalence class of the edges under M, half of the equivalence
class is even and half is odd.  Thus, any equivalence class of the
corners can occur with any equivalence class of the edges, but with only
half the members of the edge equivalence class  --  namely those with
the same parity.

I believe my calculations were correct, but a piece of the justification
was not.  I hope I am not still missing something.  You do have to
"divide by 2", and my calculations do indeed "divide by 2" as previously
described, but the parity of edges vs. the parity of corners was
incorrect in the previous post.

Subject:   Second Addendum - Size of Cube Group under M

I feel like I am pestering the list to death with corrections.

I still believe that the figure that I proposed for the size of
the cube group under M is correct.  The first post included
a "correct" but I think unsatisfactory explanation.  The second post
improved upon one point that was unsatisfactory in the first post.
Now, let's see if I can get it completely correct.

The size of the corner group under (my version of) M is known.
The size of the edge group under (my version of) M is known as
well.  Let C be the size of the corner group, and E be the size
of the edge group.  Remember, the elements of the groups are
equivalence classes induced by (my version of) M.  Here is an incorrect
formula for G, the size of the entire cube group under (my
version of) M.

   G = (C*24) * (E*24) / 2

The division by 2 is introduced to account for parity between the
corner group and the edge group.  But the value for G produced by
this formula is only half as big as it should be.  The problem is
that M induces equivalence classes based on both rotations and
reflections, not just base on rotations.  Hence, we are led to the
following (still incorrect) formula:

   G = (C*24*2) * (E*24*2) / 2

As before, the division by 2 takes care of parity between the corner
group and the edge group.  In addition, the multiplication by 2 takes
care of reflecting each group.  But the value for G produced by this
formula is twice as big as it should be.  The problem is that while
any corner rotation can occur with any edge rotation (subject to
parity), you must either reflect both groups, or else reflect neither
group.  Thus, we have the following (correct) formula:

   G = ((C*24) * (E*24) / 2) * 2

The division by 2 takes care of parity between the groups, and the
multiplication by 2 takes care of reflection of the two groups
as a unit.  If we wish, we can cancel the multiplication and the
division to yield

   G = (C*24) * (E*24)

This is the same formula I originally posted, and I did say in the
original post that the division by 2 cancelled out.  However, I
think that this post provides a better explanation of the
cancellation than did the original post.

This is the first process I have found for the antipodal of Start
in the edge group (edges without corners and without centers).
There are certainly many more, but I have not yet cataloged them
all.

  FR'LFL'B'R'FL'FRBL'BL'

Note that this process (as with any process for the antipodal) is
its own inverse.  Hence, you can use it once to get from Start to
the antipodal, and again to get from the antipodal to Start.  Also,
the "natural" inverse (namely, LB'LB'R'F'LF'RBLF'L'RF') is also
a process which will go in either direction, Start to the antipodal,
or antipodal to Start.

I missed it on the 5x5 because my program was fast enough that I didn't
look further.  When I modified my program to try the 10x10 last week, I
did come up with the ordering Jan suggests.  It shaved about 1/3 the
running time off my 5x5 search, but it actually doesn't seem to make
that big a difference in the 10x10.

It turns out the 10x10 search isn't quite as bad as I thought, because
the tree does get trimmed rather early.  When a piece is constrained on
two edges, there are on average only 2/3 choices for that piece.  I've
got my program chugging along, and so far it has eliminated 4 of the 96
choices for piece (w/ orientation) for the upper left corner.  There are
4896 choices for the first 4 points in the search order, and it's going
through one choice per 25 minutes on average, so it'll finish in a mere
3 months, if I have the patience for it.  (I may try to dig up some
otherwise idle workstations to leave running over the holiday break.)

Your concept is theoretically extendable to the 10*10 tangle, but even
with this optimisation the puzzle would take a long time to solve. How
long do you take for the 5*5 Tangle on your computer?

I am sorry to say I haven't implemented the search yet.
The 5x5 is solved, so that isn't that interesting anymore; the 10x10
has such a huge search space, that it will need a very efficient
algorithm and/or clever representation. I just haven't decided on the
representation yet. I did decide on the search order though.

[ Cube-Lovers,

  There has recently been a discussion on Usenet group rec.puzzles
  about some cube topics.  There were a few pieces of new information,
  such as that you can now get Ishi's 5^3 cubes in a lot of places (I
  got mine in Learningsmith's) for about $35.  Here's a message I sent
  that's relevant to some Cube-Lovers topics.

  By the way, I'm still working through Jerry Bryan's articles on his
  brute-force program and his approach to symmetry.  I hope to get a
  reply out soon.

I, too, found the 3^3 easier than the 4^3.  But I can imagine ways in
which a solver could find the 4^3 easier.  Let us first consider a 4^3
with the faces fixed, the edges together, and the correct simulated
edge flip parity.  I would solve this as if it were a 3^3, and a lot
of people do.  But another solver might find it easier to take
advantage of the extra moves that are not possible on a 3^3.  To take
a concrete example, it could be that the solver has a hard time with
flipping edges by pairs, as is needed to solve the 3^3.  On the 4^3
you can flip one edge at a time.  So the solver would find the 4^3
position easier than the corresponding position on a 3^3.  If the
solver finds this so much easier that it overcomes the difficulty of
putting the faces and edges together--or in fact puts the faces and
edges together in the course of solving the corners and the edge
positions--then the 4^3 could be easier.  It depends on the solution
procedure.

alan@saturn.cs.swin.oz.au (Alan Christiansen) continues:

This is interesting, as there is more than one way to model the
four-dimensional cube problem.  Consider the 3^4 cube.  It has eight
hyper-faces, each in the shape of a cube.  One model of this puzzle is
that you could turn any face of any hyper-face as if it were a face of
a 3^3 Rubik's cube.  In a second model, you cannot move part of a
hyper-face, but can turn each hyper-face as if it were a solid cube in
space.  A third model allows either kind of move.

These models are different from each other.  The second model permits
the face centers of the hyper-faces to move around, whereas in the
first model only edges and corners move.  In the first model, odd
permutations of corners are possible, which is not true in the second
model.  Of course, the third model is the closure of the first two.

According to Hofstatder's column reprinted in _Metamagical_Themas_,
there is an unpublished 1982 manuscript by H J Kamack and T R Keane
entitled ``The Rubik Tesseract''.  They calculated the size of the
group of the 3^4 puzzle, but I don't know which model was used.

Alan Christiansen indicates he has gone directly to the 4^4 puzzle.  I
don't know which model he plans, or if the models become more similar
with the extra possibilities inherent in the larger cube.  I don't
even know whether he plans to figure out how big the groups are or
whether they are identical.

Your question prompted me to actually write the program, and to
squeeze as much efficiency from the program as I could.

You wrote on december the 14th, your program took about 20 minutes
on a 486DX2-66,
Don Woods writes on the same date, that his program takes 45 seconds
on a SparcStation II,
And now I am proud to present my timing: trrrrr (drum roll)
7 seconds on a Compacq Deskpro 386/33. (and still only brute force!)
Now I am ready to try the 10x10.

Some thoughts in the mean time:

If the algorithm treats the duplicate pieces just as ordinary pieces,
i.e. as different, this will cause the program to find 4 solutions
for the 5x5 where only 2 exist (by exchanging the duplicate pieces).
This factor of 2 may not be dramatical, but if the same algorithm
tries the 10x10, then for every 1 solution that exists, the program
will find (5!)^4 x (4!)^20 identical versions (combinations of
duplicate exchanges).

My program views duplicate pieces as one, which may be placed several
times. So for some position X a piece with duplicates will only be
tried once.

Don Woods writes:
>Regarding solving the Tangle, I forgot one other minor optimisation:

My program prevents finding rotations of solutions, by excluding the
rotations of just one piece. The list of possibilities to try on any
position includes this one piece just once, and every other piece four
times. You can choose any piece for this, except the duplicated one.
Regrettably this approach works only for the 5x5: the 10x10 will
probably have to use Don Woods method.

Subject:   Withdrawal of Proposal

I wish to withdraw, for the time being, my proposed answer to Dan
Hoey's question about how large is the cube group when symmetries
are taken into account.  Notwithstanding two rounds of "correction",
I believe my proposal is fundamentally incorrect, and it will take
some time to come up with something better.

I believe that my proposed approximation is incorrect by a factor
of 24.  That is, my proposed approximation would be correct for
corners plus edges (without centers), but would need to be
multiplied by 24 in order to be correct for corners plus edges
(with centers).  My proposed approximation was
4.3 * 10^19 / (24*24*2).  I now believe it should be
4.3 * 10^19 / (24 * 2), with the former figure correct only if
centers are omitted.

Secondly, I believe that my proposed procedure to calculate an
exact value from the known sizes of corner and edge groups is
incorrect.  My procedure would be correct if all equivalence classes
had exactly 1152 elements.  But they don't.  It is not presently
clear to me whether the size of the equivalence classes when
corners and edges are combined can be calculated from the known
sizes of equivalence classes for corners and edges separately,
or whether a computer search will have to be performed for the
case where corners and edges are combined.

I will get back to this in a week or two.  In the meantime, my
apologies if I have wasted your time, and I look forward to
any words of wisdom that any of you all might have.

                Some thoughts on Local Maxima
                -----------------------------

   I have verified that the position I call "6 H order 2 type 2"
is a local maximum.

p175 6 H order 2 type 2  T2 B2 L2 T2 D2 L2 F2 T2              (8)

A rare example of a pattern with symmetry level 2, perhaps even
the only one of this type, and also the most symmetric of the
6 H patterns.

Nothing new here, as this was noted formerly by David Singmaster
in one of the Cubic Circulars and by Jim Saxe & Dan Hoey in the
archives.

Somewhat more interesting is the conclusion that the pattern
4 H order 2, or H's on the F,R,B,L faces (oriented like the
letter H) is also a local maximum, at least in the square's
group.

p160 4 H order 2 Type 2  B2 D2 (L2 R2 F2) ^2 T2 F2           (10)

From the archives:

> techniques other than exhaustive search.

Oh well, I used an exhaustive search. p160 is 10 moves long in the htw
metric, and each of the moves ( T2, D2, F2, B2, L2, R2 ) all bring
one to a position requiring nine 180 degree twists, thusly....

4 H + T2 =      L2, R2, F2   B2, T2, L2   R2, B2, F2   (9)
4 H + D2 =      L2, R2, F2   B2, D2, L2   R2, B2, F2   (9)
4 H + F2 =      B2, D2, L2   R2, F2, L2   R2, F2, T2   (9)
4 H + B2 =      F2, D2, L2   R2, F2, L2   R2, F2, T2   (9)
4 H + L2 =      R2, D2, L2   F2, B2, L2   F2, B2, T2   (9)
4 H + R2 =      L2, D2, L2   F2, B2, L2,  F2, B2, T2   (9)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I did discover an interesting property of the "Cube in a cube" pattern
I didn't notice before.

p7a  Cube in a cube   U2 F2 R2 U3 L2 D1 (B1 R3) ^3 B1 D3 L2 U3  (15)

Let's say you are entertaining some cube guests at a cube party and
the topic is (cube) patterns. Your guests are impressed with the
efficiency of the well-memorized process. You would like to go on
to the next pattern but you don't quite remember how the inverse
goes. No problem! Rotate the whole cube so TOP becomes BACK then
BACK becomes DOWN, and finally FRONT becomes RIGHT. Simply repeat
the process p7a and your reputation as a cube expert is saved. ;->

This same idea works for the 6 X order 3 pattern as well.

And now for an unsymmetric local maximum!!

Ok, before I meant rotate the cube in space in 3 steps so
that the TOP face becomes BACK, then the face that is the
BACK at this point becomes DOWN, and the face that is the
FRONT at this point becomes the RIGHT.

The reason I used this type of description is because there
are  multiple ways for the TOP to become the DOWN face....

TOP becomes BACK becomes DOWN and
TOP becomes RIGHT becomes DOWN and
TOP becomes LEFT becomes DOWN etc...

Perhaps it is better to use the form
old FACE A -> new FACE A
old FACE B -> new FACE B

Where the faces A & B are adjacent.

Subject: Group theory basics (Re: Symmetry)

Jerry Bryan <BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> asked a bunch of
questions a couple of weeks ago, and I'll try to get to them all.
The first bunch has to do with some fairly basic stuff, that I thought
had been pretty well understood since the beginning of the mailing
list, but maybe we need a refresher, or an explicit statement.

In the message of Tue, 14 Dec 1993 20:50:51 EST, Jerry describes his
representation of cube positions and transformations.

That is the most usual way of doing it, but it's important to specify
what you represent by those vectors.  When I do it, I number the
corner facelet locations from 1 to 24, and these locations retain
their numbers through manipulations of the cube.  I use a vector A to
specify a position in which the facelet whose home location is i has
been moved to location A(i), for each i.  I use a vector P to specify
the transformation that moves the facelet in location i to location
A(i), for each i.  I'll assume you're doing the same, though you
could, for instance, be representing the inverse of the operators, or
the locations from which the facelets originate.  Note that a position
is represented by the same vector that represents the transformation
that takes SOLVED to that position.

I would write this as B = P A, and say that A is premultiplied by P,
or equivalently that P is postmultiplied by A.  In a general group, we
could have B = P A where the multiplication is not considered to be
the composition of permutations.  But it turns out we can restrict our
attention to permutation groups without loss of generality.  For
instance, when we are dealing with the supergroup, we can consider the
orientation of a face center to be a permutation of the corners of the
face center.

>     2)  For i = 1 to 24  B(i) = P(A(i))

Here B = A P, A is postmultiplied by P, and P is premultiplied by A.
(Note that the operator or position name appears in the reverse order
from the prefix format.  Algebraists sometimes avoid this by writing
(i)B = ((i)A)P.  I kid you not.)

> (As an aside, this illustrates the question I raised in my previous
> post about "which is the operator and which is the thing being
> operated on?"  Is P operating on A, or is A operating on P?)

Well, the answer is ``both''.  I agree it's easy to get confused,
which is why proofs are a good idea.

> Q2 is the reflection), then we have

>       For j = 1 to 24 for k = 1 to 24 for m = 1 to 2
>              for i = 1 to 24 Bj,k,m(i) = Qm(Pj(A(Qm(Pk(i)))))

> I believe this loop calculates Dan Hoey's M.

On the the theory that proofs are a good idea, let's see what this
loop calculates.  I'm going to put brackets around the subscripts.
Then I'll substitute "R" for "Q", because I use Q for the set of
quarter-turns of faces.  Furthermore, I'll use "C" instead of "P",
because the P[j] are just the elements of C, the group of cube
rotations.  So you are computing

        B[j,k,m] = C[k] R[m] A C[j] R[m]                    (1)

for j in {1,...,24}, k in {1,...,24}, and m in {1,2}.  Now every
member of M (the group of cube rotations and reflections) has a unique
representation as M[n] = C[k] R[m].  Let us define Cind() and Rind()
as the functions for which M[n]=C[Cind(M[n])] R[Rind(M[n])].  So we
can write (1) as

        B[j,k,m] = M[n] A M'[n] (M[n] C[j] R[Rind(M[n])])

Note that (M[n] C[j] R[Rind(M(n))] must be an element of C.  So B is a
set of elements of the form M[n] A M'[n] C[o].  To see that we have
all such elements, first observe that (M[n]' C[o] R[Rind(M[n])]') is
an element of C, say C[j].  So equation (1) includes:

   C[Cind(M[n])] R[Rind(M[n])] A C[j] R[Rind(M[n])]
   = M[n] A (M[n]' C[o] R[Rind(M[n])]') R[Rind(M[n])]
   = M[n] A M'[n] C[o].

Thus the set of all B[j,k,m] is the set of all M[n] A M'[n] C[o].  Or
in English, that's the set of all M-conjugates of A, operated on by
all whole-cube rotations.

It's pretty common terminology.  You might be slightly better off
calling it a ``representative element,'' as that connotes that the
element is ordinary except in that it represents the equivalence class
(like representatives in the U.S. Congress).

This is straightforward once we show that M-conjugacy is an
equivalence relation, and B[j,k,m] is an equivalence class.
If A ~ Representative[A] = Representative[B] ~ B, then by transitivity
A ~ B.  Conversely, if A ~ B, then Class[A] = Class[B], and therefore
Representative[A] = Representative[B].  This shows that the criteria
are equivalent.

What you have done is to increase the size of the whole cube problem
by a factor of 24, by dealing with all rotations of the cube, and the
equivalence classes expand by the same factor, from 48 to 1152.  This
has allowed you to calculate something like M-conjugacy classes for
cube problems that lack face centers.  But the size of the equivalence
classes doesn't shrink the problem for cubes that have face centers.
You could have just calculated M-conjugates and got the same answer.

> I am not sure if this answers Dan's question about my model
> with centers added.

It's clear now.  I hadn't realized you were rotating the cube in space
when the face centers were present.  I expected that to be a wasted
effort.  But I am impressed by the way it allows you to shrink the
database by storing positions together that differ only by whole-cube
moves of the face centers.  I think it should be possible to shrink
the database without the effort, though.

In your message of Thu, 16 Dec 1993 15:36:58 EST, on the ``Duality of
Operators and Operatees'':

It is hard to keep it straight.  Sometimes we all get it wrong.  The
best way to avoid errors, as far as possible, is to avoid such
language and talk about group multiplication.  But then we have to
explain what is going on with the cube, so we get caught into talking
about operators again.  It's a discomfort that must be endured.

There is quite a bit of confusion about this.  When permutation
groups are considered; even text-books do not agree.  When A and P
are permutations you can find both that P A means: apply P first, A next,
but also: apply A first, P next.  (The first meaning comes from the pure
group theorists, the second meaning more from the algebra inclined.)

Sorry to confuse the issue, but when I read such texts I have always to
think hard to get at the intended meaning.  I think the functional
notation is much clearer and leads to less confusion.

Of course, doing notations for cube rotations the group theorists
notation is applied, but when doing abstract operations...

Subject: Re: Some Additional Distances in the Edge Group

In his message of Fri, 17 Dec 1993 00:54:00 EST, Jerry Bryan
<BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> makes some observations on the
distances between the following positions in the edge group:

    I = Solved,
    P = Pons Asinorum (or Mirror),
    E = All edges flipped, and
    PE = P E = Pons Asinorum with all edges flipped.

[I _will_ continue to use permutation multiplication as we have done
so in this group since its inception.  I realize that this agrees with
some textbooks and is backwards from others, but it would be far more
confusing to write these functionally all the time.]  Jerry's
brute-force search has shown that d(I,PE)=15, and he notes that
conjugation by E shows us that d(P,E)=15 as well.  He concludes:

> I have the sensation in describing this that the Edge group is
> square, with Start and Mirror-Image-of-Edges-Flipped 180 degrees
> apart, and Mirror-Image-of-Start and Edges-Flipped at the other
> two corners of the square.

Well, it's not quite a square, since d(I,P)=12 and d(I,E)=9, according
to Jerry's message of Wed, 8 Dec 1993 10:02:15 EST.  Conjugation will
similarly show that d(E,PE)=12 and d(P,PE)=9.  So we are dealing with
a rectangle.  The sides of the rectangle are 9 and 12, and the
diagonal is 15: a most fortuitous set of numbers, in that we can
actually embed such a rectangle in the Euclidean plane!

We can map the positions of the edge group to 4-tuples of distances.
For any position X, let

    f(X)=(d(I,X), d(E,X), d(P,X), d(PE,X)).

If f(X)=(a,b,c,d), then conjugation shows us that f(X E)=(b,a,d,c),
f(X P)=(c,d,a,b), and F(X PE)=(d,c,b,a).  So the set of quadruples has
the symmetries of the rectangle.

We know f(I)=(0,9,12,15).  What is more, the earlier results on
symmetry show us that I is at a local maximum distance from E, P, and
PE.  So, letting I1 be the unique (up to M-conjugacy) position
adjacent to I, we have F(I1)=(1,8,11,14).  (This destroys Euclidean
embeddability.)  An analogous result holds for the unique neighbor of
each corner of the rectangle.

We also have Jerry's results of Wed, 8 Dec 1993 22:41:28 EST and
23:16:50 EST that H (the 6-H pattern) and HE=H E are at distances 8
and 13 from start, respectively.  Since H is an M-conjugate of P H,
this gives us f(H)=(8,13,8,13).  [Note: there are two distinct
M-conjugates of H, call them H and Hbar.  This distinction is
important when we compose permutations: H H = I, but H Hbar = P.  So
we have to be careful when conflating M-conjugates.] We can by
symmetry find f(H1)=(7,12,7,12) for H's unique neighbor H1.

What quadruples are possible?  If f(X)=(a,b,c,d), and X is not one of
the eight corners and neighbors, we have

         max(2,9-b,12-c,15-d) <= a <= min(14,9+b,12+c)

with constraints on b, c, and d from symmetry.  A quick hack tells me
there are 7836 such quadruples.  I wonder how many of them are
realized?  If it's fairly few, I would like to see a diagram of
quadruples, with lines between those quadruples that represent
adjacent positions (adjacent quadruples differ by at most one in each
coordinate).  Maybe with the number of positions for each quadruple,
too.  I have an idea that such a diagram might tell us something about
the problem, or at least look pretty.

That will serve to uniquely identify a rotation, but it's somewhat
verbose.  Worse, it does not suffice to uniquely identify a symmetry
from the group of rotations and reflections, M.  I find it's far more
informative to identify a rotation or reflection as a permutation of
the faces, in cycle format.  There are only ten kinds:

Even rotations:          I=Identity (1),
                (FRT)(BLD)=120-degree rotation (8),
                  (FB)(RL)=180-degree orthogonal rotation (3).

Odd rotations:      (FRBL)=90-degree rotation (6), 
              (FB)(TR)(DL)=180-degree diagonal rotation (6).

Even reflections: (FR)(BL)=diagonal reflection (6),
                (FRBL)(TD)=90-degree glide reflection (6),
                  
Odd reflections:      (FB)=orthogonal reflection (3),
                  (FRTBLD)=60-degree glide reflection (8),
              (FB)(RL)(TD)=central reflection (1).

In case it isn't clear, the cycle notation for (e.g.) a 120-degree
rotation (FTL)(BDR) means that the F, T, L, B, D, and R faces move to
the T, L, F, D, R, and B, locations, respectively.  The only thing I'm
afraid of with this notation is that someone will think I'm describing
a magic-cube process rather than a whole-cube move.

So when you say Top->Down, Front->Left, I would say (TD)(FL)(BR) for
the 180-degree diagonal rotation, to distinguish it from (TD)(FLBR)
the 90-degree glide reflection.

> ....wait a second, I don't think faces A & B have to be

No, you're back to your original bogosity.  Knowing the destinations
of two opposite faces doesn't give you any more information than
knowing the destination of one (unless you go breaking the axles).

Subject: Correction Re: Some Additional Distances in the Edge Group

A couple of days ago, I said that proofs are a good idea.  I'll say it
again today with a redder face.

Yesterday I discussed the edge group positions

    I = Solved,
    P = Pons Asinorum (or Mirror),
    E = All edges flipped, and
    PE = P E = Pons Asinorum with all edges flipped

and the function from the edge group to 4-tuples of distances

    f(X)=(d(I,X), d(E,X), d(P,X), d(PE,X)).

I wrote:

?? If f(X)=(a,b,c,d), then conjugation shows us that              ??
?? f(X E)=(b,a,d,c), f(X P)=(c,d,a,b), and F(X PE)=(d,c,b,a).     ??
?? So the set of quadruples has the symmetries of the rectangle.  ??

The first sentence is incorrect, though the argument as a whole is
reparable.

First, I'll do what I should have done yesterday, and define the
distance function d(X,Y).  We want the minimum length process Z such
that X Z = Y.  But premultiplying both sides by X', we have Z = X' Y.
So I define d(X,Y)=Length(X' Y).  From the properties of the length
function (Length(I)=0, Length(X)=Length(X'), and
Length(X Y)<=Length(X) + Length(Y)) we can conclude that d(X,Y) is a
metric.

Suppose f(X)=(a,b,c,d).  I claim f(E X)=(b,a,d,c), f(P X)=(c,d,a,b),
and F(PE X)=(d,c,b,a).

Proof: To show f(E X)=(b,a,d,c), first observe that I=I', E=E', and
P E = E P.

    d(I,E X) = Length(I' E X) = Length(E' X) = d(E,X),
    so d(E,E X) = d(I, E E X) = d(I,X);
    d(P,E X) = Length(P' E X) = Length((PE)' X) = d(PE,X)
    so d(PE,E X)=d(P,E E X)=d(P,X).

To show that f(P X)=(c,d,a,b), exchange P and E in the above argument.
To show that f(PE X)=(d,c,b,a), use both occurrences of the argument.
QED.

So the idea of yesterday's message is correct, but I had X E, X P, and
X PE instead of E X, P X, and PE X, respectively.  I would show you a
counterexample to yesterday's formulation, but it turns out there is
none.  I claim that f(X,E)=f(E,X), f(X,P)=f(P,X), and f(X,PE)=f(PE,X).

Proof: Recall that E commutes with every element of the Rubik cube
group, so f(X E)=f(E X).  It turns out that ``up to M-conjugacy'', P
commutes with every element of the edge group as well.  For P performs
a mirror-reflection of the edges, and so can be regarded as an element
of M acting on the edge group.  So P' X P = Xbar is an M-conjugate of
X, and X P = P Xbar.  Since Length(X) agrees on M-conjugates, so does
d(X,Y), and so f(X), so f(X P)=f(P Xbar) = f(P X).  Finally,
f(X PE) = f(X P E) = f(E X P) = f(P E X) = f(PE X). QED.

So it turns out it that the statement about f was true.  But I am no
less embarrassed for asserting it, for I had no reason to think it
would be true.  It's only rescued by the surprising commutativity of
the Pons Asinorum.

Finally, I would like to note something that I nearly included in
yesterday's message, but yanked when I decided it was false:
f(X')=f(X).  Now I'll prove it:

Proof:  For W among {I,E,P,PE}, we have X W = W Xbar, for Xbar an
M-conjugate of X.  So
     d(X,W)=Length(X'W)=Length(W'Xbar')=Length(W'X')=d(W,X').
QED.

Content-Length: 1000

Hm.  Well, I split up the 10x10 Tangle exhaustive search and ran it on
several machines over Christmas break, getting the 90 days of compute
time done in about 10.

And turned up no solutions.

There could of course be a bug in my program, but the same code with
minor changes finds the same solutions as others have found for the 5x5.
I also tried adding some extra tiles for the 10x10, and it began finding
solutions okay.  I did doublecheck that the 100 tiles matched the info
posted to Cube-Lovers re which tiles are duplicated in the four 5x5s;
I have no way of checking whether that info was correct.

Has anyone out there ever heard definitely that someone has found a
solution to the 10x10?  Is it possible that the makers of Tangle (Matchbox,
using Rubik's name under license) merely claimed that such a solution
exists, without actually verifying it?  (Seems pretty sleazy if so,
but then, having Tangles 2-4 be merely color permutations of #1 is
pretty weak in the first place.)

As I wrote before, I have embedded in my memory that there is an easy
argument that the 10x10 is *not* solvable.  I do not know whether I
found it myself (and ever did mail it to other people) or whether I
found it somewhere on the net; it is a long time ago.  When I find the
time I will do a check.  (I know very sure that I have had a program
running at that time but that I abandoned the search because it would
be fruitless.)

Yes, very probable.  You should never trust the number of solutions the
manufacturers give.  Sometimes it is much more, in this case it is less.
An actual example is a puzzle that consists of of nine rings (eh, this
is from memory, I do not have access to the puzzle at this time).  Five
rings contain digits; three rings contain operators; one ring contains
equal signs.  All in four positions around the rings.  The idea is to
create correct sums (like 5 + 1 - 4 + 1 = 3) on all four positions of the
rings.  The claim was that there was only a single solution.  Actually
there are many.  If there is interest I can hunt down the rings and
describe them in more detail.  (An interesting detail is that my father
was the first to find the puzzle; he had correct solutions like:
1 + 3 : 2 + 1 = 3.  He was a physicist.  The accomanying leaflet did not
give details about operator priorities.  Hence it actually makes two
puzzles; one with regards to priorities, the other just going left to
right.)

Indeed, the mass manufacturers are sleazy.

Cheers.

I will mail when I find back the argument disallowing 10x10.

My program is a bit faster, but as I have less machines at my disposal

Up until now they did not produce a solution either. I am starting

I have the puzzles myself, and checked the info in the message from
Dale I Newfield (15 Dec 1993), which quotes the archives.
I can assure you: those are indeed the duplicate pieces.

I thought about that too, but considered that the choice for precisely
those four duplicate pieces could be dictated by the desire to have
a solution for the 10x10.

>I also tried adding some extra tiles for the 10x10, and it began finding

Question: did you add pieces at random, or did you add more duplicate
pieces?
In the latter case you may have found the duplications that should have
been made to get a solvable 10x10.
That in turn would show there could not exist an argument disallowing
10x10 (as claimed by Dik Winter), unless that argument is based on the
particular colouring of the four duplicated pieces...

Incidentally, I would be interested in seeing your program.  (And am

I just gave it 5 of each piece, instead of 4 of most pieces and 5 of some.
It churned out positions pretty quick that way!  But since this involved
giving it more than 100 tiles to draw from, it says nothing about Dik Winter's
claimed impossibility proof.

It's a shame, really.  I'll bet that it would be possible to come up with
four Tangles that (a) really are different instead of being simple color
permutations of each other, (b) each have a unique solution (not counting
rotations) instead of two, and (c) can be combined to form a 10x10 that has
a unique solution.  Well, strike the "unique" from (c) and I'd make the bet;
but with the "unique" I certainly wouldn't bet against it!

When you limit yourself to 4 ropes with 4 colours, you always get 24 pieces,
and when you want to build a puzzle of 25 pieces, you will have to duplicate
one, which causes (a).
Using 5 colours instead, creates a set of 120 pieces, from which you could
probably pick 25 pieces (without duplication) which would satisfy both (a)
and (b), and probably 4 such sets could be found to satisfy (c) as well,
but such a puzzle would be less attractive, because the choice of 25 from
120 is somewhat arbitrary, and a puzzler would probably be more inclined
to use all 120 pieces... Of course it is all a matter of taste.

Not so.  There's nothing that says all permutations must be present.
Back in '92 when I first wrote the program to solve Tangle #1, I fiddled
with it a bit and found that removing a particular tile and adding a
duplicate of a second particular tile caused the solution to become
unique.  It didn't take long to find such a combination, so I'm confident
there are many many more that have unique solutions.

Hm, using just the set of 24 distinct tiles, I wonder if it's possible to
tile the faces of a 2x2x2 cube such that colors match at the edges of the
cube as well as within the faces?...

Well, a pleasant surprise!  It _is_ possible to take a set of 24 distinct
tiles from any Rubik's Tangle, and use them to tile the surface of a 2x2x2
cube such that all touching ropes match.  And the solution is unique!

I'll include the solution below, after some blank lines to avoid spoiling it
for anyone who wants to try solving the puzzle without seeing the answer...

First, a hint.  If you look at any face of the cube, and look at the two
pairs of colors at any edge of that face, the two pairs will be the same.
That is, if one tile touches a cube edge with colors red-blue, the adjacent
tile on that face touching the same edge will also touch the edge with red-
blue.  I see no obvious reason why the solution should have this property,
but it does.

Solution below.

Solution: Note that there is also a correlation between the color pairs that
occur within a face, and the color pairs that occur at the edges of that face.
Also, the orientation of every tile is the same relative to the adjacent of
the cube that the tile touches.  This makes it relatively easy to reconstruct
the solution manually.

WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE WHAT YOU KNOW WITH 
PRE-COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BY ELECTRONIC MAIL?

Recent estimates indicate that there are now more than 
300,000 classroom teachers from primary, middle, and 
secondary schools who hold accounts on the Internet.  
This makes a very special kind of learning available to 
them: one which directly involves subject matter experts 
communicating with students and teachers about their 
specialties, via electronic mail.

With support from the Texas Center for Educational 
Technology, we (at the University of Texas at Austin) 
have piloted and are now expanding an Internet-based 
service (the "Electronic Emissary") that brings together 
pre-college students, their teachers, and subject matter 
experts (SMEs) electronically, helping them to create 
telecomputing exchanges centered around the students' 
learning in the SMEs' disciplines.  For example, 
	
*  A class studying South America could learn about 
recent global environmental research results from a 
scientist who studies rainforest deforestation in 
Brazil.  
	
*  A class studying geometry might "talk" electronically 
with Euclid, who is actually a mathematics professor.  
	
*  A class studying the future of education might 
converse with an emerging technologies specialist from 
California's Silicon Valley.  
	
*  A class studying American History might 
electronically interview Harry Truman, who is really a 
curator with the National Archives.  
	
*  A class exploring the rapidly-changing governmental 
structures that are emerging in what was once the Soviet 
Union might correspond with a group of graduate 
political science students at a university in the CIS.  
	
*  Or, a class reading _Huckleberry Finn_ might 
correspond with an African-American studies scholar 
about the repercussions resulting from the enacting of 
the Emancipation Proclamation.

In successive phases of the project, increasing numbers 
of SMEs or SME groups are needed to correspond regularly 
(approximately 4 times per week) with primary, middle 
school, or secondary students and their teachers (1 SME 
or expert group per class, study group, or "special 
student").  Each electronic exchange will begin with 
approximately 2 weeks of project planning via electronic 
mail between the SMEs and the teachers.  Communications 
with students will begin on mutually convenient dates, 
and will continue for previously-arranged periods of 
time, usually between 2 and 10 weeks.

Subject matter expert volunteers are sought in all 
disciplines, but there is immediate need for SMEs with 
expertise in:

~  gravity and satellite motion
~  heat transfer
~  Hitler's rise to power during World War II
~  the Indian Wars (1870's & 1880's)
~  20th century fragmentation due to weapons of war, 
   especially the atom bomb
~  Maya Angelou (and other women in literature)
~  Native American literature, specifically Cherokee
~  George Orwell's _Animal Farm_ & Russian revolutions
~  personal finance
~  geometry

==> participating in this project, please send

You may have noticed it yourself, but the solution you promised was missing
from your message. But I take your word for it that you found it, because
(sorry to spoil your scoop) a solution for the tangle-cube as you described
was published before in CFF (Cubism For Fun) the periodical of the NKC
(Nederlandse Kubus Club = Dutch Cubist Club). Contrary to what the name
suggests members are not solely interested in cubes.
Membership to that club is open to anyone interested in puzzles like these
and highly recommended! The periodical CFF is published in English, and
appears three or four times a year.

Not from the copy I got - though the lines in question weren't blank;
they each contained a dot.  Perhaps someone's mailer isn't doing the

Subject:   Which is the Real Start?

The net is so wonderful about answering questions, here are a few
more:

1. Take a standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, and remove the corner and
   center labels to make an Edges Cube.  (I am assuming that the
   underlying plastic is black.  If the underlying plastic is
   white and one of the colors on the labels is also white, the
   Edges Cube is not so pretty).  Scramble the cube.  Give it to
   a cubemeister to solve.  How will the cubemeister know if the
   cube is solved?  In other words, how will the cubemeister
   distinguish Start from Pons Asinorum?

   One answer is that the cubemeister cannot.  Unless the cubemeister
   saw the cube before it was scrambled, or unless the cubemeister
   was told which reflection of the colors was Start, there would
   be no way to tell.  Another answer is that either one is Start --
   that there are two Starts.   However, if you like this answer,
   and if you identify the identity with Start, you are in the
   disquieting situation of having a group with two distinct
   identities (grin!).

   It is obvious that this problem does not arise if the labels are
   left on the centers.  Almost as obvious is the fact that the
   problem does not arise if the labels are left on the corners, even
   if the labels are removed from the centers.  The corner group
   cannot be turned inside out by a reflection as can be the edge
   group.

2. As silly as my second answer is, it leads to a second question.
   Just what is the 2x2x2 cube?  Or more correctly, how do you
   know when it is solved?  With any size of cube, if you restrict
   yourself to quarter-turns, by definition you cannot rotate the cube
   in space as a single operation.  Yet, a simple quarter-turn sequence
   such as RL' does rotate the 2x2x2 cube because it is faceless.  Is
   Start of the 2x2x2 operated on by RL' solved?  If so, you can argue
   that the 2x2x2 has 24 Starts.  Most people would not.  They would
   argue that there is only one Start, and that 2x2x2 cubes that differed
   only by a rotation are equivalent.

3. Combining #1 and #2, I *think* that most people would argue that
   Start and Pons Asinorum on the Edge Cube are not equivalent,
   but that simple rotations of the 2x2x2 are equivalent.  If I am
   correct about "most people", why?  Is a rotation symmetry
   intrinsically a stronger or weaker symmetry than a reflection
   symmetry?

4. When I was first posting my results about the Edge Group, and
   particularly when it first began to sink in what the four equivalence
   classes with only 24 elements really were, I had a moment of
   panic.  Since Start and Pons Asinorum differ only by a simple
   reflection, why had not my version of M-conjugation declared them
   to be equivalent?  (I speak of "my version of M-conjugation", but
   the question is no different if you look at Dan Hoey's original
   M-conjugation).  I think I know the answer, but I will leave the
   problem as an exercise for the student.  Furthermore, I think the
   answer to #4 is really the same as the answer to #3.

5. What is a reflection, really?  Here is an exercise to illustrate
   the question.  Take two identically colored and oriented 3x3x3
   cubes.  On one, perform F and on the other perform F'.  Examine
   the two cubes, plus their images in a mirror.  Why are there
   four distinct cubes rather than only two?  At one level of
   abstraction, the answer is simple.  Of the four, one is not
   reflected, one is pre-reflected, one is post-reflected, and one
   is both pre- and post-reflected.  Is this a sufficient answer,
   or is there something deeper?

   At this point, I can't help but note Martin Gardner's famous
   mirror question in Scientific American many years ago:  why
   does a mirror reverse left and right but not up and down?

6. I found Dan Hoey's postings about the four special states of the
   Edge Group to be delightful.  Some of the results were based on
   a computer search of the group, for example the fact that
   f(I)=(0,9,12,15) could only reasonably be determined from a
   computer search.  However, the thought occurred to me that most
   of Dan's results were independent of the computer search, and
   I was curious precisely which results would stand without the
   search?  For example, if we identified the group as being
   rectangular, would we be led to saying which of the four special
   states were diagonally opposed without the computer search?
   Without the search, I might be tempted to say that Start and
   Pons Asinorum were diagonally opposed.

I am hardly more than a dilettante of the Cube, but I can perhaps offer
a few suggestions, since this seems to me to be largely psychology and

Obviously, it is correct to state that without some a priori knowledge
of the cube's coloring, the cubemeister cannot tell.  As for whether
you call them both Start:

Not at all.  All you have to do is consider the group elements to be
equivalence classes under not only whole-cube rotation but also
reflection.

If you take a(n ordinary) cube and rotate the whole thing a
quarter-turn, the result is not essentially different from the
original - most programs and virtually all humans would consider them
"the same".  Taking the stand that Start and P.A. are the same on the
Edge Cube means only that on the Edge Cube you consider a single group
element to consist of not only a position and all those reachable by
whole-cube rotations, but also those reachable by reflections as well.
The group-theoretic identity is then neither Start nor Pons Asinorum,
but rather the equivalence class containing both those (and 46 other
elements).

When you have achieved any of the 24 elements of the class that we lump
together as Start.

I'd argue the 1x1x1 breaks this statement :-)

What's more, it's not clear what "quarter-turn" includes: it usually
doesn't include slice turns on the 3-Cube, but on the 4-Cube and
higher, they must of necessity be included.

Yes, I would say so.  I would hope most people would.

Right.  I would say that RL' produces a cube that is precisely as
solved as that produced by RR' is - that on the 2x2x2, R and L are in
some sense the same thing.  My position would be that there is only one
Start on the 2-Cube, and it is an equivalence class with 24 members.

> 3. Combining #1 and #2, I *think* that most people would argue that

I would say that Start and Pons Asinorum on the Edge Cube can be looked
at as mathematically equivalent (though they need not be, if you
choose) but are not intuitively equivalent.  Physical objects generally
cannot be turned into reflected versions of themselves; they normally
*can* be turned into rotated versions of themselves.  Thus, rotations
"feel" equivalent, but reflections don't.

I'm too lazy to answer this; I no longer have the messages describing
exactly what your M-conjugation operation is online.  Presumably, you
implemented some intuitively-reasonable operation, and it produced
identical results for rotations but not reflections.

> 5. What is a reflection, really?

Ouch. Mathematically, this is easy enough: given a center of reflection
P in Cartesian 3-space, one computes the reflection of a point p as
P+(P-p).  All the things one thinks of as reflections can be
represented as this operation compounded with rotation and/or
translation.

There are certainly four cubes - or at least four cube images.  For
there to be only two distinct cubes, one would have to identify some of
them with one another.  However, the only operations (on the cube as a
whole) that will allow identifying two of them are (1) reflection and
(2) recoloring.  If your mathematical treatment considers reflections
or recolorings to be equivalent, then mathematically, there are only
two distinct cubes.  Neither of these operations "feels" trivial,
though, so the four cubes all "feel" distinct.

Subject: Combining conjugacy classes

Last month Jerry Bryan <BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> posted a
sequence of articles about counting the number of M-conjugacy classes
of Rubik's cube positions.  Having calculated the number of conjugacy
classes of the corner and edge groups separately, his idea was to
combine these to calculate the number of conjugacy classes of the
entire group.  Eventually, he withdrew the calculation, after
realizing that he had not found enough information to determine the
answer.  This article is about how we might calculate the answer from
separate searches of the edge and corner groups.

My first idea is to formalize the concept of symmetry in the conjugacy
classes that Jerry used in his searches.  Recall that the conjugacy
class of a position X is defined to be the set of all positions m'Xmc,
where m is an element of M, the 48-element symmetry group of the cube,
and c is an element of C, the 24-element subgroup of M consisting of
rigid rotations of the cube in space.  The reason some positions have
more symmetry than others is that for some positions, there are
nontrivial elements m and c such that m'Xmc=X.  The way in which this
arises can be formalized as a kind of symmetry group of X.

For an edge-group position X, let CSymm(X) be the set of all f in M
such that X'f'Xf is an element of C.  First, I'll claim that CSymm(X)
is a subgroup of M [see proof 1, below].  Second, I note that CSymm(X)
is the set of all m in M such that there exists c in C with m'Xmc=X
[proof: m'Xmc=X iff X'm'Xm=c'].  Third, I'll claim that if m'Xmc=Y,
then CSymm(X) and CSymm(Y) are conjugate subgroups of M [proof 2].  So
when Jerry says that a position X has order-N symmetry, he is saying
that CSymm(X) has 1152/N elements.  But the identity of CSymm(X) has
more information than just its size, and I believe this information is
crucial if we are to combine symmetry groups.  It looks to me as if it
would be sufficient to record the conjugacy class of CSymm(X), and
there are only 33 possibilities.

Now the usual symmetry group of X, Symm(X), is defined to be the group
consisting of all f in M such that X'f'Xf=I [or, equivalently, Xf=fX.
Symm(X) is the largest group such that X is Symm(X)-symmetric, in the
sense of the Symmetry and Local Maxima article].  The first step in
combining the corner and edge sets is to calculate the symmetry groups
of the rotations of a position X, AllSymms(X)={Symm(Xc) : c in C}.
This corresponds to computing the symmetry groups of the edges-and-
centers group from the symmetry groups of the edges group.  I suspect
there is a way of computing this from CSymm(X), but I do not know it.
I am not even sure that AllSymms(X) is determined by CSymm(X).  One
useful experiment would be to calculate CSymm(X) and AllSymms(Xc) for
all elements of the corner group and see what the correspondence is.

Barring an ability to calculate AllSymms(X) from CSymm(X), we could
calculate AllSymms(X) directly.  This involves a great number of
calculations, though: 24 symmetry group calculations for each element
of the edge group.  My first thought was to try to split the problem
up further, to deal with the group of permutations separately from the
group of orientations.  But I abandoned this when I realized there is
a problem that shows up when we try this with the corner group.  The
permutation of the corners that takes each cubie to its antipode is
clearly M-symmetric, and no matter how we decide to measure
orientation, there is a way to perform this permutation leaving the
cubies in their `home' orientation.  But there is no way to compose
the two together in an M-symmetric way.  I suspect the same problem
arises in the edge group.

But there may be some help from the edge search available in calcu-
lating AllSymms(X).  For take a position Y in the edges-and-centers
group; Y is also a rotated position in the edges group, so Y=m'Xmc for
some X in Jerry Bryan's list.  So for f in Symm(Y), Y'f'Yf=I is an
element of C, so f is in CSymm(Y).  This says that Symm(Y) is a
subgroup of CSymm(Y), which is a conjugate of CSymm(X).  So if Symm(Y)
is nontrivial, then CSymm(X) will also be nontrivial.  So to find the
symmetry groups of the edges-and-centers group we need only look at
those positions that have nontrivial groups in Jerry's list (i.e. less
than order-1152 symmetry), as all the others will have Symm(Y)=I.  So,
Jerry, do you have the data on how many positions of the edge group
have less than order-1152 symmetry, and which positions those are?

So, on to finding the symmetry groups of the Rubik's group positions.
We need to calculate Symm(X) for every element X of the edges-and-cen-
ters group and Symm(Y) for every element Y of the corners-and-centers
group, while keeping track of the permutation parity of X and Y.  (The
permutation parity will be constant over each Symm(X), Symm(Y)).  The
symmetry groups in the Rubik's group will be the intersections of
symmetry groups of edge and corner positions of the same parity.  We
need not keep track of the particular positions here, only the numbers
for each parity and each (conjugacy class of) symmetry group.  I have
a program that could produce a table easily enough.  Recently, I took
a look in Paul B. Yale's _Geometry_and_Symmetry_ and it looks like
this is the sort of problem we could use the Polya-Burnside theorem
on.  Unfortunately, I don't understand it yet, and it looks like the
number of cases here might be too large to conveniently carry out by
hand.  So it would help to go after this problem computationally.

The rest of this article has the proofs for the claims I mentioned in
the second paragraph.
================================================================
Proof 1: Suppose f, g are elements of CSymm(X); it suffices to show
that f'g is an element of CSymm(X).
    X'(f'g)'X(f'g)=X(g'f)X(f'g)
                  =X'g'(Xgg'ff'X')fXf'g
                  =(X'g'Xg) g'f (f'X'fX) f'g,
                  =(X'g'Xg) (f'g)' (X'f'Xf)' (f'g).
Since we assumed f, g in CSymm(X), X'g'Xg and X'f'Xf must be in C.
(f'g)' and (f'g) are elements of M that are either both in C or
neither.  So the product is in C, so f'g is in CSymm(X).  Therefore
CSymm(X) is a group, QED.

Proof 2: Suppose Y=m'Xmc. First let f be an element of CSymm(X), so
that X'f'Xf is in C.  I will first show that m'fm is an element of
CSymm(Y).

Y'(m'fm)'Y(m'fm)=(m'Xmc)'(m'fm)'(m'Xmc)(m'fm)
                =(c'm'X'm)(m'f'm)(m'Xmc)(m'fm)
                =c'm'(X'f'X)(mcm'fm)
                =c'm'(X'f'Xf)(f'mcm'fm)
All of which are elements of M, with an even number in C. Therefore
the expression is in C, so m'fm is in CSymm(Y).

Now let g be an element of CSymm(Y), so that Y'g'Yg is in C.  Let
f=mgm', so f is an element of M such that m'fm is in CSymm(Y).  I will
show that f is an element of CSymm(X):

X'f'Xf=(mc)(mc)'X'(mm')f'(mm')Xf(f'mcm'fm)(f'mcm'fm)'
      =(mc)(m'Xmc)'(m'fm)'(m'Xmc)(m'fm)(f'mcm'fm)'
      =(mc)Y'(m'fm)'Y(m'fm)(f'mcm'fm)'
      =(mc)Y'g'Yg(f'mcm'fm)',

which is in C, so f is in CSymm(X).

I've shown that for every element f of CSymm(X), m'fm is an element of
CSymm(Y), and that every element of CSymm(Y) is m'fm for some f in
CSymm(X).  Therefore CSymm(Y)=m' CSymm(X) m, QED.

Subject: Re: Which is the Real Start?

Jerry Bryan <BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> has some more questions.

The problem is that we would not be dealing with a _group_ then, but a
collection of cosets of M.  Just as in the edge `group', we deal with
either    1) a less-symmetric group in which one of the edges never
moves, or 2) a larger group in which we distinguish positions that
differ by rigid motions of the cube, or
          3) a non-group in which we consider cosets--equivalence
classes of group #2, where group elements that differ by rigid motions
are equivalent.  You have got a lot of mileage out of working with
group #2 to save duplication among symmetries, then reducing to
non-group #3.  But what you lose is the group structure of the object
you are studying.  Instead, you have to work in the large group and
then deduce information about the cosets.  All in all, though, I'm
very glad of it, for the lost symmetries of group #1 were sorely
missed.

For most of the other questions, mouse@collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu
provides satisfactory answers.  However, strictly speaking we should
not call an equivalence class to be a group element (unless it is a
coset of a normal subgroup, and neither C nor M is normal in the large
group).  I'll admit I've also abused the term when considering
distances in the ``edge group'', as if all 24 rotations of a position
were the same element of some group.  But when we start dealing with
the distinction between fixed and movable cubes I think we need to
start being more careful.

[ mouse also mentions that quarter-turn ``usually doesn't include
  slice turns on the 3-Cube, but on the 4-Cube and higher, they must
  of necessity be included.''  I'll take that as an argument for
  eccentric slabism: a QT rotates any 1xNxN slab except a central slab
  of an odd-edged cube.  As opposed to cutism, where a QT consists of
  a rotation of part of the cube with respect to the other. ]

Other questions:
>  ...since Start and Pons Asinorum differ only by a simple
>  reflection, why had not my version of M-conjugation declared them
>  to be equivalent?

Your versino treats positions X,Y for which m'Xmc=Y (m in M, c in C)
as equivalent.  If you instead determine when m'Xmn=Y (m,n in M) you
would find them equivalent.  This is equivalent to changing the loop
in your version of M-conjugacy.

>             for i = 1 to 24 Bj,k,m(i) = Qm(Pj(A(Qm(Pk(i)))))

so that the two occurrences of Qm need not be the same.

No, I didn't use M-conjugation except for a cube with a fixed
orientation in space [or equivalently, with face centers].  So in the
original concept of M-conjugation that Jim Saxe and I put together,
Start and Pons Asinorum don't just differ by a reflection.

Well, really the `group' is in the shape of a sphenoid, a word I
learned yesterday for a tetrahedron whose three pairs of opposite
edges are equal.  [Or equivalently, a tetrahedron whose edges are face
diagonals of a rectangular prism.]  But it might be more accurate to
consider it as a large ball of string with a bunch of symmetries.
Calling it a rectangle or sphenoid may lead us to ignore the structure
that is not representable in Euclidean space.

Subject:   Square Brackets

This posting has very little to do with cubes of any sort, but I
think you may find it of interest anyway.  If not, you can just
delete it.

In his analysis of my operator which combines M-conjugation with
a whole cube rotation, Dan Hoey inserted square brackets to make
his exposition more readable.  And therein lies a story.

As it turns out, I had composed most of my original note at work,
and I had used square brackets.  Actually, I had used square
brackets to delimit the indexes for the rotation and reflection
operations, and I had used parenthesis to delimit the indexes for
the individual cells in the row vectors.  I wanted to make a
distinction between the two kinds of indexing.  Dan avoids the
necessity for a distinction by simply not detailing the
indexing of the individual cells.

Anyway, I completed the note at home.  Much to my dismay, all of my
square brackets had disappeared!  I pretty much understand the
problem.  My E-mail system is an IBM mainframe which uses EBCDIC as
its basic code. EBCDIC does not deal very well with square brackets.
There are at least two "standards" for encoding square brackets in
EBCDIC.

There are any number of ways to access an IBM mainframe, but the
native terminal support is 3270 terminals using EBCDIC.  Both at home
and at work, I use a PC running TN3270 to access our mainframe.
TN3270 is a 3270 version of TELNET.  However, the TN3270 I use at work
is considerably different from the TN3270 I use at home.  One TN3270
implements one of the square bracket standards, and the other
TN3270 implements the other.

For similar reasons, mail gateways often have difficulties with
square brackets.  They may have to translate EBCDIC to ASCII or
ASCII to EBCDIC, and it is difficult to know how best to set up
the translate tables.  My experience is that some gateways get it
"right" and others get it "wrong".  I therefore had a great fear
that if I posted my note with square brackets, that the square brackets
might appear as gibberish to at least some of you.  Thus, I sort
of temporized and faked the subscripts with upper and lower
case letters (e.g., Bk to mean B-sub-k), omitting square brackets
entirely.

It is probably no accident that old programming languages such
as FORTRAN and COBOL use parentheses for indexing.  These languages
originated in the 50's.  At that time, the dominant character
code was BCD, which did not include square brackets.  EBCDIC is just
extended BCD, and the original EBCDIC did not include square brackets,
either.  Square brackets are a latter day addition to EBCDIC, and
the implementation of square brackets in EBCDIC is inconsistent.

ASCII has always included square brackets.  "Modern" languages
(say, starting in the 70's) such as Pascal and C (and their
descendents) grew up in the ASCII world, and tend to use
square brackets for indexing and parentheses for function
arguments.  FORTRAN compilers to this day have difficulty figuring
out with things like Y=X(I) or Y=F(X)  -- which are functions and
which are subscripted arrays.  Also, Pascal and C tend not to
co-exist very well in the EBCDIC world because of these kinds of
character set difficulties.

There are several other characters with similar difficulties.  For
example, if G is the cube group, you might want to refer to the
size of the cube group as |G|.  But the delimiting vertical bars
can be very different between EBCDIC and ASCII.  Finally, FORTRAN
used ** for exponentiation.  More modern languages tend to use
some sort of up-arrow or carat.  But such characters don't
translate well between EBCDIC and ASCII.  For example, if I
write |G| = 4.3 * 10^19, it is highly problematic whether the
character between the 10 and the 19 which I am using to express
exponentiation will make any sense on your particular system.

For whatever it is worth, here are my home and work versions of
square brackets:

home left  square bracket  [[[[[[[ x'AD'
home right square bracket  ]]]]]]] x'BD'
work left  square bracket   x'BA'
work right square bracket  ÙÙÙÙÙÙÙ x'BB'

Subject:   An Alternate Analysis of B

Here is a definition.  If X is any cube, then the function B
is defined as B(X) = min (C[i] R[j] X R[j] C[k]) for i in {1 to 24},
j in {1 to 2}, and k in {1 to 24}, and where C is the set of rotations
of the cube and R is the set of reflections of the cube.  Then, two
cubes X and Y are said to be B-equivalent if B(X)=B(Y).  Note that
the B function calculates the "canonical form" or the "representative
element" of an equivalence class under M-conjugation and rotation of
the cube in space.

Dan Hoey already gave a thorough analysis of this situation.  I would
like to provide an alternative analysis which I hope to be equivalent
to Dan's.  My analysis will be fairly informal as compared to Dan's.

Here are a couple of preliminaries.  First, multiplication of
permutations is generally not commutative.  For example, if X is any
cube, then it is generally not the case that m'Xm=mXm', where m
is in M, the set of all cube rotations composed with reflections.
However, we can calculate all M-conjugates of X as B[n]=m[n]' X m[n]
for n in {1 to 48}, or we can calculate all M-conjugates of X as
B[n]=m[n] X m[n]'.  Either way, B will be the same set of cubes.  It
will be in a different order, but it will be the same set.  The reason
is that the set of all m[n] is the same as the set of all m[n]',
namely just M, but m[n] is in a different order than m[n]'.  This means
that as long as we are calculating all M-conjugates as opposed to
a specific M-conjugate, we can sort of "violate" the normal rules
about multiplication commutivity.

Second, if X is any cube, consider the set of all rotations of
X, namely B[i] = X c[i] for i in {1 to 24}, and where c[i] is in C,
the set of all cube rotations.  Having generated the set of all
rotations of X, we can rotate as many times as we wish, for example
B[j] = X c[i] c[j] for i in {1 to 24} and j in {1 to 24}, or even
B[k] = X c[i] c[j] c[k] for i in {1 to 24}, j in {1 to 24}, and
k in {1 to 24}.  No matter how many times we multiply, B will be the
same set, it will just be in a different order.  Conversely, if we
have any number of adjacent rotations in the multiplication, we can
eliminate all but one rotation, and B will be the same set, and again
will just be in a different order.

With the preliminaries out of the way, we note that the set of all
M-conjugates of X is generated as B[i]=m[i]' X m[i] for i in
{1 to 48}.  But we can also generate the same set in a different order
as B[i]=m[i] X m[i]' for i in {1 to 48}.  We can decompose M and
calculate all M-conjugates as B[i,j]=c[i] r[j] X r[j]' c[i]' for i in
{1 to 24} and j in {1 to 2}.

But r[1]'=r[1] (r[1] is the identity) and r[2]'=r[2] (the reflection
is its own complement).  So we have B[i,j]=c[i] r[j] X r[j] c[i]'
for i in {1 to 24} and j in {1 to 2}.  The set of all c[i] is the
same as the set of all c[i]' (just in a different order), so we
define i' as the index for which c[i']=c[i]'.  Hence the calculation
of an M-conjugate can be written as B[i,j]=c[i] r[j] X r[j] c[i']
for i in {1 to 24} and j in {1 to 2}.

Finally, we wish to multiply the M-conjugate by the set of all rotations,
so we have B[i,j,k]=c[i] r[j] X r[j] c[i'] c[k] for i in {1 to 24},
j in {1 to 2}, and k in {1 to 24}.  But as we noted in our second
preliminary note, we can collapse multiple rotations into one, and we
have B[i,j,k]=c[i] r[j] X r[j] c[k], and B will be the set of all
M-conjugates of X multiplied by all rotations.  I guess I am overusing
the letter "B" a bit, because the "B" function is simply the minimum
of the "B" matrix.  But in any case, we have shown that the "B" loop
in my program is simply calculating the set of all M-conjugates multiplied
by all rotations.  This is the exact result already proven by Dan Hoey,
but I found the above derivation a little easier to follow.

Subject:   Some Proposed Terminology

I wish to propose some terminology and definitions to make certain
concepts a bit more precise.  For example, when we are talking about
"corners only", it is not always clear whether we are talking about
"corners with centers without edges" or "corners without centers
without edges".  In this note, I have tried to be consistent with
previous usage on the list, but I welcome any historical corrections
that might be deemed necessary.

Let G be the standard cube group for the 3x3x3 cube, and let |G| be
the size G.  Hence, we have |G| = (8!(3^8)/3 * 12!(2^12)/2) / 2,
which is the famous 4.3 * 10^19.

Let GC be the corners with centers without edges group for the 3x3x3
cube, and let |GC| be the size of GC.  Hence, we have
|GC| = 8!(3^8)/3.  (I welcome a suggestion other than "GC" as the
name for this group.  I did not find one in the archives.)  This group
could be modeled by removing the edge labels from a standard
3x3x3 cube.

Let GE be the edges with centers without corners group for the 3x3x3
cube, and let |GE| be the size of GE.  Hence, we have
|GE| = 12!(2^12)/2. (As before, I welcome a suggestion other than
"GE" for the name for this group.)  This group could be modeled by
removing the corner labels from a standard 3x3x3 cube.

Note that |G| = |GC| * |GE| / 2.

Let G\C be the corners with edges without centers group.  I intend
for the notation to indicate G reduced by C, where C is the rotation
group for the cube.  It should be the case that |G\C| = |G| / 24,
but I want to return to this question a little later.  This group
could be modeled by removing the center labels from a standard
3x3x3 cube.

Let GC\C be the corners without edges without centers group.  This is
the 2x2x2 cube.  We should have |GC\C| = |GC| / 24, but again I want
to return to this question a little later.  In addition to being the
2x2x2 cube, this group could be modeled by removing the center and
edge labels from a standard 3x3x3 cube.

Let GE\C be the edges without corners without centers group.  We
should have |GE\C| = |GE| / 24, but again I want to return to this
question a little later.  This group could be modeled by removing
the center and corner labels from a standard 3x3x3 cube.

Let G\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for G.  In this case,
|G\M| is approximately 48 times smaller than |G|.  I believe that
when Dan Hoey asked in 1984 the question "how big is G, really?",
that he was really asking how big is G\M, and that he was asking
for the approximation to be resolved to an exact number.

Let GC\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for GC.  In this case,
|GC\M| is approximately 48 times smaller than |GC|.

Let GE\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for GE.  In this case,
|GE\M| is approximately 48 times smaller than |GE|.

Recall that B is the function which calculates the canonical form
for a cube under the composed operations of M-conjugation plus
rotation.  My  programs calculate equivalence classes under B.

Let G\B be the set of B-classes for G.  Let GC\B be the set of B-classes
for GC.  Let GE\B be the set of B-classes for GE.  So far, my programs
have built complete search trees for GC\B and GE\B.

Let Gx denote any of G, GC, and GE.  Then, we have Gx\B=(Gx\C)\M=(Gx\M)\C.
In English, we can decompose B into a multiplication by C and M (in
either order).

Also, note that Gx\C=(Gx\C)\C=((Gx\C)\C)\C=....  Similarly,
(G\M)\C=((G\M)\C)\C=....  In English, having reduced once by C, we can
reduce again by C as many times as we wish, but we simply get the same
set back again each time.

This notation can help us address the question of whether B actually
accomplishes a "times 48" or a "times 1152" reduction in the size of
the cube.  If we are dealing with Gx, then Gx\B is a "times
1152" reduction.  However, information is lost.  For example, consider
GC and GC\B.  GC is "corners plus centers", and B-reduction of GC
removes the centers and calculates M-conjugates of the corners.
But you really don't have the same problem any more because the centers
are gone.  If on the other hand we are dealing with Gx\C, then (Gx\C)\B
is a "times 48" reduction.  All we have really done is calculate
M-conjugates. The reduction by the C that is composed into B is duplicate
effort which accomplishes nothing.

I have come to realize that my program for the 2x2x2 actually models
GC (corners with centers without edges) rather than GC\C (corners
without centers without edges).  My program does not explicitly encode
the centers.  However, it encodes all eight corner cubies, and when
it makes qturns, any of the eight cubies can move.  Hence, rotational
information is encoded, even if the centers themselves are not explicitly
encoded.  If I wanted to model GC\C, I would have had to either model
only seven of the cubies, or else modeled all eight but moved only seven
of them.  Since what I really wanted was (GC\C)\M, and since what I had
was GC, I had to invent this funny B thing, where GC\B=(GC\C)\M.  If I
had been clever enough to model GC\C in the first place, I never would
have had to invent B.  Similar comments apply to my model for the edges.

To convince yourself that eight corner cubies model GC and seven corner
cubies model GC\C, just think about calculating |GC| and |GC\C|.
For |GC|, there are eight ways to pick the first cubie, seven ways to
pick the second cubie, and so forth yielding the familiar
|GC|=8!*(3^8)/3.  For |GC\C|, we let one of the cubies be fixed,
then there are seven ways to pick the second cubie, and so forth yielding
|GC\C|=7!*(3^7)/3, and |GC| = |GC\C| * 24.  Hence, the "corners of the
3x3x3" problem is 24 times larger than the "2x2x2" problem.

I will discuss the "times 24" reduction that is accomplished by
reducing by C in a followup note.

Subject:   Some Terminology Concerning B

I have started to use "B" to indicate various aspects of the
conjugacy class generated by m'Xmc.  The choice of B is sort
of an accident.  I used "B" in the program fragment which
I posted to the list, and Dan Hoey analyzed the program fragment.
I have called it "B" in my mind ever since.  However, I have used
B in several inconsistent ways.  This is a proposal to
rectify that inconsistency.

Let X be any cube.  Then the set of B-conjugacy classes of X is
the set of all m'Xmc for all m in M and all c in C.  We denote
this set as BClass(X).  B is the function B(X)=min(BClass(X)).

Note that we could have defined BClass(X) equivalently as the
set of all mXm'c, or as the set of all cm'Xm, or as the set of
all cmXm'.  It is in general not the case that
m'Xmc = mXm'c = cm'Xm = cmXm' for any fixed value of m and c.
(Quite the contrary!).  However, when we say "the set of all...",
the four ways of generating BClass(X) become equivalent.  This is
the justification for the assertion in a previous note that
Gx\B = (Gx\M)\C = (Gx\C)\M.

Two cubes X and Y are B-equivalent if BClass(X) = BClass(Y).
Equivalently, two cubes X and Y are B-equivalent if B(X) = B(Y).

|X| is the length of X (the distance of X from Start).  We have
|B(X)| = |X| for centerless cubes, but it is generally not the
case that |B(X)| = |X| for cubes with centers.  In fact, let
X and Y be cubes with centers such that B(X)=B(Y).  It is not
necessarily the case that |X| = |Y|.  For example, consider
the set GC of cubes with corners with centers without edges.
We have B(RL')=B(I), but |RL'|=2 and |I|=0.

|BClass(X)| is the number of elements in BClass(X).  If
|BClass(X)| = N, then X is said to have order-N symmetry.  (I
sincerely regret ever using this terminology.  As has been noted
on the list, it seems "backwards" somehow.  But given that this
usage exists, the value 1152/N is generally more useful than the
value N.)

We note the following:

  1. B(X) is a cube.

  2. BClass(X) is a set of cubes.

  3. B(B(X)) = B(X)

  4. BClass(B(X)) = BClass(X).

  5. Both X and B(X) are in BClass(X).

Subject:   Calculating |G\M|

Armed with Dan Hoey's note of 4 January "Combining conjugacy classes",
I wish to propose once again a procedure for calculating |G\M|, the
number of M-conjugate classes of G, which I think in some sense is the
"real" size of G.  My proposal draws *very* heavily on Dan's note.

My first (incorrect) proposal was based on the following idea.  By
computer search, we already have a database of GC\B and GE\B, the
corners and edges of G, respectively, reduced by B-conjugacy.  Hence,
we know |GC\B| and |GE\B|.  For each X in GC\B and each Y in GE\B,
we calculate BClass(X) and BClass(Y).  Then, we can combine
BClass(X) and BClass(Y) in all legal ways (minding parity considerations).
Call the combinations BClass(X) * BClass(Y).  For any fixed X and Y,
BClass(X) * BCLass(Y) is a set of cubes in G.  Hence we can calculate
(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M and |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M|.  My idea
then was just to sum |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M| over all values
of X and Y to calculate |G\M|.  And we know how many X's and Y's there are!
But, alas, |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M| is not the same across all X's and
Y's because, well because of symmetry.  All X's and Y's are not equally
symmetrical.  I was assuming that |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M| was
constant, and of course it is not.

My next (incorrect) proposal was never posted to the list.  It was
a slight improvement on the first idea.  We have a data base of all X's
in GC\B and of all Y's in GE\B.  For each X in GC\B and for each
Y in GE\B, we know |BClass(X)| and |BClass(Y)|.  (Actually, we don't.
I have to calculate it.  I have done so, and I have posted
summaries of those calculations.  However, I did not store
the order of the equivalence classes in the data base.  I kick myself
for not doing so, but this is a minor problem, so let us continue).

There are only 10 distinct values for |BClass(X)| and for |BClass(Y)|,
namely 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, 288, 384, 576, and 1152.  (By the
way, I have never figured out why it is *exactly* the same set of
values for both the corners and for the edges.  It is easy to see
why it is approximately the same set of values, but the structure
of the corners is enough different from the structure of the edges
that I see no obvious reason the set of values should be exactly
the same in both cases.)

Let GC[m] be the set of all X for which |BClass(X)| = m and let
GE[n] be the set of all Y for which |BClass(Y)| = n. Hence,
GC\B is partitioned into GC[m]\B for m=24,48..., and GE\B is
partitioned into GE[n]\B for n=24,48,...  Now, we form the sets
BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n] for all X in GC[m]\B and for all
Y in GE[n]\B, and for all legal values of m and n.  There will
be 100 such sets.

For any fixed X, Y, m and n, BClass(X)[m] * BCLass(Y)[n] is a
set of cubes in G.  Hence we can calculate
(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n])\M and |(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n])\M|.
My idea then was just to sum |(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n])\M|
over all X in GC[m]\B and over all Y in GE[n]\B to calculate
|(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n])\M|.  We know how many X's there are
in GC[m]\B and we know how many Y's there are in GE[n]\B, so the
calculation seemed possible.  I then intended to sum again over all
m and over all n, and I would be done.

But, alas, in order to perform the sum over all X and all Y, I
needed a theorem which I couldn't prove and which I now believe
is not true anyway.  I needed to be able to prove that for a fixed
m and n, that |(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n]| had the same value
for all X in GC[m]\B and all GE[n]\B.  For a while I thought it was
true, but right now I can't think of any reason why it should be.

But perhaps Dan Hoey comes to the rescue with his CSymm function.
I still need a theorem which I cannot (yet) prove, but I believe it
is true.  If it can be proven, my basic overall scheme can be
rescued.

In my second proposal, I used the values of all possible BClass
sizes as indexes  --  24, 48, 72...  It would perhaps be more
convenient to make these sizes a set {24, 48, 72, ...},
and to think of the indexes m and n taking on the values from
1 to 10, where the values from 1 to 10 index the set
{24, 48, 72, ....}.  With this understanding, all the above results
are valid, and the indexing is more convenient.

We can now say that GC\B is partitioned into GC[1]\B, GC[2]\B, ...
through GC\B[10] and similarly for GE\B.  Unfortunately, using
the B-equivalence class sizes to partition GC\B and GE\B did not
permit us perform the calculations we wanted to perform.  However,
suppose we partition GC\B and GE\B a different way, namely using
CSymm.  Suppose, for each X in GC\B and for each Y in GE\B,
we calculate CSymm(X) and CSymm(Y). (We would have to do this
by computer).  CSymm(X) and CSymm(Y) are sets, but there are only
a (relatively) small number of such sets.  Let each distinct value
CSymm(X) and CSymm(Y) be mapped to an index.  We can call such a
mapping function CSind, and we can calculate CSind(CSymm(X)) and
CSind(CSymm(Y)).  Actually, there is no reason not to define
CSind in such a way that the domain is the set of X's and Y's, so
that we can calculate CSind(X) and CSind(Y).

Now, we use m=CSind(X) and n=CSind(Y) to form a partition of
GC\B and GE\B.  All our results from before are valid.  The only
issue is, can we now perform the sum?  In order to perform the sum,
we need the following to be true:

   For a fixed m and n, |BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n]| is constant
   for all X in GC[m]\B and all Y in GE\[n]\B, where GC[m] is
   the set of all X in GC such that CSind(X)=m and GE[n] is the set
   of all Y in GE such that CSind(Y)=n.

It really seems true to me, and I shall strive to prove it.

I visited the local Disney Store and picked up a Mickey's Challenge puzzle for
$10.  It's really cute, and the book that it comes with is excellent.  
Included are color photos of Christophe Bandelow, Uwe Meffert, and the puzzle
disassembled into all its parts.  Plus it gives a solution for the puzzle and
has a short bio on Uwe Meffert.  It also shows color photos of the Megaminx,
Pyraminx (not the Tomy version, but a black one), and the 5x5x5 which they
refer to as "Professor's Cube."
Some general notes on Mickey's Challenge.  It is a spherical Skewb, and it
actually turns much more smoothly than my cubical Skewb.  It has the same
delightful "clicking" mechanism that the Skewb and original Pyraminx had.
It is a bit easier than the Skewb, since there are a few blank pieces that
can be exchanged without noticing the difference.  In fact, the book's solution
actually leaves Mickey intact while solving Donald.  After you're bored with
solving it, the concept of making patterns takes on strange dimensions, as you
can make Mickey and Donald exchange body parts and look like Disney on acid!
All in all, it is an excellent little puzzle and I am very glad to see the
Skewb widely available to puzzle enthusiasts everywhere.
One final note:  the booklet gives no credit whatsoever to Tony Durham, who
was credited with the Skewb's invention in Hofstadter's Sci Am articles years
ago.  They instead credit Meffert, since the Skewb's mechanism is based on
the Pyraminx.

Subject:   |G\M| - Some Trivial Partial Results

It occurs to me that a small part of my incorrect attempt during
December to calculate |G\M| can be salvaged.  In particular,
for those cases where B-conjugate classes are of order 1152,
the calculations are trivial.  About 99.9923% of the edge conjugate
classes and about 96.924% of the corner conjugate classes are of
order 1152, so we can calculate the correct number of M-conjugates
of G for a very large percentage of the cases.

Consider some fixed X in GC\B and some fixed Y in GE\B where
|BClass(X)|=1152 and |BClass(Y)|=1152.  Form
BClass(X) * BClass(Y).  Now, |BClass(X) * BClass(Y)| =
|BClass(X)| * |BClass(Y)| / 2 = 1152 * 1152 / 2.
(The division by 2 takes care of parity).  Finally, form
(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M, and we have |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M| =
|BClass(X) * BClass(Y)| / 48 = (1152 * 1152) / 2 / 48 = 13,824.
We know the number of BClasses of GC of order 1152 from computer
search (namely 75,392), and we know the number of BCLasses of GE of
order 1152 from computer search (namely 851,493,140).  Hence, for
the special case of both BClasses being of order 1152, we have the
total number of elements of G\M being 851,493,140 * 75,392 * 13,824 =
887,442,335,689,605,120.

We can derive similar results if only one of BCLass(X) and BClass(Y)
are of order 1152.  For example, there are 4 elements of GE\B
for which |BClass(Y)|=24.  Choose such a Y, and choose X in GC\B
such that |BClass(X)|=1152.  Form BClass(X) * BClass(Y).  It will
be the case that |BClass(X) * BClass(Y)| = 1152 * 24 / 2 = 13,824.
Hence, |(BClass(X) * BClass(Y))\M| = 13,824/48 = 288.  There are 75,392
values of X for which |BClass(X)|=1152, 4 values of Y for which
|BCLass(Y)|=24, and hence there are 75,392 * 4 * 288 = 86,851,584
elements of G\M of the form BClass(X) * BClass(Y) for which
|BCLass(X)| = 1152 and |BClass(Y)| = 24.

There are nineteen cases in all for which at least one of BClass(X)
and BCLass(Y) are of order 1152, and this note calculates only
two of the nineteen.  Completing the other
seventeen would be trivial but tedious.  However, a total solution
to the problem will require coming up with some way to deal with
the cases where neither |BClass(X)|=1152 nor |BClass(Y)|=1152.

A while back I reported on the list of cube books available at the
Library of Congress. At the time, I did not realize the
significance of #2:

2. 85-109601: Mezei, Andras.  Magyar kocka, avagy, Meg mindig ilyen
     gazdagok vagyunk? /  Budapest : Magveto, c1984.  473 p. : ill.
     ; 21 cm.

Digging through some old magazines I reread the cube article in
the March 1986 issue of "Discover" magazine. In this issue
John Tierney talks to Rubik himself. The article itself is
excellent, showing pictures of Rubik's first wooden prototype,
and having discussions on the Golden Age of the Cube when
only Rubik had access to his invention.

I learned that Andras Mezei (a Budapest writer) wrote a book and a
play called "The Hungarian Cube". This chronicles the debacle
that occured when the Hungarians attempted to expand their
operations to meet the huge demand, rather than farm the work
to other factories. Andras writes: "Everyone made money on the
cube except the Hungarians".

Does anyone on Cube-Lovers have this book? Judging by the size
of the book, and the fact that it's illustrated, I think it
would be a worthy addition to any cubist's library, even more
so if there exists an english translation. If not, I feel
encouraged enough to get an English-Hungarian dictionary and
read it anyway!

Some comments on flipping a single pair of edges on the 4x4x4 cube:

Singmaster notation on the 4x4x4 (same notation as Jeffery Adams)
--------------------------------

L left face             l inner left slice
r inner right slice     R right face
F front face            f inner front slice
b inner back slice      B back face
U up face               u inner up slice
d inner down slice      D down face

So L1 would be turn the left face 90 degrees clockwise and l1 would
 be turn the inner left slice 90 degrees clockwise.

I'll use the suffix "2" to be for 180 degree turns and the suffix
 "3" to be for 270 degree turns clockwise or 90 degree turns
 counterclockwise.

This is the shortest sequence I found for flipping 2 adjacent
edges on the 4x4x4 cube (LD pair):

 (r3 D3) ^3 + (r1 D1) ^4 + Rr3 D3 R1 D1 r3 D3 R3 D1 R1 D3

Note the use of Rr to represent both the turns R face & r inner
 slice. Counting slice turns the sequence is 25 turns, or
 24 "hyper moves". This sequence moves some centre pieces around.

However, on checking David Singmaster's Cubic Circular, in issues
 5 & 6, Autumn & Winter 1982 there is a shorter process on
 page 15, (UB pair):

 r2 D2 l3 D1 R3 U1 R3 U3 l3 U1 R1 U3 l1 R1 D1 r2

This process, although more difficult to memorize, is only 16 slice
 moves. It also disturbs centre pieces, although in a simpler way.
 I always solve the centre pieces last on the 4x4x4.

Hope this helps!

Thank you. But what is the shortest way to flip 2 adj. edges without 
messing the center pieces? I can't find shorter than 49 turns.

I visited the local Disney Store and picked up a Mickey's Challenge puzzle for

$10.  It's really cute, and the book that it comes with is excellent.

Included are color photos of Christophe Bandelow, Uwe Meffert, and the puzzle

disassembled into all its parts.  Plus it gives a solution for the puzzle and

has a short bio on Uwe Meffert.  It also shows color photos of the Megaminx,

Pyraminx (not the Tomy version, but a black one), and the 5x5x5 which they

refer to as "Professor's Cube."

Some general notes on Mickey's Challenge.  It is a spherical Skewb, and it

actually turns much more smoothly than my cubical Skewb.  It has the same

delightful "clicking" mechanism that the Skewb and original Pyraminx had.

It is a bit easier than the Skewb, since there are a few blank pieces that

can be exchanged without noticing the difference.  In fact, the book's solution

actually leaves Mickey intact while solving Donald.  After you're bored with

solving it, the concept of making patterns takes on strange dimensions, as you

can make Mickey and Donald exchange body parts and look like Disney on acid!

All in all, it is an excellent little puzzle and I am very glad to see the

Skewb widely available to puzzle enthusiasts everywhere.

One final note:  the booklet gives no credit whatsoever to Tony Durham, who

was credited with the Skewb's invention in Hofstadter's Sci Am articles years

ago.  They instead credit Meffert, since the Skewb's mechanism is based on

the Pyraminx.

Subject: 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.

I've been getting a lot of requests for 4x4x4 cubes, and we're looking into
getting them.  However, I have a couple questions.

1) Why are 4x4x4 cubes so interesting?  Do the additional symmetries make for
   interesting questions, are they more fun, or easier to solve?

2) It appears to me that if you know how to solve the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube,
   then you can easily solve the 5x5x5 rubiks (i.e., the solution is
   derivative).  For example, you can treat the inner 3x3 faces of the 5x5x5
   as a single 3x3x3 cube.  Alternately, you can treat the edges/faces along
   with the the middle three slices combined into a single slice as its own
   3x3x3 cube, and this would not really disturb the "inner face" 3x3x3 cube.
   Is this really so, or am I missing something? Is the 5x5x5 cube simply
   the group product of two 3x3x3 cubes and one or two sub-groups of a 3x3x3,
   or is it more complex than that?  How does this relate to the 4x4x4?

I do have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and am familiar with abstract
algebra.  I appreciate any light you can shed on these questions.  I would
like to be able to converse intelligently about the cubes; that is why I
subscribed to this list.

I'd (probably) buy one - I don't know what's become of the one I had.
Depends on price, of course, but I found the 5-Cube price acceptable.

I doubt it.  If one ignores the center slice in each dimension on a
5x5x5, one has a 4x4x4.  I think it's the completist instinct any
collector has. :-)

Now what I'd *really* like is something topologically equivalent to a
2x2x2x2 Cube.  Obviously a 2x2x2x2 Cube can't really be built, but it
should be possible to build something topologically equivalent.  (A
3x3x3x3 would be nice too, but perhaps too difficult.)  The hard part
is designing an emulation that has some aesthetic appeal; it's easy
enough to write a program that lets you permute appropriate overlapping
4-cycles of objects without any intuitively-obvious structure.

No, not really.  If you can do the 3-Cube *and the 4-Cube*, then the
5-Cube has no new challenges to offer (nor, I believe, does any size).

But the 4-Cube and 5-Cube do have challenges the 3-Cube doesn't, namely
edge cubies and face-center cubies.  All the 3-Cube experience in the
world won't help you if you get your 5-Cube solved except for two edge
cubies which are swapped.  (Or rather, general Cube-type-puzzle
experience will help - for example, how to use conjugates - but
3-Cube-specific experience won't.)

You're missing something, but not much. :-)  As you say, there are two
ways of emulating a 3-Cube on the 5-Cube, namely to paste slices 2-1-2
along each dimension and to paste them 1-3-1.  (I hope that's not too
abbreviated to be comprehensible - I mean, along each dimension, paste
the 5-Cube slices together into three groups, taking two, then one,
then two slices, or one, three, and one.)  However, it is entirely
possible to scramble the 5-Cube in ways that cannot be solved by
treating the 5-Cube as virtual 3-Cubes, except in the trivial sense
that any 5-Cube turn can be viewed as one or more turns of
appropriately-chosen virtual 3-Cubes.

For example, I can swap two edge cubies (and also permute center cubies
in invisible ways); alternatively, I can permute the face cubies so
that the 2-1-2 virtual 3-Cube has two identical corner v-cubies.

A well lubed 4x4x4 cube is still relatively easy to physically
manipulate. As der Mouse suggests, it is arguably the largest
interesting cube from a solver's point of view. Once one starts
actually twisting with a 5x5x5 cube, the physical problems
become more severe, e.g. the stickers come off easier,
turning the slice you want to is more of a challenge, etc.

In the virtual realm of computer cubing the patterns you can
create are more elaborate, although I find in practice that
finding pretty patterns on the 5x5x5 can become wearisome
due to fact there are 9 centre pieces per side!

Using the 4x4x4 cube we can produce a single exchange of centres
and an exchange of edge pairs, and we can invert a single edge pair.
Thus we can construct all the impossible 3x3x3 patterns except those
involving a twist of a single corner! That is why I think the 4x4x4
cube is a good cube to have. The individual centre cubies can
naturally wander all over the cube, and on the 3x3x3 cube they are
fixed.

In the case of the 5x5x5 cube, lots of the 3x3x3 knowledge does
help. When dealing with the 5x5x5's middlemost slice (let's call
one such slice "fm" for middlemost front slice) some of the
3x3x3 move sequences will move the appropriate edges, but now
these sequences will also move centre pieces, specifically the
ones which have no counterpart on the 3^3 and 4^3.

To solve cubes 4x4x4 and greater requires new sequences to
efficiently move centre cubies at will, and in the case of
the 5^3 there really is no standard language to interchange
move sequences and label individual cubies.

I find having a letter as a mnemonic helps, so I'll suggest the
following as an extension of Singmaster's 4x4x4 notation
for the 5x5x5 cube:


L left face          l inner left slice    lm left middlemost slice
R right face         r inner right slice   rm right middlemost slice
F front face         f inner front slice   fm front middlemost slice
B back face          b inner back slice    bm back middlemost slice
U up face            u inner up slice      um up middlemost slice
D down face          d inner down slice    dm down middlemost slice

Again, we follow the alphabetic component by a number to
signify the rotation (1 = 90, 2 = 180, 3 = 270 or -90)

This is overkill, and we can dispense with rm, bm and dm.

Thus we could flip 2 middlemost edges at FD and BD with:

(fm1 D1) ^3 + fm1 D2 + (fm1 D1) ^3 + fm1   (disturbs some centres)

followed by:

(fm2 + u2) ^2 + (fm2 + lm2) ^2    (corrects the centres)

I believe this is correct, and I will double-check on my physical
5x5x5 at home. Definitely 5^3 cubing is a sport for the
specialist ;->

This is interesting, because it's almost exactly the opposite of my
experience.

The problem seems to be the difference between the internal mechanisms of
the odd- and even- ordered cubes.  The 3X and 5X have that "fixed" center
piece attached to the core whereas the center face cubelets of the 4X are
held together "under tension".  My experience has been that this adjustment
is critical, but often out of whack.  As a consequence, of the four 4X's
I've owned, only one was really useable; two were so stiff they were very
difficult to turn (even with lubrication) and one was so loose that it
never lasted more than about 20 minutes before dissolving into a pile of
cubelets (it currently lives in a sack in my office drawer).  These were
all real "brand-named" cubes, not cheap twiz-o knock-offs.

On the other hand all of the 5X's I've owned have been _very_ easy to turn
without any special customization.  Except for the tendency (as Mark
mentions) for the stickers to come off of one of them, they're consistently
more comfortable to the hand than any of the 3X's I've owned.

Probably true; it's the largest cube that actually offers new
challenges.  However, bigger cubes are better in that they offer more
variety for making pretty patterns. :-)

This brings up an interesting point.  Perhaps it would be possible to
build a 4-Cube that was internally a 5-Cube but for which the middle
slice was not actually visible on the surface?  Or a 2-Cube that's
internally a 3-Cube?  I wonder if it might make for smoother-turning
cubes.

I have owned only one 4-Cube, and it's been long enough since I knew
where it was that I don't recall how easy it was to turn.  I now have
two 3-Cubes and a 5-Cube.  One of the 3-Cubes is a joy to turn; it's
lubed enough that it turns readily and easily, even when the turn has a
good deal of skew to correct, but it's not so loose that it turns when
I don't want it to.  (The other 3-Cube is (a) missing one center cubie
face and (b) much more difficult to turn.)  The 5-Cube (one of the
recent Ishi Press cubes, btw) is mechanically quite good, though the
orange stickers did tend to come off (no other color did, and contact
cement worked just fine for putting them back on).  Not as good as my
good 3-Cube, though.

I've wondered whether it would be possible to build higher-order cubes.
The corners of the 5-Cube still catch by a respectable amount as the
face turns, but by little enough that it makes me wonder if the 6-Cube
or 7-Cube is actually feasible.  (Oh, for a really good
force-reflecting dataglove...then such a thing could be done virtually
with no problem at all!)

Subject:   Number of M-Conjugate Classes for GC\M

On 4 December 1993, I posted results from a breadth-first exhaustive
search of GC\M, the corners of the 3x3x3, reduced by M-conjugation.
The posting included a summary of how many conjugate classes there
were at each level of the search tree (i.e., distance from Start).

It occurred to me that I had not also posted a summary of M-conjugates
for the corners of the 3x3x3 by the size of the conjugate classes.  I
searched my records, only to discover that I had never calculated
such sizes.  If I had, I probably would have been forced to analyze
properly the distinction between M-conjugation and B-conjugation,
because B-conjugation makes no sense for the corners of the 3x3x3.
B-conjugation *can* be performed for the corners of the 3x3x3, but you
end up with the 2x2x2 instead because B-conjugation effectively
removes the centers.

Anyway, I have now calculated M-conjugate class sizes for GC\M via
computer search, and here are the results.

                   M-Class     Number
                     Size        of
                              Classes

                         3        3
                         4        1
                         6       34
                         8       33
                        12      301
                        16      104
                        24     9064
                        48  1832428

                     Total  1841970

Notice that with M-conjugation, the maximum class is size is 48,
rather than 1152 as it is with B-conjugation.  Hence, my posting
of 4 December 1993 incorrectly identified the results as being
for "1152 fold symmetry".  The results are correct, but they
should be labeled as being for "48 fold symmetry", i.e., for
M-conjugation rather than for B-conjugation.

In calculating M-conjugate class sizes for GC\M, I did not "start
from scratch".  Rather, I used the existing results for B-conjugate
classes as a base.  In the case of B-conjugate classes of order
1152, no calculations are required.  Each such B-class can simply
be partitioned into 24 M-classes of order 48.  Hence, I had to
perform calculations for less than 4% of the B-classes.  Here is
a summary matrix, showing for each B-class size the number of
each M-class size which are derived.

The first row of the matrix exemplifies the process of calculating
M-Class sizes from B-Class sizes.  In the case of corners, there
is only one B-class of order 24, namely Start.  The 24 elements of
the B-class are the 24 elements of the form Ic, where c is in C,
the 24 rotations of the cube.  Under B-conjugation, these 24
elements are equivalent  (i.e., in a centerless cube such as the
2x2x2, the 24 rotations of I are indistinguishable).  But in a cube
with centers, such as the corners of the 3x3x3, the 24 elements
are not equivalent.

For example, the M-class of order 1 is {I}.  One of the M-classes
of order 6 is {FB', UD', RL', LR', BF', DU'}.  The M-class of order 3
is {FFB'B', RRL'L', UUD'D'}.  That's as many as I can do in my head,
but I think the pattern is clear.

M-classes are a partition of the B-classes.
In the case of B-classes of order 1152, the partition is regular  --
i.e., you get exactly 24 M-classes of order 48.  However, all
partitions are not regular.  In the partition of the B-class of I
which we just discussed, there is 1 M-class of order 1, 1 M-class
of order 3, 2 M-classes of order 6, and 1 M-class of order 8, for
a total of 24 M-classes.  Many other partitions are not regular,
as well.

Yes, I think you could build such a 4-Cube. Likewise, you could build a
2-Cube as a 3-Cube with invisible middle slices. But I don't believe you'd
want one: it could get completely jammed much too easily.

The reason: If you take a 3-Cube and rotate its left and right slices 45
degrees each, you cannot rotate any of its other faces. This isn't
surprising, since you don't expect to be able to perform one rotation
halfway through another. If its middle slices were hidden, however, it would
*appear* to be a 2-Cube which is not halfway through a rotation, and the
fact that you couldn't move any faces but the left and right ones would be
surprising - and undesirable.

Unfortunately, I believe such a situation could probably arise quite easily.
If you were to take the 2-Cube concerned and rotate its right face 90
degrees relative to its left face, you're going to be OK if the hidden
middle layer rotates 0 or 90 degrees relative to the left face, but not OK
if it rotates any other amount. I suspect most mechanisms would be more
liable to rotate it an intermediate amount!

There may be a way out, though. If you can anchor the place where the three
axes meet to one of the corner cubelets in some way, the problem is solved:
if the "anchor cubelet" is in the left face, then the hidden layer will
rotate 0 decrees; if it is in the right face, then 90 degrees.

Duh, yeah; that never occurred to me.

Yes.  I think this may be possible, too...consider a normal 3-Cube, and
restrict yourself to R, U, and F turns.  Then ignore the center and
edge cubies - the ones that get invisibilized.  You're left with a
2-Cube.  Three edge cubies never move with respect to the center cubies
or the corner cubie they surround; glue those together.  Presto!

The same treatment is not possible for making a 4-Cube out of a 5-Cube,
but an alternative occurs to me, that I *think* will work for higher
cubes: key three of the (invisible) center cubies to the center
six-pronged piece, so that they can't turn.  Then half the face turns
will cause the invisible center slice to turn with them; non-face
slices (which don't exist on the 2/3-Cube) work normally.

I notice with this construction for (say) a 4-Cube, the puzzle core
turns whenever certain face slices do.  With the 4-Cube I owned (and
presumably still own, if I could find it), the puzzle core turns
whenever certain next-to-center slices do.  I suspect the latter would
make for a smoother-turning puzzle.  Perhaps someone will someday build
a 5-Cube-turned-4-Cube and this can be determined.

In the (IMO unlikely) event I originated any of the above ideas, I
hereby place it/them in the public domain.  Go wild, Ishi Press. :-)

Subject: Re: Some Proposed Terminology

I welcome Jerry Bryan's <BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> efforts to
improve the terminology of the groups associated with Rubik's cube.
But there is some additional clarification I think is necessary.

> Let G be the standard cube group for the 3x3x3 cube....
> Let GC be the corners with centers without edges group....
> Let GE be the edges with centers without corners group....

That much will do, mod quibbles about what name is best.

> Let G\C be the corners with edges without centers group.  I intend
> for the notation to indicate G reduced by C, where C is the rotation

> Let GC\C be the corners without edges without centers group....
> Let GE\C be the edges without corners without centers group....

First, these are not, strictly speaking, groups.  Well, you can make
them groups, by defining what the group operation is.  But I don't
know any way of doing that without losing the symmetrical nature of
the problem.

Second, I would suggest that G/C, GC/C, and GE/C are more standard
names for these objects.  The elements are nominally 24-element sets,
each of which is an equivalence class when two positions are
considered equivalent when they differ by their position with respect
to the corners.  The classes are called the cosets of C in G, GC, and
GE, respectively.

> Let G\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for G.....
> Let GC\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for GC....
> Let GE\M be the set of M-conjugate classes for GE....

The partition of a group into conjugacy classes is not at all the same
as the partition into cosets.  So I would prefer to use different
symbology, like "\" for conjugacy and "/" for cosets, but....

> Recall that B is the function which calculates the canonical form

> Let G\B be the set of B-classes for G [ and likewise for GE, GC ].

Well, if you are using "\" for a generic partition into equivalence
classes, then we should really do something like G\Conj(M) for
partitions into conjugacy classes.  At least then you can say
G/C=G\Cosets(C).

> Then, we have Gx\B=(Gx\C)\M=(Gx\M)\C.  In English, we can decompose
> B into a multiplication by C and M (in either order).

No, that's _multiplication_ by C and _conjugation_ by M.  A good
example of why it's important not to use confusing symbols.  M and C
are not at all treated the same, except inasmuch as they are used to
induce partitions into equivalence classes.  Say instead that
            Gx\B = (Gx/C)\Conj(M) = (Gx\Conj(M))/C.

Well, the part about moving only seven (corner) cubies is the approach
that's been taken before on this list to deal with cubes that don't
have face centers.  It has the advantage that the object being treated
is a group.  But the problem is that the group is no longer cubically
symmetrical (in some vague sense).  This led me, at least, to lose
track of the structure that would allow analysis of M-conjugacy.  So I
have to admire your tackling GE as a whole, instead of trying to stick
to GE/C.  At first blush, it looks like GE/C is 24 times smaller.  But
since GE/C\Conj(M) is almost 48 times smaller still, it's important to
work in GE at least enough to be able to use the conjugation.  Which
is beside the point that I'm actually very interested in the structure
of Gx/Conj(M) itself.  And that is what I was really getting at in
1984 when I asked about how many positions there really are.

Subject: Concerning B, CSymm, and Symm

In his message of Sat, 8 Jan 1994 08:46:20 EST, Jerry Bryan
<BRYAN%WVNVM.BITNET@mitvma.mit.edu> considers his use of the term "B"
``to indicate various aspects of the conjugacy class generated by
m'Xmc.''

I don't think that's properly called a conjugacy class, but a
different sort of equivalence class.  A conjugacy class is a special
kind of equivalence class (just as a coset is a special kind of
equivalence class) but this B is a little bit of both, so I don't
think it is correct to call it either.

> Let X be any cube.  Then the set of B-conjugacy classes of X is
> the set of all m'Xmc for all m in M and all c in C.  We denote
> this set as BClass(X).  B is the function B(X)=min(BClass(X)).

That's a little unfortunate--I'd prefer to use B(X) for the
equivalence class, and min(B(X))--or repr(B(X))--for the canonical
representative.  That's because the representative is not the
important thing here, it's just a convenient way to represent (!) the
class in a computer.

> Note that we could have defined BClass(X) equivalently as the set of
> all mXm'c, or as the set of all cm'Xm, or as the set of all
> cmXm'.... This is the justification for the assertion in a previous

Not quite.  The justification for (Gx\Conj(M))/C = (Gx/C)\Conj(M)
is that instead of m'Xmc we could choose m'Xcm, a possibility you
didn't list.

In his message of "Sat, 8 Jan 1994 10:52:22 EST", Jerry continues with
discussion on combining conjugacy classes.  We've exchanged some
private email on the subject material, but in case anyone on the list
is following this stuff....

> There are only 10 distinct values for |BClass(X)| and for
> |BClass(Y)|, namely 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, 288, 384, 576, and
> 1152.  (By the way, I have never figured out why it is *exactly* the
> same set of values for both the corners and for the edges.  It is
> easy to see why it is approximately the same set of values....

I'm not sure what kind of approximation you mean, but certainly those
ten values are all that are possible:

    Proof: For if m1,m2 are in the same coset of M/CSymm(X), then
    (m1 m2') is in CSymm(X), so X' (m1 m2')' X (m1 m2') = c0 in C so
    m1' X m1 = m2' X c0 m2.  It's then clear that
         { m1' X m1 c : c in C } =  { m2' X m2 c : c in C }      (*)
    are equal 24-element sets.  The same manipulation in reverse shows
    that if (*) holds for some m1,m2 in M, then m1 and m2 are in the
    same coset of M/CSymm(X).  So |BClass(X)|=24 |M/CSymm(X)|.
    |M/CSymm(X)| must be a divisor of |M|=48, QED.

It wouldn't have been all that surprising to see one of the possible
sizes of |CSymm(X)| fail to appear as a symmetry group of the corners
or edges, but it's not surprising that they all do, either.

> [For the original approach] I needed to be able to prove that for a
> fixed m and n, that |(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n]| had the same

That is to say, that the sizes |CSymm(X)| and |CSymm(Y)| might
determine {|Symm(X*Y)|} for X in GC\B, Y in GE\B, and so (X*Y) in
G\Conj(M).  It doesn't, but the situation is even worse.  Jerry goes
on to suppose that perhaps CSymm(X) and CSymm(Y) themselves might
determine {|Symm(X*Y)|}, and even that isn't true.  I've discovered
this by a computer search of GC\B. (A search of GE\B is in progress,
but for the current result we can take Y=I in GE\B).  I have found
that AllSymms(X) is not determined, even up to subgroup sizes, by
CSymm(X).

According to the search, the following are the only positions of GC\B
for which |CSymm(X)|=16.

          X1                       X2                       X3

        +---+                    +---+                    +---+

Coincidentally, I have been (privately) calling the CSymm(Xi)
subgroups the "X subgroups" of M, an X subgroup being the subgroup
that maps an orthogonal axis of the cube (in the above examples, the
L-R axis) to itself.  X1 is a notable position, in that each corner
has been swapped with its opposite corner.  Symm(X1) is an X subgroup
as well, and there is another X subgroup in AllSymms(X1).  There is,
however, no 16-element subgroup in AllSymms(X2) or AllSymms(X3).  (We
have seen X2 before: it is the corners of the Laughter (or 4/)
position).  In fact, my program says that

     AllSymms(X1) contains two occurrences of 16-element X subgroups,
                           two occurrences of the 8-element HX subgroup,
                           two occurrences of 8-element R subgroups,
                           two occurrences of 8-element S subgroups,
                           eight occurrences of 4-element HS subgroups, and
                           eight occurrences of the 2-element HV subgroup.
                                     
     AllSymms(X2) and AllSymms(X3) each contain
                           two occurrences of 8-element CX subgroups,
                           two occurrences of 8-element AX subgroups,
                           two occurrences of 8-element P subgroups,
                           two occurrences of 8-element Q subgroups,
                           eight occurrences of 2-element ES subgroups, and
                           eight occurrences of 2-element HW subgroups.

The names of these groups are part of a taxonomy of the subgroups of M
I've developed, which I won't go into just now.  But the point that I
find surprising here is that AllSymms(X1) and AllSymms(X2) are
completely disjoint.  While that can't happen all the time (smaller
CSymm() groups have many occurrences of the one-element "I" subgroup)
I think the tendency to disjointness is too pronounced to be simple
anti-coincidence.

Subject: Computer & Health

The Computer User Family (CUF) is concerned about the health problem
associated with computers.  Video Display Terminals, emit UV and ELF
radiation and may cause cancer, immune system irregularities, miscarriages
and eye fatigue.
Computer noise from fans, disk and CD drives is also becoming a source of
anxiety, stress and general discomfort .  We usually don't realize how loud
our computers are: 50dB and more. 
These problems should be dealt with and add-ons should be provided for
present computers to avoid putting us at risks.  Some safe screens and quiet
power supplies are coming out but they are marginal and prices are
prohibitive.
Meanwhile the general guidelines for the users are:
1. Position yourself approximately 22 inches to 28 inches (arm's length) from
the screen and four feet from the sides and rear of other terminals. 
2. Eliminate sources of glare and lower light levels in the room.  Don't sit
facing a bright window. If necessary, use screen hoods, glare shields over
the screen or wear anti-UV/anti-glare glasses. 
3. Put a noise absorbing mat under your computer.  Pull your computer away
from the wall or any hard surface that reflects noise and vibration back to
you.
4. Rest occasionally during periods of intense concentration.  Closing your
eyes helps.
5. Turn off the VDT when not in use.

Dan Hoey's criticism's are quite valid.  I will attempt to repair
the damage as follows:  1) accept the Gx/C notation in lieu
of Gx\C,  2) define an operation within Gx/C such that
Gx/C is a group, and 3) use Gx/C as a model for cubes without
centers in such a way that the symmetrical nature of the problem
is retained.

Let C be the set of twenty-four whole cube rotations of the cube, and
let G be the standard 3x3x3 cube group.  We observe that if X is a cube
in G, then c'Xc is also a cube in G for every c in C.  We could call
this operation C-conjugancy.  However, there is seldom (if ever) any
reason to speak of C-conjugancy.  That is, C is just a subset of M,
the set of forty-eight whole cube rotations and reflections.  Indeed,
C is half of M, and the other half of M is the reflection of C.  Hence,
M-conjugancy of the form m'Xm is more powerful than C-conjugancy, and
there is normally no reason to speak of C-conjugancy.  I only bring it
up to emphasize that if X is in G, then c'Xc is in G.

On the other hand, if I understand correctly the model most people use
for G, elements of the form Xc or cX are not in G except for the
trivial case where c=I.  The problem is that C is considered to move
the centers, but G is generated by Q, the set of quarter-turns of the
faces, and Q does not move the centers.  For example, there is a
c in C such that F=c'Rc, but there is not a c in C such that
F=Rc or F=cR.  And indeed, neither Rc nor cR are in G at all unless
c=I.

As we said, G is generated as G=<Q>, where Q is the set of
quarter-turns Q={F,B,U,D,L,R,F',B',U',D',L',R'}.  Elements of Q
move the corners and edges, but Q is the identity on the centers.
C, on the other hand, is generally considered to move the centers.
Hence, the group generated as <Q,C> is a supergroup of G, and there
are elements of the supergroup which are not in G.  (This
supergroup, by the way, is not The Supergroup.  The Supergroup is
generated by Q alone, but with orientations of the (otherwise fixed)
centers considered.)  Therefore, our first order of business is to
make C into a sub-group of G.

We observe that since the elements of Q are the identity on the
centers, the primary function of the centers is to provide a
frame of reference.  But we can provide a frame of reference
without the centers actually being there.

For example, consider the group GC consisting of cube centers
and corners.  You can model this group by removing the edge
labels from a physical cube.  Establish the cube at Start and
perform RL'.  The corners will be rotated forward, and will be
positioned properly with respect to each other, but the cube is
clearly not solved.  You can tell that the cube is not at Start
because the corners are not aligned properly with the centers.

Now, do the same thing except remove both the edge and center
labels.  If you perform RL' at Start, the cube "looks"
solved but rotated forward.  However, we can adopt the convention
that the cube is solved only if the Up color is Up, the Front
color is Front, etc.  With this convention in place, RL' is
clearly seen not to be solved; it is two moves from Start.
The convention provides the fixed frame of reference.
Furthermore, RL' (which is in GC) is equal to an element of C, and
indeed all elements of C are in GC, as are all elements of the
form Xc or cX for c in C and X in GC.  Hence, we have <Q>=<Q,C>.

Similar comments apply to GE, the group of edges and centers, except
that processes composed from elements of Q to accomplish rotations
in C are not quite so short in GE as they are in GC.

G, the full 3x3x3 cube group consisting of corners, edges, and centers
is a bit more difficult.  The problem is that if X is in G, then
objects of the form Xc or cX are in G only if c is even.  Twelve
elements of C are even and twelve are odd.  Indeed, C[even] is
a sub-group of C, but C[odd] is not.

We will deal with this situation (as circumstances require) in two
different ways.  One is simply to restrict ourselves to C[even]
when dealing with G.  The other is to define a new group we will
call GS.  In our model for G in which the centers are implied by
a frame of reference convention rather than by actual physical
centers, we can easily add slice moves to the standard face moves.
If the centers were physically present, then the slice moves would
move the centers, but without the physical centers there is
no problem.

If S is the set of slice moves, then GS is generated as <Q,S>.
GS is essentially G with parity restrictions removed.  Hence we
observe that |G|=|GC|*|GE|/2, |GS|=|GC|*|GE|, and |GS|=|G|*2.
Also, if X is in G or in GS, then elements of the form cX or
Xc are in GS for all c in C.  In those occasions where we are
willing to think of GS rather than G, we can use C rather than
C[even].

At this point, we can say that GS/C, G/C[even], GC/C, and GE/C are
cosets of C in GS, C[even] in G, C in GC, and C in GE, respectively.
To be a little more conformant with standard coset notation, we will
write cube elements as lower case letters for the remainder of this
note, and hence for a particular cube x a coset of C is denoted as
Cx={y: y=cx} or xC={y: y=xc}.

Now, we propose a group operator for the cosets:  Cx Cy = C(xy) and
xC yC = (xy)C.  Showing that we have a group is easy.  I originally
included a proof in this note, but there is a proof in Chapter 8 of
Frey and Singmaster's _Handbook of Cubik Math_.  Hence, I will defer
to their proof instead.

According to Frey and Singmaster, G/C is called the factor group of
C in G, or the quotient group of G by C.  Of most significance to
us right now is the fact that the identity of the factor group is
Ci or iC, where i is the identity of G.  But Ci or iC is just C.
Hence, the identity of the factor group is C.  This justifies our
identification of G/C with a centerless cube.  In English, it means
that we can rotate a centerless cube in space without changing
anything.  I think this would comply with most people's intuitive
sense of what it means for a cube to be centerless.

Finally, as to whether this model retains the "symmetrical nature of
the problem", I will have to leave that as an open question,
depending on precisely what we mean by "symmetrical".  It seems to
me that this model does a better job of being "symmetrical" than
a model which includes only seven corner cubies or only eleven
edge cubies, but maybe not.  What does "symmetrical" mean when
it comes to centerless cubes?

I recently picked up this puzzle on a trip to Houston, TX.
It is really sad that even though this puzzle is made in China by a Hong
Kong company, I had to go to the US to get it! It is not available for
sale here in Hong Kong.
Many thanks for your tip. If any one knows about any other interesting
puzzles, they are welcome to contribute!

Cheers!

Subject: Re:  10x10 Tangle

Sorry about not reporting this earlier, but my search for solutions for
Rubiks Tangle 10x10 confirms the finding of Don Woods: no solutions!

I am beginning to get real curious about that 'easy argument'.
Does this argument depend on the particular choice for the four
duplicated pieces or not?
If it does, there could exist a choice that does allow a solution, and
we could re-define the puzzle as follows:
  find which four pieces to duplicate in order to find solutions for
  the 10x10.
If the number of solutions varies depending on the choice, you could
even add a restriction:
  find which four pieces to duplicate in order to find a set which has
  the minimum number of solutions for the 10x10.

But if the easy argument does NOT depend on the choice, i.e.: any
choice would lead to no solutions, then the above puzzles would be
senseless as well.

So if anyone at all knows this argument, please tell us and solve the
mystery.
