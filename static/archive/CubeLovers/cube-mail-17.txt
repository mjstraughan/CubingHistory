Subject:   A Proposal for a More General Definition of Symmetry

Our normal definition of symmetry for Rubik's cube is based
ultimately on the 48 symmetries of the standard math book
wire model of a cube, and the 48 symmetries were discovered
long before Rubik's cube was ever dreamed of.  This note is
based on the conviction that these 48 symmetries do not really
capture all that we might think of as "symmetry" when we think
of Rubik's cube.  This note has the further purpose to propose
a more general definition of symmetry for Rubik's cube.

I want to start with a couple of really basic concepts.  I think
every reader of this list knows what a permutation is, namely
it is a one-to-one onto function on a set.  In the case of a finite
set as we have with Rubik, a function on a set is one-to-one
if and only if it onto, so we can sometimes get by with speaking
only of one-to-one or by speaking only of onto.

But what is a symmetry?  A very standard definition is something
like "the set of all rigid motions that transform a given geometric
figure onto itself" (James and James Mathematics Dictionary).
Another way to say it is that the transformation preserves the
figure.

Working with that definition, a symmetry almost inevitably may
be interpreted as a permutation.  With simple geometric figures,
the permutation would usually be described as being a permutation on
Euclidean n-space  --  2-space for a square or circle, etc., and
3-space for a cube or sphere, etc.  Hence, we might think of
a symmetry as being a special kind of permutation, namely one that
preserves a geometric figure in Euclidean n-space.

I have had a difficult time finding books that address the issue
of symmetry vs. permutation to my satisfaction.  It is very hard
to think of a symmetry abstractly enough that it doesn't simply
turn into a permutation right before your eyes.

Paul Yale's "Geometry and Symmetry" doesn't really seem to define
a symmetry (it sort of assumes you know what one is), but it does
describe the relationship between a symmetry and a permutation.
I would paraphrase as follows.  Label your geometric figure in
some fashion  --  e.g., label the edges, label the axes, label
the vertices, or label *something*.  Then, there is a homomorphism
between the set of symmetries and the corresponding set of
permutations on the labels.

But I repeat that it is hard for me to conceive of the set of symmetries
in a sufficiently abstract fashion that the symmetries themselves
aren't already permutations on *some* set or other.  So it seems to me
that Yale could just as well be talking about homomorphisms between
one set of permutations and another set of permutations as talking
about homomorphisms between symmetries and permutations.

A couple of quick additional points, and then I will go on:
1) since we are talking about homomorphisms, it is obvious that
both the set of symmetries and the set of permutations to which
they map are groups, and 2) most homomorphisms between symmetries
and permutations turn out in fact to be isomorphisms.  This latter
observation gives added weight to the notion that symmetries are
just a special kind of permutation.

Given all that has been said so far, we could informally say that
the normal definition of a symmetry is that it is a permutation
that preserves a geometric figure.  Our more general definition
will simply be that a symmetry is a permutation that preserves
some property.  If we were sufficiently liberal in our notion of
"preserving some property", then most any permutation could be
interpreted as a symmetry.  We will not be quite that liberal
by the time we are done, but we will be more liberal than
would be permitted by the standard 48 math book symmetries of
the cube.

But what property of Rubik's cube should we try to preserve if we
want a more general definition of symmetry than the normal one?
I wish to motivate our definition of that property in several
steps.

The standard Rubik's cube definition of symmetry for a position X is
Symm(X) is the set of all m in M such that X=m'Xm, or equivalently
such that mX=Xm.  M is the set of 48 permutations on the Rubik's
cube corresponding to the 48 symmetries of a cube.

Write a position Z as Z=XY, where X is the permutation on the
corners and Y is the permutation on the edges.  We have
Symm(Z)=Symm(XY)=Symm(X) intersect Symm(Y).  For example, we
could have Symm(X)=M, Symm(Y)=I, and Symm(Z)=Symm(XY)=I.
Such a position would look very "symmetrical" because the
corners would be fixed (or "solved"), although the edges
would be scrambled.  Most people would consider such a position
to be more "symmetrical" than one where both the corners and
edges were scrambled, although we would have Symm(Z)=I
in either case.

A couple of points before proceeding:  1)  From an information
theory point of view, Symm(X) and Symm(Y) separately contain
more information than does Symm(XY).  There is an obvious
loss of information when we calculate Symm(X) intersect Symm(Y).
This is a strong indication that Symm(XY) does not tell us
everything we might like to know about the symmetry of a position.
2) The set of positions Z=XY for which Symm(X)=M forms a group
(as does the set of positions for which Symm(Y)=M).  This anticipates
where we are headed, namely that group membership is the property
that we should seek to preserve in a more general definition of
symmetry.

A third (and equivalent) definition for Symm(X) is that Symm(X) is
the set of all m in M such that X'm'Xm=I.  Most readers will
recognize X'm'Xm as a commutator.  Per Dan Hoey, we can generalize
and define CSymm(X) to be the set of all m in M such that X'm'Xm
is in C, the set of 24 rotations of the cube.  For example, if
we have Z=XY as before, then CSymm(X)=M means that the corners
are positioned properly with respect to each other, although they
might be rotated with respect to the fixed face centers.
Such a position would look fairly "symmetrical", even to a
non-cubemeister, even though we might have Symm(Z)=I.

Again, we have the set of all positions for which CSymm(X)=M
forms a group.  Similarly, the set of all positions for which
CSymm(Y)=M forms a group, and the set of all positions
for which CSymm(Z)=CSymm(XY)=M forms a group.

Recall that there are 98 subgroups of M.  For each subgroup K of
M, there is a corresponding subgroup of G consisting of all the
K-symmetric positions.  So would could just as well define
symmetry in terms of these 98 subgroups of G.  But there are far
more than 98 subgroups of G.  (We don't know how many, and I
doubt than even GAP could tell us).  Why not simply define
symmetry in G in terms of subgroup membership in G?  The symmetry
of a position X is then the set of all subgroups of H of G
for which X is in H.  And a symmetry operation (in the sense
that a symmetry is a permutation that preserves something) is
an operation that preserves subgroup membership.

That pretty much completes my proposal, but I have a few closing
remarks.

    1) The proposed general definition of symmetry is
       analogous to the Thistlethwaite algorithm for solving
       the cube.  Typical cube solutions gradually solve more
       and more of the cube.  The "more and more of the cube"
       that gets solved can be characterized as a sequence of
       nested subgroups.  Thistlethwaite reversed the process
       and created a sequence of nested subgroups
       which in turn solves more and more of the cube.  Similarly,
       the standard definition of symmetry implies a set of 98
       subgroups of G.  We reverse the process and let all the
       subgroups of G define symmetry instead.

    2) The proposed general definition of symmetry has the
       virtue that it includes the standard definition as a
       special case, since the 98 K-symmetric subgroups of
       G are in fact subgroups of G.

    3) The proposed general definition of symmetry has the
       virtue that there is only one position that is
       "completely symmetric", namely Start itself (the
       identity permutation).  The standard definition of
       symmetry has four positions which are "completely
       symmetric", which to me is an unsatisfactory state
       of affairs.

       (Recall that we have Symm(X)=M for Start, Pons Asinorum,
       Superflip, and the composition of Pons and Superflip.
       I am still bummed out that this is the case while at the
       same time only Start and Superflip are in the center of
       G.  This suggests that Superflip is "more symmetric"
       than Pons.  I wonder if such a suggestion would be
       supported by my proposed general definition of symmetry?)

 Very little literature exists on Alexander's Star. Ideal Toy published
a solution booklet, and Adam Alexander (the puzzle's inventor) wrote
a book, and David Singmaster wrote his analysis in one of his
Cubic Circulars. Dr. Singmaster also mentions Alexander's Star in
Rubik's Cubik Compendium in a chapter about variations on Rubik's
cube.

 The Ideal booklet mentions that Alexander's Star has 24 start
positions, and Dr. Singmaster states there are 12 start positions,
each one with it's own mirror reflection, again giving 24 start
positions in total.

 Alexander's Star is akin to an "edge-only" Dodecahedron (Megaminx)
without centres. It has 30 edges, that is 15 pairs of distinct
2 coloured edges.

 To calculate the number of permutations of N objects with N1
objects which are like, N2 objects which are like ...
Nrth objects which are like we use the formula:

           N!
     --------------------
     N1! * N2! * ... Nr!


 In the case of Alexander's Star it is a bit more complicated because
we must contend with edge flips and no centres, however I believe the
correct calculation is....

30! / 2^15 * 2^29 / 60 = 72,431,714,252,715,638,411,621,302,272,000,000
                approx = 7.2 * 10^34

I think the term for this is approximately 72 decillion.
(decillion = 10^33)

Here is a bit of an explanation....

There are 30 total objects, with 15 different pairs of 2 like edges.
29 edges may be flipped in any fashion but the 30th edge is forced.
The Great Dodecahedron has 60 orientations in space.

Here is another way to calculate the same number...

Pick one edge and lock it in position and orientation. We still have
29 edges which can move in position and orientation. There are still
28 edges which can be flipped freely, the 29th edge being forced.
We still have 15 different pairs of 2 like edges.

29! / 2^15 * 2^28 = 7.2 * 10^34 (approx)

 To be completely clear the calculation is really
         29!/2   /   2^15/2 * 2^28

....because only half of the 29! arrangements are possible and only
half of the 2^15 arrangements are possible but both the /2's cancel.

 On the Great Cosmic Ranking List this puzzle has less combinations
than Rubik's Revenge, but more than the VIP sphere.

 I know of no Square 1 calculations whatsoever, but would be
interested in seeing anyone's calculations.

Subject: Alexander's Star


	While we are on the subject of the Alexander's star, I have never
been entirely satisfied with the arrangment of its solution.  I've noticed
that most people who look at it don't even know it is solved and I have to
explain that the solution is that all the stickers of pieces laying in a
common plane around the points are the same color.  Hard to say, but I can
point it out to people.  
	To this end I have spent some time trying to find a more satisfying
solution, one more visually clear and simple.  I've only come up with one
alternative that I consider reasonable, and it isn't as pure as I would
like.

	This solution involves grouping colors in the depressions of the
star.  The main problem lies in the fact that the edges come together in
groups of three, but there are 10 stickers of each color so at some point
having all the depressions of the star a single color breaks down.  For
this reason I choose one color (White is my preference) to be an exception
and have it remain in the original configuration, i.e. all in two parallel
planes.  With the rest of the colors, I group them in groups of five: three
in one depression, and two in an adjacent depression with the third color
of this second depression being one of a white.  The result of this is a
set of interlocking "diamonds" that group visually because the are of the
same color.  Unrolled, the star would look like this (this should just fit
on a display of 80 columns):

       /|\             /|\             /|\             /|\             /|\

        (9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16),
        (17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24),
        (25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32) ,
        (1,28)(2,27)(3,26)(4,25)(9,20)(10,19)(11,18)(12,17),
        (5,32)(6,31)(7,30)(8,29)(13,24)(14,23)(15,22)(16,21)
  );;

Within the 2 orbits of 16 pieces any exchange is possible. One
orbit is "polar" and the other is "equatorial".

(28,1) in vip;
true

 Thus on the VIP Sphere a single 2-cycle is legal, although I
know of no simple process as yet.

  The original calculation by Dr. Singmaster was (16!)^2, and
I have confirmed his result with GAP.

I have also played with the Masterball somewhat. This puzzle is awful!
Just how accurately does this thing have to be lined up to turn it?
It locked up several times on me when I tried to randomize it.

 It is the single most difficult puzzle to turn I have ever
encountered, save the Equator puzzle only.

 My first thoughts on calculating the number of positions on the
Masterball was it was the same as the VIP sphere divided by
2^16 but I'm not sure. I can't use GAP in the case of the
Masterball (rainbow edition in this case) to verify this because
of the identical pieces. The booklet which came with the
Masterball refers to some number like 350 quadrillion but there
are more zeroes than the american quadrillion, and I get a
totally different number anyways.

 Thoughts anyone??

From: Michiel Boland <boland@sci.kun.nl>

Hello all,

Had a great time reading the archives. What I haven't found
there are order problems: what is the shortest (in terms of
quarter turns or half- and quarter turns, whatever you prefer)
transformation of the cube with a given order?

Here is a list that my good old PC produced this afternoon.
I hope some of you find this interesting. :)

A couple of notes on the list:

"Len" is the length of the transformation in terms of quarter
twists. You will notice that I listed two transforms with order
3: one is minimal wrt quarter-turn metric, the other wrt
half-turn metric.

A notable absentee is number 11. I suspect that (U.R.F2B.D')2 is
the shortest possible with order 11, but my comp just isn't fast
enough to confirm this.

Note that (U.R.F2B.D')2 yields an 11-cycle on the edges (see
also Mark Longridge's mail from 15 Jul 1994.)

(I use dots to maintain readability; personally, I do not like
the U1F2L3 notation, but that's just a matter of taste :)

I came up with this solution independently.  I also liked on that picked two
opposite depressions on the star and made sure they contained one of each
color.  That allowed me to fill each of the other 18 depressions with
homogenous colors.

Sorry to follow up on my own post, but I messed up a bit :)

>  12      4      U.R.F.D'

There is also U2R2F' which has less face turns but more quarter turns.

>  70      6      U.R'U.R.F.R'

This transform has in fact order 140!
The correct ones are:

 70   6   U.R.U'R.F.B'
 70   7   U2R'U2F'L'

> 110      8      U.R.U2R'F.R.L'

This should be U'R'U.R.F.D'B'L' (8 qt)

I converted my order-searching program to C and am now running
it on a Sun - expecting results on order 11 soon.

I would be curious to hear how you are doing your search.  It is
trivial to see how to calculate the order of a particular
position.  However, it is not obvious to me how to find a
position of a particular order.  I hope it is not the case that
it is in the archives and I just haven't seen it.

I would guess that you are building a search tree of length 0,
length 1, length 2, etc. as has been done many times before,
and calculating the order of each position as you encounter it.
You could then easily build a table of shortest positions of
each order, provided the order appeared in your search.
I would further guess that you have searched down to about
level 6.  However, if that is how you are doing it, I don't
see how you could have proved that the shortest position of
order 110 is of length 8.  I don't see how a PC program could
have searched to level 8 in just a little while.

I use a simple brute-force method, that is, I compute the order
of each transform and the number of quarter turns. If there is
already a transform with that order & number of qt, I forget all
about it and go to the next transform.

I have the C source available for anyone who wants to peek at it.

Note that (almost) all transforms start with UxRx, since you
have to twist two adjacent faces in order to get something with
order other than 1, 2 or 4. That saves a bit of time.

On my PC, i finished all transforms of length 6 (quarter- and
half turns), and did some of length 7. Fortunately, as I
mentioned earlier, I managed to get it to work on a somewhat
faster machine, and am now waiting for the results of that. I am
searching all transforms of 10 quarter turns or less.

A process with order 110 must have an even number of quarter
turns, since the permutation on the edges has to be even (the
only possibility is to have an 11-cycle on the edges, which is
an even permutation).
Therefore, since there are no processes with order 110 with 6 or
less quarter turns, this proves that the one of length 8 is
indeed the shortest possible.

Cheers,

 With GAP we must deal with permutations of cube facelets, and that is
why the permutation 'least' has 3 sets of 8 numbers and 2 sets of
12 numbers. Moreover, as I'm sure Mike will appreciate, the least
commutative element I've found is has a 8-cycle of corners and a
12-cycle of edges.

This sounds to me as though you're assuming that all transforms with a
given order are equivalent as far as deriving further transforms of
other orders go.  That is, if you find that a given transform X of
length L has order N, it sounds as though you're assuming that there is
no need to store any other transforms of length L and order N.  I'm not
convinced this is justified.  If you've found X of (say) length L and
order N, and then find a different Y of length L and order N, I can't
see any justification for the assumption that you can prune the entire
subtree below Y, because if the cycle decompsition of Y is different
from that of X, they may behave entirely differently when followed by
more twists, even though they have the same order.

I do not prune the search tree. If I say I "forget" about Y,
then I do not mean "forget" all transforms that start with Y.
That would be a bad thing, of course.

Subject: number of positions of square1

i also haven't seen any figures for square1 (although i guess that
ideal toy corp.'s generic "more than three billion" might apply).

but it's not hard to derive some figures.  i guess there might be
some question about what constitutes a "position".  i think it's
reasonable to consider only configurations where all three axes
are free to turn.

note that up to rotation, there are 29 different shapes for the
top face.  they occur as 19 symmetric shapes and 5 mirror image
pairs.  these are grouped into five different classes according to
the number of 60 degree pieces ("corners"?), which i'll call doubles.

for each shape, we also count the number of rotationally distinct
orientations, as well as the number of orientations where the
locations of the doubles do not block the half-turn axis.

valid possibilities of the doubles.  each permutation of the doubles
and singles is possible, and the middle layer has two orientations.
any combination of these is possible.  therefore we get a final count

Subject:   <F,U,L,R,D> Question

It is well known that if we define G=<Q> for the twelve quarter turns
q in Q, we can also generate G as G=<F,U,L,R,D>, leaving out B and B'.
Leaving out any other quarter turn would do as well, but I
am going to stick to leaving out B for illustrative purposes.

However, when one of the quarter turns is left out, the length of most
positions will change.  In particular, we will no longer have |B|=1.
My reading of the archives indicates that we do not know what the
length of B would be in this situation, nor what a minimal process
for B would be.

I am going to take a crack at this problem via exhaustive search.
But I like to use representative elements of conjugacy classes in
my searches, and I don't think I can do so in this situation.

For full-blown searches of G, I use M-conjugacy classes.  For subsets
and/or restrictions of G, I use appropriate subsets and/or restrictions
of M.  But I don't think I can use conjugacy classes at all for this
problem.  The group is still G, even though lengths have changed, so
no subset and/or restriction of M is appropriate.  But when G is
generated as <F,U,L,R,D>, we do not necessarily have |X|=|m'Xm|
for all m in M.

Am I missing something obvious?  I don't think so, but in the
meantime I am going to have to start the search without conjugacy
classes.  Bummer.

Subject: pyraminx-like puzzles

Hi
 
  I have a question, I hope this makes sence. ;)   On a "nxnxn"
tetrahedron with period 2 or period 3 turning or a "nxnxn" octahedron with
period 3 or period 4 turning, can the orientation of any of the center
triangles change when the puzzle is solved?  If so, where does this
start to happen.  I know from "experience" that this is not true on
a pyraminx.
 
A Pyraminx, according to me, has period 3 turning where n = 3.  n is the
number of triangles along an edge not counting corners of triangles.
Center triangles are those triangles that are not on an edge (except for
maybe the corners of the triangle).
 
 
A face of a 2x2x2 has one center triangle

A face of a 4x4x4 has 7 center triangles
 
 
  I would like to know this because it will help me in the design of my
puzzles which I am in the process now of converting to Motif (you will
still be able to run them if you just have X).  I hear that a freely

(I am also considering a Windows version and am getting ready to convert them).

Subject:   Preliminary Search Results for <F,U,L,R,D>

The first step in finding |B| in <F,U,L,R,D> is to build a little
Start-rooted data base using only the ten generators F, F', U, U', etc.
I was able to search eight levels deep with a "quick and dirty" search.
To search deeper would take a good bit longer.  I hope that eight levels
will be enough to calculate |B|.  By constructing a companion
B-rooted data base, I should be able to test up to 15 levels deep.
(B is odd, so eight levels deep for each half-depth search only
gets you 15 levels total instead of 16.)

I haven't started the search for B yet, but I thought the
results so far might be of minor interest in their own right.  As
I indicated before, these are actual cube positions.  I haven't
figured out any way to apply conjugacy classes to this problem.

I find it a little puzzling that the branching factor is not
monotonically decreasing (c.f., level 3 to level 4).

   Hi fellow 'netters,

   My name is Samantha Jerrings and I recently started using a magazine
   subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
   deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.
   ...

it's because you're on Cube-Lovers.  Needless to say, I'll be protesting
this misuse of our mailing list.  Please do not respond to -me- about this
message.  And I would certainly encourage you not to order any magazines
from these slime-balls either!

The reference to p201 is incorrect. It should read:

  p175a is a quite interesting position.

Someone also edited my original entry and changed all the T's to U's
which is more consistent and standard.

In addition.....

 There was a standard in the cube contests.

 The original Ideal colour arrangement was the tournament standard in
the U.S. and Canada.

Top=White, Down=Blue, Left=Red, Right=Orange, Front=Yellow, Back=Green

This problem was solved by David Benson in Oct. 1979, who was one of
the earliest cube pioneers. Dr. Singmaster reports on this in his
2nd Addendum of "Notes".

Let A = R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3, then AUA = D1

AUA = R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3 U1 R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3   (17 q, 13 q+h)

Perhaps Jerry will find something shorter.

David Singmaster (ZINGMAST@VAX.SBU.AC.UK) writes on
Wed Sep 13 11:50:09 1995:
------------------------------------------------
 I think the ranking is not quite fair because the puzzles are of
very different types.  E.g. the 15 puzzle has nearly as many patterns
as the 3^3 but no one would claim it was anywhere near as difficult.
Indeed the Babylon Tower has  36!  = 3.72 x 10^41  basic positions.
One can divide by some small value such as 2 or 6 or perhaps more,
depending on what one considers the same position.  This puts it
between 3 and 4 in your list, but it is not a difficult puzzle, except
that it is hard to see the gradations of the colors!  Indeed, the
commercial  7 x 7  'fifteen puzzles' have  49! =6.08 x 10^62  basic
patterns - again one has to divide by something, in this case 2.
This falls between 2 and 3 in your list, but again it is hardly a
difficult puzzle.

 So I think you are comparing puzzles which are of such different
type that the number of patterns is not a fair comparison of their
difficulties.I would group them in three (or perhaps 2) types.
 Rubik Cube, etc.
 Fifteen Puzzles, etc. in the plane.
 Cylindrical Puzzles - barrels, etc.
------------------------------------------------

 I quite agree. One of my reasons for making that list was to simply
rank all the puzzles by number of combinations only, to show the
feasibility (or lack of) for a brute force search to find
God's Algorithm.

 The major drawback, as you point out, is that difficulty in solving
is not only a function of the number of combinations.

Dr. Singmaster continues:
------------------------
 Re your Case E.  Almost all the picture cubes have all four
orientations distinct on the face centres - both those with nine little
pictures on each face and those with a big picture spread over all
nine facelets.  These are actually pretty common.
-------------------------------------------------

 Case E, that is cases that have only a fraction of the total possible
number of combinations for a Rubik's picture cube, are unfortunately
well represented in my own cube collection.

 The following cubes are all in Case E:

 Rubik's Calendar Cube, Rubik's Cube 4th Dimension, Rubik's World,
Blind Man's Cube (from Germany), Royal Wedding Cube (with Charles
& Di).

 Although I don't doubt that, over all, these cases are exceptional.
In the case of Rubik's World there are 3 blank centre pieces, and
in the Royal Wedding Cube only 2 opposite faces can show all 4
possible orientations.

 8. Picture Cube (3x3x3) (E) 8.8*10^22      Erno Rubik, Dan Hoey

Alas, there is little I can currently do about this, beyond complaining to
various postmaster addresses (which I have done).  As the Internet becomes
more of a capitalist free-for-all, even a moderately small mailing list
like Cube-Lovers (less than 200 members) becomes a target for things like
this.  The only real solution, given that it is no longer possible to rely
on people's courtesy, is to go for some kind of moderation.  And in fact, I
am developing some software to moderate Cube-Lovers (and another mailing
list I maintain).  When I'm done, the only changes you all should notice
are: (1) no more junk mail and (2) a slightly longer turnaround time when
you submit a legitimate message.  Until I've got that working all you can
do is ignore these losers.

Briefly, I am a old time cube fan and I am blind.  I have been blind for
about 9 years now due to complications from diabetes.  I recently
encountered a "Braille Or Tactile Rubik's cube" available from Japan.  I
finally received my cube from there after much expense and effort but it
was worth it.

Describing the cube:  it has designs on each side that can easily be
differentiated from the other.  ie; circles, plus, dotted circle,
smooth, six dotsand textured side.  I am now able to solve all but the
last bottom slice from memory but I would like to ask if anyone has a
xolution that I can read that would make sense to me?  I wish to solve
this and then move on to the other puzzles I have read on this list
mentioned.  I will have to mark them tactilly also.
            
Thanks for the time,

Note that there is an e-mail address buried in the message which is
different from the sending e-mail address.  The sending address is a

I agree that U's are more "consistent and standard", but for reasons
that have been discussed several times, T's would probably be better.
However, the effort to switch from U's to T's has not been very
successful.  Personally, I have *tried* to switch to T's, and it just
doesn't feel right.  So I have to share the blame for sabotaging the
switch to T's.

Well, without seeing the original article, I am not sure if I would
agree that the problem was solved or not back in 1979.  By that I
mean that the problem I was proposing to solve was finding a minimal
solution.  I don't know if the original article claimed that 17q
was minimal.

I can now confirm that 17q is indeed a minimal solution.  With my
data base of positions through level 8, I was able to perform half-depth
searches to confirm that there are no solutions through 15q.  Given the
existence of a 17q solution, that is sufficient to show that 17q is
minimal.  But just to be sure, I extended my data base of positions
through level 9, and with my extended data base I was able to find
several solutions of length 17q.

I am not quite sure what we should count as a unique solution.  But I can
report that my search found 16 unique (*not* unique up to conjugacy)
half-way positions.  I use the term "half-way" advisedly.  The "half-way"
positions are 9q from Start and 8q from B or vice versa.  I guess you
could say that the vice versa gives you a total of 32=16+16 half-way
positions, but the whole concept of "half-way" is pretty slippery
in this case anyway.

Just because we know that 17q is minimal does not mean that we know
that 13 q+h is minimal.  I have not done any searches of the q+h case.

With my extended data base, the results of the search with five generators
are as follows:

     Level         Number of       Local      Branching

One more thing, and perhaps this particular problem can be put to rest.
I have mentioned several times that I could not figure out how to
use conjugacy for this particular problem.  Well now I have, although
it is too late for doing the search.  You certainly cannot use
M-conjugacy, but you can use a subgroup of M.  The subgroup includes
four rotations and four reflections.

The four rotations are i, b, bb, and bbb, where we use lower case
letters to simulate Frey and Singmaster's script notation for rotations.
For example, b is the whole cube rotation consisting of grasping
the Back face and rotating the whole cube (not just the Back face)
clockwise by 90 degrees.  For the reflections, we use Dan Hoey's
"permutations of face centers" notation.  The four reflections are
(UL)(DR), (UR)(DL), (UD), and (LR).  To tie the two notations
together, we could write the rotations as i=(), b=(ULDR),
bb=(UD)(RL), and bbb=(URDL).  These eight rotations and reflections
form the subgroup of M which is called Q2 in Dan's taxonomy of
the 98 subgroups of M.  Hence, we could have used Q2-conjugacy, which
would have reduced the size of the problem by about eight times.

If I understand this, there are 16 positions at 9q from Start and 8q
from B, and there are 16 other positions at 8q from Start 9q from B.
Is each of the first bunch adjacent to exactly one of the other?  And
vice versa?  It would be good to get them reduced by Q2-conjugacy, as
well.

The reflections are similarly rrv, rrbv, ttv, and ttbv, where t and r
are the whole-cube rotations by the Top and Right faces, and v is the
central inversion.

Subject: I am in search of Thistlewaite's algorithm


Hi,

As long as I am a new comer to this mailing list, I will briefly
introduce myself. As a computer science researcher, I am working on
evolutionary algorithms trying to assess their ability to solve
combinatorial optimization problems. One of my old dream has been to
solve the Rubik's cube (for the moment, the very basic 3x3x3 version)
with this kind of algorithms. I have heard about the Thistlewaite's
algorithm which is able to solve the problem in less than 50 or so
moves. I have also heard about a publication of D. Singmaster that, among
other things, describes this algorithm. Thus, I am looking for
information about this algorithm: how does it work precisely? I wonder
whether this algorithm, either a description or an implementation of
it, is available somewhere on the net. I would also be interested in
having a copy of D. Singmaster's report (either via ftp or paper).

Can someone help me? Thanks a lot in any case.

Philippe

I don't think I can answer your questions without further analysis,
and I don't have much time to devote to the problem.  But let me
clarify as follows.  First, the search looked as follows:

        Distance from     Distance from      Total       Number of
          Start                 B           Distance      Matching
                                                          Positions

             0                   1             1               0
             1                   2             3               0
             2                   3             5               0
             3                   4             7               0
             4                   5             9               0
             5                   6            11               0
             6                   7            13               0
             7                   8            15               0
             8                   9            17              16

There is a certain arbitrariness in at least two respects.  For one
example, to test for a total distance of 11, you could just as well use
distances from Start and B respectively of 4 and 7 instead of 5 and 6.
For another example, the Start-rooted tree and the B-rooted tree have
identical structures, so the first two columns could be reversed.
Indeed, you could get the B-rooted tree simply by pre-multiplying the
Start-rooted tree by B.  (This reminds me of one of my most
foolish errors on Cube-Lovers.  For search trees where the nodes are
conjugacy classes (or representatives of conjugacy classes), the
tree looks different depending on which class or representative is at
the root.  But when the nodes are all the positions, then the tree is
essentially the same in all cases, just pre-multiplied by the root.
I once claimed the tree structure depended on the root for trees
containing all positions, confusing that situation with the situation
for trees of conjugacy classes.  Arrg!)

Hence, I am not especially comfortable talking about "half-way" positions.
But continuing anyway, denote the 16 positions which are 8 moves from
Start and 9 moves from B as X_i for i in 1..16.  Then, the 16 positions
which are 8 moves from B and 9 moves from Start are B(X_i) for i
in 1..16.  A solution to the problem would then look something like
(X_j)Y(X_k)', where Y is in Q-{B,B'}.  But I don't think we can say
a priori that there is no Z in Q-{B,B'} and no X_m such that
(X_j)Z(X_m)' is also a solution (Z not equal Y and X_m not equal X_k).

I think to analyze the problem properly you would have to take the
positions X_i for i in 1..16 and the positions B(X_j) for j in 1..16
and match up each X_i with each B(X_j) to see which ones differ
by a quarter turn.  Each X_i is going to match up with at least one
B(X_j) and vice versa, but there might be more than 16 matches
overall.

Reduction by Q2-conjugacy is important, but I don't think it would
tell you how many solutions there are that you would really want to
consider to be unique.  Recall the solution of Pons Asinorum by
half-depth searches.  There are 5 positions unique up to M-conjugacy
which are 6q from Start and 6q from Pons.  But most people would
consider that there are only two minimal solutions to Pons that are
really different.  The trouble is that 4 of the 5 half-way positions
for the Pons are in the middle of a sub-process which commutes.

I am not quite sure why it took me so long to figure out that
Q2-conjugation was the appropriate symmetry when generating G
without B and B'.  With the wisdom if hindsight, it is perhaps
because the Q2 subgroup of M could be described as fixing the
B and F face centers, and I was thinking only in terms of fixing
the B face center.  Obviously, you cannot fix the B face center
without also fixing the F face center.  Thus, it is clear that
Q2-conjugation is also the appropriate symmetry when generating
G without F and F'.

Q1 and Q3 are subgroups of M which are conjugate with Q2 in Dan's

Subject:   Correctness of Large Searches

When I was in graduate school in another life many years ago, one of
the big issues was program correctness, and whether programs could
be proven to be correct.  As I recall, the short answer is that
non-trivial programs cannot be proven to be correct.  I haven't
really followed the issue since then, but I doubt that the answer
has changed.

Also, many mathematicians are suspicious or unaccepting of proofs or
other results which involve large computer searches.  For example,
the proof of the Four Color Map Theorem is a famous result involving
a large search which is held in certain suspicion.  For one thing,
the referees for the paper were not able to reproduce the results
of the computer search (not enough computing power).  For another thing,
the referees were neither able to confirm that the programs were error
free (who can?), nor that some sort of computer error (software,
hardware, or procedural) did not occur during the running of the
programs (c.f., the famous Pentium floating point divide error).

Two factors cause me to raise the question of program correctness
at this time.  One is simply that some of the searches we do are
so large, how do we know that the answers are correct?  The other
is that I have found an error in one of my (smaller) searches that
I need to report.

Those of you who actually fight through the details of my longer, more
boring posts will recall that there are essentially three different
models I use from time to time.  For cubes without centers, I usually
use representative elements of sets of the form {m'Xmc}.  For cubes
with centers, I use either representative elements of sets of the
form {m'Xm}, or else I use representatives of the form
Repr{m'Xmc}*C to simulate Repr{m'Xm}.  The latter model is very
compact for cases where complete searches can be accomplished

For the case of the 3x3x3 cube, corners only, with centers, q-turns
only, I recently discovered the following anomaly.  Note in
particular level 8 and below of the search.

The 3x3x3 corners only case has been searched a number of times by
a number of people, all of whom got the same results.  However,
these results all were for every  position, including those which are
M-conjugate.  My searches are for conjugacy classes only, and therefore
I have nobody with whom I can compare results directly.  The only
way I can compare results is to expand the conjugacy classes, and
regrettably I did not do so when I first calculated the corners
only case.

For a variety of reasons to be detailed below, I believe the {m'Xm}
results above are correct and that the {m'Xmc}*C results are incorrect.
But at the same time, I do not believe there is an error per se in
the {m'Xmc}*C model.  Let's see if we can make some sense of this.

When I first discovered the anomaly, my reaction was that
the {m'Xm} model is simpler, and Occum's Razor suggested that
the error was in the {m'Xmc}*C model.  Also, when I expanded
the conjugacy classes for the Repr{m'Xm} model, the results
matched what everybody else had posted.

Hence, I went back to the
{m'Xmc}*C program, which I hadn't looked at in years.  After many
hours of reviewing the model, and many more hours of reviewing
the program itself, I not unsurprisingly found no errors.
Furthermore, I was no longer convinced that Occum's Razor still
applied.  The {m'Xmc}*C model is "more complicated" in some ways,
but on the other hand, every cell of storage for the data base
can be addressed directly.  There is no sorting, merging, and
matching of huge files as there is with the {m'Xm} model.

So I ran the {m'Xmc}*C program again.  Very surprisingly, this time
it produced different answers, and the answers were the same as for
the {m'Xm} model!  So what's going on?  I don't know.

I am presently a bureaucrat (cubing is a hobby), but in previous
lives I have been a technical support person.  In that role, I
have found numerous problems that caused programs to produce incorrect
results, even though the program was "correct" (whatever that means).
I have found hardware errors vaguely similar to the Pentium error,
operating system errors, compiler errors (especially with optimizing
compilers), and subroutine library errors.  So my best guess is that
something of this nature caused the {m'Xmc}*C program to produce
incorrect results one time and correct results another time.
Of course, an uninitialized variable or pointer can cause similar
symptoms, but I have not been able to find anything like that in
my program.

The program is written in Turbo-Pascal for a PC using DOS.  I have
the exact same compiler now I have had for ten years or so.  The
Pascal source code is unchanged from when I ran it before.  The
first time I ran the program, I ran it under DOS, or maybe
in the DOS box in an early version of OS/2 (can't remember for sure),
and it ran on a 286 or an early 386 (can't remember for sure).
This time, it ran in the DOS box under OS/2 Warp on a 486/50.
So lots of things have changed.  Furthermore, both times I ran it,
I used the VDISK facility to cache all the disk files in memory,
and OS/2 Warp surely has a newer VDISK than whatever I was using
before.  I even wondered if the data base was correct the first time,
but maybe I had a bad counting program analyzing the data base.  But
I still had the original data base and counted it again.  It
really was wrong.  So the mystery of the incorrect results is not solved.

In light of the above discussion, I thought it might be appropriate
to summarize some background about my larger searches.  I want to
indicate which ones of them seem pretty well verified, and which ones
of them might benefit from further study.

   <U,R>           -  I believe this one is ok.  I ran the q turn case
                      with and without conjugacy classes.  Upon
                      expanding the conjugacy classes, the results
                      matched the results without conjugacy classes.
                      Also, the results matched results posted by
                      Mark Longridge as far as they went (although
                      my anomaly with corners-only suggests that
                      such matching doesn't prove very much).  I
                      ran the q+h turn case only with conjugacy classes,
                      and expanded then to get the results without
                      conjugacy classes.  The model was Repr{w'Xw}
                      (W-conjugacy instead of M-conjugacy), with
                      much sorting, merging, and matching of external
                      files.

  edges only          This ran for about a year, so there is potential
 (without face        for error.  The model was Repr{m'Xmc}.  The
   centers)           runs to create neighbors were performed primarily
                      on two 486's and a 386, using a mainframe as
                      a file server.  A UNIX station was added for
                      the last few months.  All sorts, merges, and
                      matches were run on the mainframe.  The whole
                      process was driven by REXX scripts on the PC's
                      and UNIX stations (we run REXX on all our UNIX
                      boxes).  There were actually more lines of code
                      for the scripts than for the programs.  The
                      scripts moved files back and forth with FTP,
                      and contained code to detect and correct errors
                      with the FTP's.  The problem has only been
                      run once, so there is no independent verification.

 edges only           This was run twice, once using the {m'Xm} model,
(with face            and once using the Repr{m'Xm}*C model.  The
  centers)            answers matched through level 11.  They did not
                      match at level 12.  I have only posted through
                      level 11 to the list.  I have not had time to
                      find the error.  I do not expect to find the
                      error in any of the programs.  It took about a
                      year to get to level 11, running on the mainframe.
                      I expect the error to be somewhere in a script,
                      probably failing to recover from some error
                      condition like a system failure.  These things
                      run around the clock, and inevitably get caught
                      in system failures from time to time.

                      Although I was not able to do so, this is probably
                      the largest cubing problem where we can conceive
                      of running the problem to completion using today's
                      technology.  Had I been able to do run the problem
                      to completion, the Repr(m'Xm)*C model would have
                      served as verification for the "without face
                      centers" case because the minimum of each
                      row of the solution matrix with centers serves
                      as the solution for the without centers case.

Whole cube            These are the most important runs.  The problem
(edges and corners    has been run twice using the {m'Xm} model, although
 with face centers)   you might not wish to count it as twice.  The
                      difference is that the edges were the major sort
                      in one run, and the corners were the major sort
                      in the other.  The two runs did match, which is
                      a good (but not perfect indication) that there
                      was no error (e.g., such as the
                      scripts failing to include something in
                      in a sort or merge that should have been
                      included).  It would still be nice to have
                      verification by someone else.  I was able to run
                      up through level 11.  I did not try level 12
                      because it was just too big.

Subject: Motif puzzles

Hi
  I converted my puzzles at ftp.x.org in /contrib/games/puzzles to
use Motif.  By default, the puzzles will compile and link with just the
X-Windows includes and libs.
 
  If there is demand, I could supply the Motif versions statically linked
for SunOS4.1.3.  The Motif versions have no increased functionality but may
be easier to use.

I don't know if you received any private replies or not, but I
will take a crack at this one.

There are two places I have personally read about Thistlethwaite's
algorithm.  One is Douglas Hofstadter's article in Scientific
American in March of 1981.  The article is reprinted in Hofstadter's
"Metamagical Themas".  The other is Frey and Singmaster's
"Handbook of Cubik Math".  There are probably other sources as well,
but some of them (e.g., Singmaster's Cubik Circulars) may be hard
to come by at your local library.

Any "by hand" solution to the Cube generally involves something like
"corners first, then edges" (or vice versa), or "top layer, then
middle layer, and finally the bottom layer", or (usually) some
combination or variation of these themes.  Any such theme has
states where it is visually obvious that the cube is becoming
more and more solved.

These plateau states generally have the attribute that they define
a subgroup of G.  For example, the set of states where the top layer
is solved is a subgroup of G.  The subgroups defined by the plateau
states form a nested sequence of subgroups as the Cube becomes
more and more solved.  However, progress is not monotonic.  You
almost always have to give up some of your progress temporarily on
the way to the next plateau.

Thistlethwaite's algorithm reverses the role of the plateau states
and the subgroups.  Instead of plateau states defining nested
subgroups, he has nested subgroups defining plateau states.  In fact,
his nested subgroups are arranged in such a way that once a particular
subgroup is achieved, there is no loss of progress on your way to
the next subgroup.  Also, the plateau states achieved by reaching
the next subgroup are generally not visually obvious, and indeed it
is not visually obvious that any progress at all is being made until
the cube is almost solved.

The nested subgroups given by Frey and Singmaster are as follows.
I believe that other nested subgroups have been used as well.

     H0=<L,R,F,B,U,D>=G
     H1=<L,R,F,B,U2,D2>
     H2=<L,R,F2,B2,U2,D2>
     H3=<L2,R2,F2,B2,U2,D2>
     H4=<I>

I do not recall seeing any practitioners of Thistlethwaite's algorithm
posting to Cube-Lovers.  However, there are several practitioner's
of an algorithm called Kociemba's algorithm who contribute to
Cube-Lovers.  Kociemba's algorithm is a close cousin to Thistlethwaite's,
but does not depend on pre-searching as does Thistlethwaite's.  Also,
I believe that the best Kociemba programs now utilize only two
nested subgroups, and are able to achieve results far better than
those achieved by Thistlethwaite.

As I understand it, Kociemba's algorithm differs from Thistlethwaite's
in two primary respects.  Kociemba uses searching, and Thistlethwaite
uses tables (what I called "pre-searching" in the previous paragraph).
Also, Thistlethwaite simply hooks the nested subgroups together and
stops when they are hooked, whereas Kociemba continues searching
to see if improvements are possible by merging the nested subgroups
at their boundaries.

As I mentioned recently:

> The original Ideal colour arrangement was the tournament standard in
> the U.S. and Canada.
>
> Top  =White,  Down =Blue
> Left =Red,    Right=Orange
> Front=Yellow, Back =Green

Dan Hoey mentions:
> manufactured with opposite faces ``differing by yellow''--red opposite
> orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite white--

 The ``differing by yellow'' colouring was pretty common on those
"Wonderful Puzzlers".

 The only difference in original Ideal cubes colouring and the
Wonderful Puzzlers colouring is that Blue and Yellow are transposed.

I just the 3 Dino Cubes I ordered from Gametrends.
More new cubes!

There are 3 different kinds:

A) Each of the 6 faces of the cube is a unique solid colour.
B) Each of the 6 faces of the cube is a unique solid colour with four
 dinosaurs (six different dinos, 1 kind for each face)
C) Each of the 4 tetrads is a unique colour.

The Dino colouring is: (Just like the puzzlers)

TOP  =White, DOWN =Yellow
LEFT =Red,   RIGHT=Orange
FRONT=Blue,  BACK =Green

The packaging is a small white cardboard box devoid of any
trademarks. The name on the box is "Dinosaur Rubik's Cube".

All the regulars on cube-lovers will make mincemeat of this puzzle,
and the 4 colour version is easier still! The mechanism is
quite good (nice and smooth) and it is a good puzzle to have.

The 6 colour version has 19,958,400 combinations.
The 4 colour version has only 42,600 combinations.

Subject:   Re: Positions 8q from Start, 9q from B, Five Generators
In-Reply-To: Message of 10/17/95 at 19:44:40 from BRYAN@wvnvm.wvnet.edu

I can add a bit of additional information.  The 16 positions
8q from Start and 9q from B can be reduced to 4 positions
unique up to Q2-conjugacy.  As I have discussed before,
it is still difficult to claim that the 4 positions are really
"different" without further analysis because of the possibility
that the positions are variations within a commuting subsequence
of moves.

I don't really have a Q2-conjugacy program.  It would be easy to
make one, but I don't have time so I used my M-conjugacy program.
Recall that Q2={i,b,bb,bbb,rrv,rrbv,ttv,ttbv}, where b, r, and
t are whole cube rotations of the Back, Right, and Top faces,
respectively, and v is the central inversion.  For 12 of the
16 positions X the program reports Symm(X)={i}, which is to say
m'Xm is not equal X for any m in M except the identity.  Obviously,
the same is true for all m in Q2 since Q2 is a subgroup of M.  We
have |Q2|=8, so |{m'Xm | m in Q2}=6.  Therefore, the 12 positions
for which Symm(X)={i} form two Q2-conjugacy classes.

Using the M-conjugacy program for the other 4 positions is trickier,
but only slightly so.  For the other 4 positions, the M-conjugacy
program reports Symm(X)=HX, where HX={i,bb,rr,tt,v,bbv,rrv,ttv}.
But HX is not a subgroup of Q2, and what we need is sort of
"Symm(X) with respect to Q2", which I will call Symm(X/Q2).
(A better notation is probably available).  It is easy to see
that Symm(X/Q2)=(Symm(X) intersect Q2), and we have
(HX intersect Q2)={i,ttv,bb,rrv}.  This subgroup is called
HQ2 in Dan's taxonomy.

We have |Q2|=8 and |HQ2|=4, so |{m'Xm | m in HQ2}|=2
when Symm(X/Q2)=HQ2.  Therefore, the last 4 positions form
two Q2-conjugacy classes.

There are two papers by Morwen Thistlethwaite on this subject, both dating

I got these copies from David Singmaster after having tried unsuccessfully
to get them from Morwen himself. 
I have since then made many copies of these notes for many people all around

I will continue to do this as long as I feel comfortable about it.

Hi
Recently I asked the question:

Well, if you believe proof by example on a simulated puzzle, then
Tetrahedron period 2 turning: never happens
Tetrahedron period 3 turning: starts when n=4 with center triangle
Octahedron period 3 turning: starts when n=4 with center triangle
Octahedron period 4 turning: starts with n=4 with center triangle
 
New versions of my pyraminx and octahedron puzzles will be out soon
to reflect this.
 
Cheers,

Subject: Embedding G in a symmetrical group
Date: Fri, 20 Oct 95 02:41:55 +0100
From: Michiel Boland <boland@sci.kun.nl>

It is clear that the group G of the cube (the one with
4.3252x10^19 elements) can be embedded in a
symmetrical group, e.g. S_48, since each move of the cube can be
seen as a permutation of 48 objects. Hence, there is a smallest
number n such that G can be embedded in S_n. I'm curious to find
out what this number is.

It can be shown with some counting arguments that n>=32 (I'm
happy to write these down but it's nicer if you thought about
this first). I would be surprised if n=32 but you never know.

Well, I did get up to 12 q turns deep ;-)
Good enough for 2 half deep searches...

 But there is another possible verification method by counting the
number of even positions and odd positions and totalling them.

This is almost Cube Philosophy... how can we be certain about the true
nature of God's Algorithm? How can we be certain our cube databases
are completely accurate? I suppose it is not really a big problem
as long as the various cube programs all agree, and a human
observer executes such processes on a real cube.

Um...If I were a better net.person, I'd look up which version of the cube 
has that number of elements, but wouldn't it be correct to say that each 
move of the cube is a permutation of the pieces of the cube, i.e. the 26 
cubies?  (Or even, depending on which cube-model you are using(This is 
what I should have looked up), if you ignore center cubie orientation, 
the 20 cubies?)

If that logic holds, then the largest possible S_n would be S_20, much 
less than the 32 that you claim is minimal...

...I think I'm just confused--can you alleviate that problem?

Subject: Old question about 2 adj edges

Hello!

I want to ask if somebody can tell me how to flip 2 adj. edges (and nothing
else) in 4x4x4 cube? I have my own formula to do this but i cannot write it
down because i have to discover it every time ;) and i turn whole cube so
many times during it. I remember 39 or 40 turns have been the shortest way
i've seen. What i need is that formula in BFUDLR (or something) language.

I have another question about this mailing list. I have seen many lists
similar to cube-lovers in my .nersrc file. Can i find cube-lovers list
somewhere with my newsreader?

Thanks.

But my incorrect results for the 3x3x3 Corners plus face centers
passed this test, and were still incorrect.  Indeed, the incorrect
search found all the positions, the parity of all the lengths
was correct, the maximum length was correct, and the number of
positions at the maximum length was correct.  Yet, some of the
lengths were incorrect.

>else) in 4x4x4 cube?

That reminds me of a question I have been meaning to ask for a long time.
But first here is some context, involving some reminisces about when
I first figured out how to solve the cube.

After buying my first cube, it took me about a week to figure out how
to solve everything except two edges cubies which were flipped.  It took
me about another week to figure out how to unflip them.  Since then, I have
discovered that about half the time, my method of solution yields two
flipped edge cubies which have to be unflipped, and about half the time
it doesn't.  Fair enough  --  50-50 chance, I guess.  (When I am in
practice, I can see the flipped edge cubies coming, and can compensate
as a part of the process of getting the last few edge cubies in place,
but I am seldom really in practice.)

The 4x4x4 was a little tougher.  It took me about a week to figure out
how to solve everything except two edge cubies which were exchanged.
It took me about another year(!) to figure out how to exchange them.

On the 3x3x3, I solve the corners first, then the edges.  I use the
same general method on the 4x4x4, except that there are four face
centers (if you can call them that) on each face to deal with.  So
I solve the corners first, which establishes a frame of reference.
Then, I solve the face centers with respect to the frame of reference
established by the corners.  Finally, I solve the edges.  All the
operators are identical or similar to the ones I use for the 3x3x3.

For the longest time, I thought that a parity argument made one
exchange of the edges impossible, and I was just sure that somebody
was taking my cube apart and putting it back together when I wasn't
looking.  I went through two or three cycles of taking it apart
myself and putting it back together in Start, scrambling it, and
trying to solve it, all in one sitting, before I was convinced that
you really could have just one exchange of the edges.

What I didn't see originally was that there could be invisible
movement of the face centers to compensate for the "bad parity" of
the edges.  I am very poor at solving the 4x4x4, but here is how I
do it.  When I get the "bad parity", I make one slice move (doesn't
disturb the corners), and then solve the face centers again without
simply undoing the once slice move and without worrying about the
edges.  Then, upon solving the edges the second time, there is
"good parity" and all is well.

Finally, here is my question.  On the 4x4x4, I get "bad parity" darn
near every time.  Why isn't it 50-50 like the situation I have with
flips on the 3x3x3?

You are forgetting the twists of the corner cubies and the flips of the
edge cubies.

As an aside, the S_48 upper bound is already based on ignoring the face
centers (i.e., 8 facelets on each of 6 faces of the cube).

It took me about 6 years. That problem was a little background process in my
brains. Then i went to the army. In the evenings i used to 'play' with 4x4x4
until one day. I noticed the same thing as you. 2 flipped edges can be
solved by turning one inner slice 90 degrees. Since then i haven't
discovered anythig new about this parity problem. That's why i asked if
anyone could do it less than 39 turns.

>What I didn't see originally was that there could be invisible

I have thought the center piece movements too. It must be very hard to see a
parity from certers, even if they were marked (position and orientation).
There are so many different 'right' positions too.

This reminds me another old question: 3x3x3 are told to have about 4
trillion (or whatever) different positions. How many of these positions are
'solved cube' but with different centerpiece combinations? Once i had 3x3x3
with 6 different pictures (picture/side). Friends asked me to solve it. When
i was completed, they laughed at me and pointed the bottom center piece,
which was out of orientation (i can't remember how many of centers were out
of order).

>Finally, here is my question.  On the 4x4x4, I get "bad parity" darn
>near every time.  Why isn't it 50-50 like the situation I have with

I don't know, but i guess: 1/4 you get it right and 3/4 goes wrong. I think
we must count that there are 2 inner slice states: right and wrong. There
are also 2 outer slice states: right and wrong (2 corners at wrong
position). It makes me think that 1/4.

My suspicion is that "bad" or "good" parity is determined by what your
formulae are composed of.  An even number of center-plane moves will
preserve parity, and the opposite is true for odd center-plane moves.

If there really is a reason you're getting bad parity moves, that could
determine it.

However, I ran into a straight of 5 "good parity" situations recently,
and didn't really notice it until later, so perhaps it's a psychological
phenomenon as well (we gloss over good happenings, and dwell on tragedies.)

Actually, I think the 4 "trillion" estimate is ignoring the center orientation.
Let's see:
  8! corner positions
x 3^7 corner orientations
x 12!/2 edge positions
x 2^11 edge orientations
= 4.325x10^19
Well, forty-three quadrillion.

Five center orientations force the sixth, so multiply your number by 4^5 to 
get the answer 4.429x10^22 positions, counting center piece 
orientations.  That's 44 quintillion.  Whew.

I remember when I solved the 5x5x5 cube (finally), someone asked me if I
had solved the "invisible" 3x3x3 inside it.  I'm not sure I even want to
think of trying to solve that.  I'll work on the 3x3x3x3 first.  :P

My permutation group memory is rusty.  Is it the "degree" of G you're
asking for?

I also get n = 32 as the smallest |S_n| divisible by |G|.  I suspect
one can argue |G| must divide |A_n| (still requiring only n >= 32),
and if we can argue |G|*12 must divide |S_n| (accounting for all
parities of edges and corners) we get n >= 33.

On the flip side, I'll assert G has degree <= 42 (which is less than
the obvious representation in S_48).  If anyone can prove me either
right or wrong, please do so.  My assertion is based on the following
hand-waving argument:

G is a wreath product (or some kind of product) of the following
subgroups:
A:  S_8   8! corner positions
B:  3^7   3^7 corner orientations
C:  A_12  12!/2 edge positions
D:  2^11  2^11 edge orientation

Clearly subgroup A has degree 8 and C has degree 12.  

I claim (wave hands wildly:-) that BxD has degree at most 22, since it
can be embedded in an S_22.  I use every even factor of 22! for a component
of 2^11, and every third factor of 22! for a component of 3^7.  

Divisibility arguments suggest some smaller S_n might embed 2^11x3^7,
but I don't know whether such embeddings can be realized.  This is an
obvious area to consider for lowering the upper bound on degree(G).  By
divisibility we can conceivably embed 2^11x3^7 in an S_18, but not in
an S_17.

Finally, the degree of a wreath(?) product is bounded by the sum of
the degrees of the multiplicands, hence 
degree(G) <= 8 + 12 + 22 = 42.

If this (alleged) degree 42 construction is valid, is 42 minimal?  I
strongly doubt it.
