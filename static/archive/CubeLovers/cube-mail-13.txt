                      Notes on the UR Group
                      ---------------------

 Well, some small news about the < U, R > group. Previously I believed
that my 3-cycle of edges:

    UR1 = U3 R3 U2 R1 U1 R3 U1 R1 U1 R1 U2 R3 U3 R1 U3 R3 = 18 q, 16 h

...discovered by hand was minimal. My newly created < U, R > solver
(now being at the point of churning out correct results) as
happily proven me wrong!

    UR2 = U3 R1 U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R2 U3 R3 U3 R2 U1 = 16 q, 13 h


Also I found 6 "UR-Reflective" processes altogether. This is all
 there are up to and including 12 q turns:

  U3 R1 U1 R1 (U2) R3 U3 R3 U1 = R3 U1 R1 U1 (R2) U3 R3 U3 R1   (10)
  U1 R3 U3 R3 (U2) R1 U1 R1 U3 = R1 U3 R3 U3 (R2) U1 R1 U1 R3   (10)
                 ( U2 R2 ) ^ 3 = ( R2 U2 ) ^ 3                  (12)
    U1 R1 U2 R3 U2 R3 U2 R1 U1 = R1 U1 R2 U3 R2 U3 R2 U1 R1     (12)
            ( U1 R1 U3 R3 ) ^3 = ( R1 U1 R3 U3 ) ^3             (12)
            ( U3 R3 U1 R1 ) ^3 = ( R3 U3 R1 U1 ) ^3             (12)


 The program is still a sluggish beast, but I think with further
refinements it should eventually find other interesting results
like antipodes and pure twists, etc.

Some of you may remember previous results where I calculated equivalence
classes of the form {m'Xmc} for all 48 elements m in M, the set of all
cube rotations and reflections, and for all 24 elements c in C, the set
of all cube rotations.  This is effectively calculating M-conjugate classes
for centerless cubes.  My previous data bases have contained
representative elements Y for each equivalent class {m'Xmc}.  To get
cubes with centers (where rotational orientation makes a difference),
I then calculated Yc for each c in C, forming a matrix indexed by
Y and c.

The previous approach permits a very compact representation of God's
algorithm, and I used it for corners-only cubes and am presently
using it for edges-only cubes.  However, I find that the {m'Xmc}
approach does not work well for whole cubes.  The problem is that
the matrix is extremely sparse close to Start.  With corners-only
or edges-only cube, I can calculate the entire problem.  With the
whole cube, I cannot even come close to calculating the whole problem,
and the matrix representation wastes space rather than saving space.

Hence, for whole cubes, I am calculating equivalence classes (which
are M-conjugate classes) of the form {m'Xm} for all 48 elements m in M.
My data base includes a representative element Z for each M-conjugate
class {m'Xm}.  This reduces the size of the problem by about 48 times,
and lets me calculate about two more levels of the search tree with the
same level of effort as before.

Just to reiterate some obvious points that have appeared before:

   1) X is an arbitrary element of {m'Xm}, but Z is a particular element
      of {m'Xm} chosen with a selection function.

   2) Z is in {m'Xm} and we have {m'Zm} = {m'Xm}.

   3) |Z| = |X| = |m'Xm| = |m'Zm| for all m in M and for all X in
      {m'Xm}.  This trivial equivalence is what makes M-conjugate
      classes a viable approach for brute force calculation of
      God's algorithm.

   4) Most M-conjugate classes of the form {m'Xm} contain 48 elements.
      The size of {m'Xm} can be used as a measure of the symmetry of
      X, with |{m'Xm}|=1 for the most symmetric cubes and |{m'Xm}|=48
      for the least symmetric cubes.  Conversely, Symm(X) is the
      set of all m in M such that m'Xm=X.  |Symm(X)|=48 for the
      most symmetric cubes, |Symm(X)|=1 for the least symmetric cubes,
      and |{m'Xm}| * |Symm(X)| = 48 in all cases.

   5) The ratio of cubes to M-conjugate classes is close to, but not
      exactly equal to, 48.  The reason the equality is inexact is
      symmetry (see item #4 above). The ratio is closer to 48 when
      you get further from Start because the proportion of asymmetric
      cubes is higher when you are further from Start.

I actually calculated (and previously reported) God's Algorithm directly
through level 8.  For levels 9 and 10, I only calculated the number of
M-equivalence classes directly.  I then calculated the size of each
M-equivalence class to obtain the number of cubes.  This particular data
base has 14 bytes for each cube (actually for each representative element
Z).  Hence, 14*139,629,194= 1,954,808,716 bytes are required to store
level 10 (each level is in a separate file).  This is about
2 gigabytes of storage, which is quite large, but which is by no means
outrageous.

Subject:   M-Conjugate Classes as a Group

C is the set of twenty-four rotations of the cube.  After much
bungling (see my notes of 13 Feb 1994, 23 May 1994, and 19 July 1994),
I showed that the left cosets of C, denoted by xC or {Xc}, form
a group, and that the group is isomorphic to a subgroup of G.  I consider
this to be important because I use left cosets of C to model
centerless cubes.

M is the set of forty-eight rotations and reflections of the cube.
I often model the cube with M-conjugate classes of the form {m'Xm}.
Therefore, it seems that I should try to define an operation such that
the M-conjugate classes form a group, and such that the group is
isomorphic to a subgroup of G.

I would like to start by reviewing briefly the results for left cosets.
Two operations were defined:

   1.a.  {Xc} * {Yc} = {(VW)c}
   1.b.     V ** W   = (VW)

where V and W are representative elements of {Xc} and {Yc}, respectively.
Further, the mapping V <--> {Vc} defines an isomorphism between the
set of left cosets and the operation * on the one hand, and the set of
representative elements and the operation ** on the other hand.  Since
the ** operation is simply normal cube multiplication and since the
set of representative elements are a group under **, the set of
representative elements form a subgroup of G.

I tried to define groups without using representative elements and failed.
Not only that, the representative elements had to be selected in a
special way rather than arbitrarily.  For example, we could choose as
the representative element of {Xc} the unique element V such that the
ur cubie is positioned properly.

Positioning the ur cubie properly is not the only selection function for
a representative element which will work, but any selection function must
satisfy two criteria in order to work:

    A. It must select a representative element based on a property which
       is possessed by exactly one element of each coset.

    B. There must be closure in the sense that if V is the representative
       element of {Xc} and W is the representative element of {Yc},
       then (VW) must be the representative element of {(VW)c}.

Criterion #B merits some additional discussion.  First, it is the
criterion that really proves you have a group.  Associativity
for a subset of a group generally follows from the the associativity
of the group.  For a finite group, closure for a subset implies
the identity and the complement for the subset, so closure is the key
factor in demonstrating that a set of cubes is a group.  Second,
criterion #B will bear directly on our attempt to define a group
operation for the M-conjugate classes.

Suppose we choose not to require criterion #B.  We still need to
have closure in order to have a group.  We could obtain closure by
brute force as follows:

   2.a.  {Xc} * {Yc} = {(Repr{(VW)c})c}
   2.b.     V ** W   = Repr{(VW)c}

It is probably a little easier to see what is going on in equation
2.b. than in 2.a., but it is the identical mechanism in both cases.
Suppose we don't have closure.  That is, suppose the selection
function operates in such a way that if V is the representative
element of {Xc} and W is the representative element of {Yc} that
(VW) is not necessarily the representative element of {(VW)c}.
We can still find the representative element of {(VW)c} by simply
applying the selection function, which we have done.

Equations 2.a and 2.b define groups, where the left cosets are
a group under * and the representative elements are a group under
**.  Furthermore, the mapping V <--> {Vc} defines an isomorphism
between the two groups.  But even though the set of representative
elements is a subset of G, and even though they form a group under **,
they are not a subgroup of G.  The problem is that the operation
** as defined by equation 2.b. is not the same operation as
standard cube multiplication as it was in equation 1.b.

Now, let's look at M-conjugate classes.  By analogy with the left
coset case, there are two possibilities to define a group:

   3.a.  {m'Xm} * {m'Ym} = {m'(VW)m}
   3.b.       V ** W     = (VW)

   4.a.  {m'Xm} * {m'Ym} = {m'(Repr{m'(VW)m})m}
   4.b.       V ** W     = Repr{m'(VW)m}

As before, X and Y are any cubes in G, and V and W are the
representative elements of {m'Xm} and {m'Ym}, respectively.

In order to make 3.a. and 3.b. work, we need some characteristic
which can be used by the selection function which possesses the
properties of uniqueness and closure as defined by #A and #B
above.  But I can't think of any such property, and I don't think
such a property exists (see below).

4.a and 4.b certainly work.  That is, they define operations
* and ** under which the set of M-conjugate classes and the set
of representative elements, respectively, form groups, and the
groups are isomorphic under the mapping V <--> {m'Vm}.
However, the groups fail to be subgroups of G for the same reason
elements of left cosets fail to be subgroups of G under equation 2.b.
Namely, the ** operation is not really the same operation as
normal cube multiplication.

As to the question of whether 3.a. and 3.b. can be made to work,
I think we can prove that they cannot.  Suppose the contrary.
That is, suppose that there is some property such that it is
possessed by exactly one element of each M conjugancy class and
such that the normal cube product of two such elements also
possesses the property.  Then, it would be the case that the
set of representative elements would be a subgroup of G.  But the
number of representative elements is the same as the number of
M conjugate classes, and the number of M conjugate classes is
known not to divide the number of cubes in G evenly.  Hence,
the set of representative elements of M-conjugate classes is not
a subgroup of G.  Working backwards contrapositively, the desired
property cannot exist.

So, the final result is that the set of M conjugate classes can be
made into a group, and the set of representative elements of the
M conjugate classes can be made into a group.  But neither group
is a subgroup of G, nor is either group isomorphic to any
subgroup of G.

Subject:   Re: < U, R> Group
In-Reply-To: Message of 08/09/94 at 01:48:00 from mark.longridge@canrem.com

I wanted to get back to some of the symmetry considerations associated
with the Two-Generator Group.  In particular, I wanted to calculate
God's Algorithm in terms of something analogous to M-conjugates.
I haven't started the calculations, but I wanted to go ahead and
discuss what those calculations will consist of.

First, we can make the obvious observation that the <U,R> group is not
the only Two-Generator group.  Any two adjacent faces can serve
as generators for a Two-Generator Group, and there are twelve such
pairs of adjacent faces.  All twelve groups have identical structures,
and are isomorphic under M-conjugation.

With respect to any particular Two-Generator Group such as <U,R>, the
associated symmetry group is not M, it is a subgroup of M.  Dan Hoey
has determined that M has 98 subgroups, and that the 98 subgroups
may be grouped into 33 classes.  Dan has developed a taxonomy for the
33 classes and 98 subgroups.  I have seen bits and pieces of Dan's
taxonomy posted to the list, and he has sent me a good bit of it
via private E-mail, but I don't think I have ever seen the whole thing
all in one piece.  In any case, let's talk a little bit about the
98 subgroups and 33 classes.

Frey and Singmaster use script characters to describe whole cube
rotations.  For the purposes of this note, I will use lower
case letters.  For example, r will be used to describe grabbing
the right face and turning the whole cube 90 degrees clockwise
(to be distinguished from R, which means to turn only the right
face 90 degrees clockwise).  In this notation, <r> = {i,r,rr,rrr}
is one of the 98 subgroups of M.  (Note that <l> is the same
group as <r>.)  Similarly, <u> = {i,u,uu,uuu} and
<f> = {i,f,ff,fff} are subgroups of M.  The groups <r>, <u>, and
<f> have identical structures (isomorphic under rotation), and the
collection (<r>, <u>, <f>) is one of Dan's 33 classes.

Similarly, (<r2>, <u2>, <f2>) is another of Dan's 33 classes.  <r2>
is a subgroup of <r>, <u2> is a subgroup of <u>, and <f2> is a
subgroup of <f>.  Dan's taxonomy includes a complete description
of group-subgroup relationships within the subgroups of M, or maybe
I should say that it is a complete description of class-subclass
relationships.

The Frey-Singmaster script notation is adequate for rotations, but it
is not adequate for reflections.  Instead, I will use a notation which
I believe originated with Dan Hoey (e.g., 28 Dec 1993).  For example,
you could write r=(FUBD), where the upper case letters describe movements
of whole faces (*not* quarter-turns in this context!).  (FUBD) means Front
goes to Up goes to Back goes to Down goes to Front, which is what happens
when you perform r.  In the same notation, a Front-Back reflection
would be (FB), etc.

With that all said, the symmetry group for <U,R> is

  <(UR)(DL),(FB)> = {I, (FB), (UR)(DL), (FB)(UR)(DL)}

In Dan's taxonomy, this group is a member of the W class, and there
are six such groups  -- W1 through W6.  I am not sure which one this one
is (I only have a list of the classes, not of the groups), but let's
say for the sake of the argument it is W3.  Then for <U,R>, I will
be calculating W3-conjugate classes of the form {w'Xw} for all w in
W3.  The size of the problem will be reduced by about four times,
compared to a reduction of about forty-eight times for whole cube
problems where M-conjugation can be used.

I was initially surprised that there are twelve groups M-conjugate with
<U,R>, but only six corresponding symmetry groups in M.  This arises,
for example, because the <U,R> and <D,L> (diagonally opposed) groups share
the same symmetry group.  I really shouldn't have been surprised.
After all, we know how many subgroups of G there are, namely
"over three beelion" (Dan Hoey, 20 Aug 1992), and we know how
many subgroups of M there are, namely 98.  Since "over three beelion"
is a lot more than 98, there must be many, many subgroups of G
which share the same symmetry properties in the sense of sharing
a subgroup of M.

Subject:   Re: < U, R> Group (W-conjugate results)
In-Reply-To: Message of 08/09/94 at 01:48:00 from mark.longridge@canrem.com

I have completed the God's Algorithm calculations for the <U,R> group
in terms of W-conjugate classes (or really, in terms of representative
elements of W-conjugate classes), with the results below.  In general,
the use of W-conjugates reduces the size of the problem by about
four times.  However, I was surprised to see that for levels 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, and 11 the number of cubes was exactly four times larger than the
number of W-conjugate classes.  My interpretation is that all cubes
in <U,R> at these levels are completely "asymmetric" with respect to
W.  (They are somewhat symmetric with respect to M, of course.)  However,
when level 13 turned out not to have a ratio of exactly 4 between cubes
and W-conjugate classes, I was rescued from the task of explaining why
all cubes at an odd distance from Start were asymmetric.

HI

  I've been busy updating X puzzles on ftp.x.org in /contrib/games/puzzles.     
Here's the blurb from the xpuzzle.README file there. 
-------------------------------
What's new?:                   
xrubik now has a undo, save, and recall
  as well as self-solver (computer solves cube) up to 3x3x3.
  Currently it is the only one in this collection with a self-solver,  
  undo, save, and recall.
xmball recently added, atan2 problem on Suns fixed
xmlink recently added, initialize error fixed                      
xhexagons minor update  
                        
The collection includes:          
SLIDING BLOCK PUZZLES                       
xcubes:         expanded 15 puzzle                                       
xtriangles:     same complexity as 15 puzzle                             
xhexagons:      2 modes: one ridiculously easy, one harder than 15 puzzle
                                          
ROTATIONAL 3D PUZZLES                                      
  hold down control key to move whole cube                 
  letters that represent colors can be changed in mono-mode  

xrubik:         a nxnxn Erno Rubik's Cube(tm) (or Magic Cube)
                self-solves 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 (non-orient mode).
xpyraminx:      a nxnxn Uwe Meffert's Pyraminx(tm) (and Senior Pyraminx),
                a tetrahedron with Period 2, Period 3, and Combined cut modes
                and it also a sticky mode to simulate a Halpern's Tetrahedron
                or a Pyraminx Tetrahedron
xoct:           a nxnxn Uwe Meffert's Magic Octahedron (or Star Puzzler) and
                Trajber's Octahedron with Period 3, Period 4, and Combined
                cut modes and it also includes a sticky mode
xskewb:         a Meffert's Skewb (or Pyraminx Cube), a cube with diagonal cuts
xmball:         a variable cut Masterball(tm), variable number of latitudinal
                and longitudinal cuts on a sphere, where the longitudinal cuts
                permit only 180 degree turns.

COMBINATION ROTATIONAL AND SLIDING 3D PUZZLES
xmlink:         a nxm Erno Rubik's Missing Link(tm)

Future directions:
  Sorry about the lack of self-solvers, but I would rather write the puzzle
  than the tedious solution.
  The ability to take back moves, record moves, and start with a
  entered position to other puzzles besides xrubik should be done.
  Currently the saved file for xrubik is cryptic (not intentionally).
  Also xmlink and xmball need better algorithms for drawing sectors than just
  a series of arcs.
  A Billion Barrel would be nice but only with a self-solver (the puzzle is
  too hard (I confess, I never solved it)).

Newbies (especially DOS users 8-) ):
  DOS/Windows & Mac users, sorry no port currently available.
  What you need:
    80386 or better, or Risc, etc.
    UNIX: Linux and FreeBSD are freely available (it may work on VMS).
    X: XFree86 is freely available on Linux and FreeBSD distributions.
    gunzip: freely available from GNU and the above distributions.
    tar: freely available from GNU also.
  What you do:
    After transfering the PUZZLE file to your machine
        (DOS users may want to rename the file PUZZLE.tar.gz to PUZZLE.tgz)
      gunzip PUZZLE.tar.gz  (or gunzip PUZZLE.tgz)
      tar xvf PUZZLE.tar
        (tar xvzf PUZZLE.tar.gz or tar xvzf PUZZLE.tgz may work as a short cut)
    Then read the README generated by the above command.

I hope you enjoy

COMMERCIAL POSTING

September 30, 1994

Dear Puzzle Enthusiast:

        Sometimes the pieces of a puzzle just seem to fall into place.
For the Fall season, we have several new puzzles whose pieces may easily
fall into place for you. Or perhaps they'll prove more challenging than
watching autumn leaves.

         Chief among our Fall puzzles is our new plastic puzzle, Sneaky
Squares.  It's hard to talk about this puzzle without saying that it is
truly a great puzzle. A great puzzle should be simple in concept and design,
but require a right angle turn of the mind in order to arrive at the
solution. Sneaky Squares was invented by veteran puzzle designer Bill
Cutler. He calls it his finest achievement. It consists of just 4 blocks
that must be fitted into a box. What could be simpler you say? Yet it
stumps 99% of the people we show it to. But, once you have figured out
the solution, you can demonstrate it to your friends in seconds. Because
of its simple elegance, this is an excellent gift for people who might
be intimidated by a complex or esoteric puzzle.

        At just $15, Sneaky Squares is a must for your collection, and a
great gift for your friends!

        Birds of an entirely different feather comprise the Perplexing Poultry
series of puzzles. These intriguing puzzles, from England, are based on
the tiling theories of mathematician and cosmologist Roger Penrose.
Penrose became interested in the shapes of tiles that will cover a plane.
Some regular shapes (such as squares) do this, but Penrose came up with
a number of irregular tile sets that could cover a plane. These tiles
produce patterns that are non-periodic (that is, the patterns do not
repeat). They are called 'quasi-periodic' since the pattern appears
to repeat regularly until you examine it closely. (Scientists have
since found some real-world crystals that form in a quasi-periodic way.)

        The quasi-periodic tile sets make interesting puzzles. To decide the
position of the next tile you place, you must take into account more
than just the neighbor tiles -- you have to think about the 'whole-board
position.'

        Choose either a color or black and white version of the Perplexing
Poultry.
The Black & White is reminiscent of the work of M.C. Escher. (Many of
Escher's drawings, incidentally, are examples of periodic tiling.)
Additionally, four of the tile sets have been made into jigsaw puzzles.
The jigsaws are unusual and colorful. 500 die-cut pieces build to a 19"
diameter circle in each of them. Although these are conventional jigsaws,
they are quite difficult because of the quasi-periodicity of the pattern.
See the enclosed flyer for illustrations of each jigsaw and for more
information about Perplexing Poultry.

         As a special offer, to get your fingers moving as fast as your brain,
we'll throw in free shipping on orders of $50 or more, if you place them
by October 15! So hurry and dig into these new brainteasers.

        Happy puzzling,

        James W. Connelley
        President
        Ishi Press International

P.S. We picked up a limited number of Circusmaster and Dragonmaster
Masterballs at a special price. Masterball is a rotational puzzle
with the sphere divided along lines of latitude and longitude.
Masterballs usually sell for $19.95. While they last, we are offering
these at the special price of just $11.70 each. Because they came
from a European shop, the packaging is not in perfect condition, but
the puzzles are just fine. Take advantage of this special offer before
we run out!

Alas, no antipodes yet, but some interesting results nonetheless.
Process UR8 improves on the best known process for a certain
quad-twist in the U layer at 20 q turns. Table 3 in Winning Ways
gives a 22 q turn process.

The following results should be particularly interesting to
the physical cube solver as it is easier to execute a sequence
of 2 adjacent sides compared to a sequence using 3 or more
sides, which may require some re-orienting of the cube. I will
measure the "face index" of a process by the number of different
sides used in a certain cube sequence. Such a measure could be
used to evaluate the relative elegance of two equally long
processes with respect to their face indices.


Jerry Bryan mentions:
>                         Also, the global maxima are of length 25.
> Does this tell us anything about the Q-turn length of the global

Well, that reminds me of one of the hardest patterns that Dik Winter
tried to find an optimal sequence for:

p141a alternate method   F1 R1 L2 U3 R2 L3 U3 D2 R2 F1 D1 B1 D1 F2 U3
of Superfliptwist + 6 X        R3 D3 F2 D2 L2
**This process was one of the hardest ever to reduce to 20 moves,
requiring  over 19 hours on an SGI R4K Indigo, 28 q turns**

My own $.02 worth is that an antipode for the full group of the 3x3x3
cube is probably deeper than an antipode for the < U, R > group.

I welcome any proposed < U, R > group antipodes. I haven't really
looked for anything exotic like < U, R > positions which are
shift invariant, or even if such a beast is possible!

Of course I already mentioned that...

        U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 = R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2

...but aside from that nothing comes to mind.

Generally when there are elements which occur in both the square's
group AND the < U, R > group the latter is the shorter in q turns.

Notice that using Q+H turns instead of Q turns reduces the maximum
distance from Start from 25 down to 20.

When I first calculated God's Algorithm for <U,R> for Q turns, I calculated
it for cubes first, then for W-conjugate classes.  In this case, I
really did it only for W-conjugate classes (problem is four times
smaller).  The "Number of Cubes" column is then derived by calculating
the size of each W-conjugate class; no real search is needed to
obtain the number of cubes if the W-conjugate classes are already
in hand.

Subject: CFF 34, summary of contents

CFF #34 came out, it ought to have been in June but is a bit late.
Still, the editors expect the next issue in December.

Summary of contents.

Leo Links: On Folding Puzzles.
  A discussion about folding puzzles made from paper or cardboard
  that display a particular figure or text when folded.

Frits Goebel and Bernhard Wiezorke: Problems for Einstein.
  They discuss a puzzle consisting of 8 octonimo's which is marketed
  as IQ CREATOR, MAGIC BLOCK or EINSTEIN PUZZLE.  They show a few
  pretty patterns that can be formed with the 8 pieces.

Vic Stok: Skyline Tetracubes.
  This discusses figures that can be formed from the 8 different
  pieces consisting of 4 cubes glued together.

Jacques Haubrich and Nanco Bordewijk: Cube Chains.
  This discusses a number of puzzles.  Each consists of 27 cubes
  connected to each other by an elastic string.  The objective is
  to form a 3x3x3 cube.

Bernhard Wiezorke: On Nob's L-Puzzle.
  This duscusses Nob's puzzle.  It consists of 10 L shaped pieces,
  3 squares high, 2 squares wide; all in the same orientation, one
  such piece 4 squares high (also the same orientation) and one
  3 square high piece in different orientation (i.e. turned over).
  The objective is to fill a 7x7 square, turnover of the pieces is
  not permitted.

Jacques Haubrich: Pantactic Patterns and Puzzles.
  This discusses an extension of the memory wheel.  On the wheel
  the digits 0 and 1 are written such that when you look at 3
  consecutive digits, all 8 different can be created.  This can
  be generalized to n consecutive digits.  It is well known (since
  N.G. de Bruijn) that 2^n digits are needed.  An 2-dimensional
  extension was made by B. Astle who had a 5x5 square with a
  black-white pattern such that when you look at the 16 different
  2x2 subsquares you will find all 16 different configurations.
  C.J. Bouwkamp made this into a puzzle (in the early 70's) as
  follows: You have 16 2x2 squares with all possible patterns.
  The puzzle is to put them together in a larger square such that
  the borders match.  Rotation is *not* permitted.

Torsten Sillke: Three 3x3 Matching-Puzzles.
  A discussion about three puzzles consisting of 9 squares that
  have to be put in a 3x3 square where some form of marking has
  to match.

Jacques Haubrich: Cube 216.
  The puzzle Gemini consists of 10 pieces where each piece is
  made by joining two 1x2x2 blocks together.  This is done in
  all possible ways.  It is known that there are 50 possible
  ways to pack them in a 4x4x5 block.  Yoshikatsu Hara extended
  this with 22 pieces that form all possible ways to join two
  1x3x3 blocks together.  One result is that there are (at
  least) 11 selections of 12 of these pieces so that they can
  be packed in a 6x6x6 cube in an unique way.  There are more
  results and the author asks also for input.

Chris Roothart: Polylambdas.
  Polylambdas are formed from the 30/60/90 degree triangle.
  Lambdas can be joined at corresponding edges.  Joining
  along the hypothenusa is not allowed.  There are 4 dilambdas,
  4 trilambdas, 11 tetralambdas en 12 pentalambdas.  These 31
  pieces can fill a parallelogram of 4 by 31 units (the short
  leg is the unit).  Many other problems are stated.

Possible Legal Cross Patterns
-----------------------------

Plummer Cross   (6 Cross order 3) =  8 patterns
Christman Cross (6 Cross order 2) =  6 patterns
4 Cross order 2 (sq group)        =  3 patterns
4 Cross order 4                   =  6 patterns
                                    -----------
      14 Six Cross + 9 Four Cross = 23 total legal Cross patterns

There are 0 total cross patterns in the swap orbit

-------------------------
Possible Legal X Patterns
-------------------------

6 X order 3                       =  8 patterns
6 X order 6                       =  8 patterns
6 X order 2 (sq group)            =  1 pattern
4 X order 2 (sq group)            =  3 patterns
2 X order 2 (sq group)            =  3 patterns
                                    -----------
    17 Six X + 3 Four X + 3 Two X = 23 total legal X patterns

For a while I thought that [6 x order 3] combined with the [2 x pattern]
would make a new sort of [6 x order 6], but combining [6 x order 3] with
the [2 x pattern] is essentially the same as combining 6 x order 3 with
the pons asinorum or 6 x order 2.

------------------------------
Possible Swap-Orbit X Patterns
------------------------------

6 X order 2                       =  6 patterns
6 X order 4                       =  6 patterns
4 X order 2                       =  6 patterns
4 X order 4                       =  6 patterns
                                    -----------

             12 Six X + 12 Four X = 24 total swap-orbit X patterns

Some description of the swap-orbit patterns is in order.
The 6 X order 2 pattern has a 2-cycle of opposite edges and
2 sets of 2-cycles of adjacent edges.
The 6 X order 4 pattern has a 2-cycle of opposite edges and
a 4-cycle of edges of adjacent faces.
The 4 X order 2 has 2 sets of 2-cycles of adjacent edges.
The 4 X order 4 has a 4-cycle of edges of adjacent faces.

To make any of these swap-orbit patterns one would have to first
exchange any 2 edge cubies.

Interestingly, a thin line 6 X order 3 is possible on the 5x5x5
cube. No process as yet....

Subject: Shift invariant processes

Mark Longridge wrote in is e-mail message of 1994/04/02

    The resultant position generated by process p8 is invariant under
    shifting, specifically 2 X on the Left and Right sides.

    P8   2 x ORDER 2:

    ...
    7         F2 T2 F2 B2 T2 F2 T2 D2

    This is the longest process I've found so far. Certainly this property
    is not true of all squares group processes. I suspect there are no
    processes in the full group with this property (of any significant
    length). Perhaps the fact that the L and R faces never rotate will
    give some clue on how to generate processes with this property.

I have classified all such shift invariant processes, using a little bit
of group theory and the computer algebra system GAP.

Let me first repeat the definition.
A *process* g_1 g_2 ... g_n, where the letters g_i come from the set
{U,U2,U3,D,D2,D3,...,B,B2,B3}, is called *shift invariant* if each of
the processes g_1 g_2 ... g_n, g_2 ... g_n g_1, ..., g_n g_1 ... g_{n-1}
effects the same element g in the cube group G.

In the following I will be a bit sloppy and neither distinguish between
letters and the corresponding generators of the cube group nor between
processes and the elements of the cube group they effect.
With this terminology a shift invariant processes would be one where
g_1 g_2 ... g_n = g_2 ... g_n g_1 = g_n g_1 ... g_{n-1}.

So lets assume that g = g_1 g_2 ... g_n is a shift invariant process.
Then for every letter g_i in g we have
g_i' g = g_i' (g_i g_{i+1} ... g_{i-1}) = (g_{i+1} ... g_{i-1})
       = (g_{i+1} ... g_{i-1} g_i) g_i' = g g_i'.
That means that g commutes with (the inverses) of each of its letters.

Because g commutes with each of its letters, it also commutes with all
elements of the subgroup H = < g_1, g_2, ..., g_n > generated by its
letters.  The set of those elements of H which commute with all elements
of H is called the centre of H.  Thus g lies in the centre of H.

Obviously the other direction is also true.  If g lies in the centre of
H = < g_1, g_2, ..., g_n >, i.e., if it commutes with every element of H,
then it especially commutes with its letters, and so the corresponding
process is shift invariant.

This says that if we have an element g in the centre of a subgroup
H = < g_1, g_2, ..., g_n >, then *every* process that effects g and
uses the letters g_1, g_2, ..., g_n will be a shift invariant process.

So there are finitely many such elements (after all there are only
finitely many elements in the entire cube group), but each gives
rise to infinitely many different shift invariant processes.
In particular there is *no* longest shift invariant process.

So the task is to search for subgroups H generated by subsets of
{U,U2,U3,D,D2,D3,...,B,B2,B3} that have non-trivial centres.
There are 729 = 3^6 such subgroups.  Of course we are only interested in
representatives under the operation of M (the subgroup of symmetries of
the entire cube), which leaves us with 56 subgroups.

Of those 21 have a non-trivial centre (for this computation I used GAP).
The centres are all very small and contain mostly the same elements,
i.e., the same element lies in the centre of different such subgroups.
I do not want to bore you with the details.  Allow me to jump to the
discussion of the results.

There are 5 different types of elements that give rise to shift invariant
processes.

1)  The ``trivial'' element.
    The identity element lies in the centre of every subgroup H.
    Thus every process that effects the identity is shift invariant.
    There is exactely one such element in the entire group.

2)  The ``central'' element.
    The superflip, which flips all edges, is in the centre of G.
    Thus every process that effects the superflip is shift invariant.
    There is exactely one such element in the entire group.

3)  The ``abelian'' elements.
    The subgroups < U > and < U, D > (and their conjugates under M)
    are abelian, and are therefore equal to their centre.
    Therefore every element in < U > and < U, D > is shift invariant.
    There are 45 such elements in the entire group.

4)  The ``odd'' element.
    The element (UR)^140 lies in the centre of the subgroup <U,R>.
    It is the only shift invariant element of odd order (hence the name).
    Thus this process and its inverse are shift invariant.
    There are 24 such elements in the entire group (two for each edge).

5)  The ``square'' elements.
    The following elements live in the ``square ring'' group <U2,D2,R2,L2>
    (though some of them are central in proper supergroups of it).

5a) The ``single square'' elements.
    The element (U2 R2)^3 lies in the centre of <U2,D,R2,L>.
    Thus this process is shift invariant.
    There are 12 such elements in the entire group (one for each edge).

5b) The ``edge square'' elements.
    The element (U2 R2)^3 (U2 L2)^3 = (D2 R2)^3 (D2 L2)^3
    lies in the centre of <U,D,R2,L2>.
    Thus this process is shift invariant.
    There are 6 such elements in the entire group (two for each axis).

5c) The ``diagonal square'' elements.
    The element (U2 R2)^3 (D2 L2)^3 = (U2 L2)^3 (D2 R2)^3
    lies in the centre of <U2,D2,R2,L2>.
    Thus this process is shift invariant.
    There are 3 such elements in the entire group (one for each axis).

For me the most amazing elements were the ``odd'' element and the
``diagonal square'' element.

They are special in the sense that the smallest subgroup in which they
lie and the largest subgroup in which they are central are equal.
That means that you have no choice which letters to choose to write
them (you have lots of choices how arrange those letters and how often
to repeat them of course).  You cannot use less, because they do not
lie in a smaller group, and you cannot use more, because they are not
central in a larger group.

Let me return to Mark's e-mail and discuss it in the light of the above.

Mark writes

    The resultant position generated by process p8 is invariant under
    shifting, specifically 2 X on the Left and Right sides.

    P8   2 x ORDER 2:

    shift
    0                              D2 F2 T2 F2 B2 T2 F2 T2
    ...

Believe it or not, this is a process for the ``diagonal square'' element.

Mark writes

    This is the longest process I've found so far.

How about (UR)^140 or (UR)^1400?  As mentioned above, you can make the
processes as long as you wish.

Mark writes

    Certainly this property is not true of all squares group processes.

No, only for processes that effect one of the 21 elements mentioned above
(31 if you want to count the ``trivial'' and ``abelian'' elements in the
square group).

Mark writes

    I suspect there are no processes in the full group with this property
    (of any significant length).

Not true.  The interesting ones are the processes effecting the
``central'' element and the ``odd'' elements.

Mark writes

    Perhaps the fact that the L and R faces never rotate will give some
    clue on how to generate processes with this property.

Now this remark makes me very suspicious.  Did Mark know the full story?
The squares subroup has trivial centre (containing only the identity),
you have to leave out at least two generators belonging to opposite
faces, to get a subgroup with non-trivial centre.

Mark writes in another e-mail message of 1994/04/10

    The following processes are also shift invariant:

    2 Swap                   D2 R2 D2 R2 D2 R2 (6)
    (symmetry level 12, SI level 2)

    p21  2 H                 L2 R2 B2 L2 R2 F2 (6)
    (symmetry level 6, SI level 6)

    Amazingly, the process p3 (found using Dik Winter's program) is actually
    a series of 20 processes which all result in the same displacement!

    p3   12 flip             R1 L1 D2 B3 L2 F2 R2 U3 D1 R3 D2 F3 B3 D3 F2 D3
                                R2 U3 F2 D3 (20)
    (symmetry level 1, SI level 20)

The first is obviously a ``single square'' element, the second is a
``edge square'' element, and 'p3' is the ``central'' element.

Thus at this time all non-trivial such elements had been found, except
for the ``odd'' element.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

PS: GAP is really a nice program to analyze the cube group from the
    group-theoretical side, though I would not use it to enumerate
    positions in search for god's algorithm.

PPS: Of course I am biased, because I am one of the main authors of GAP ;-)

What is the record in minutes (or seconds) for the time to solve a rubik's

Do you happen to have any brain teasers or hypothetical questions?

I too, have read the book, Jeff Conquers The Cube in 45 seconds, as well as Minh
Thai's book on the cube (he's the world record holder, with 22 seconds as an
official world record.  I used to compete back in the cubing days, and could
regularly get under 25 seconds, using a strategy of solving the corners,
solving the edges on two opposite sides, followed by the middle slice.

Several people on this mailing list have done serious analysis trying to reach
"God's Algorithm", which isn't terribly useful to me.  The operators that these
analyses generate are really slow to crank out on the cube.  I prefer slightly
longer ones, that are more optimized for speed (hand positions, etc).

I recall a demo on Johnny Carson where a guy solved seven cubes in seven minutes
and I think he had the current world record of around 21 seconds.  I have solved
a cube in 39 seconds but it was luck more than anything else.  When I was play-
ing around with making modifications to my solution to the cube I could solve
any cube in about a minute and a half, which was fast enough to earn me a few
drinks in bars.  I think that a legitimate record would be around 30-45 seconds
and would have to be an average for multiple cubes.

I have been able to solve the Cube in under a minute... but that was 
years ago when my reflexes and memory was better in Junior High... now I 
pull the old cube out for limbering the fingers... and seeing how much I 
remember the solutions... now they are so ingrained in me... I no longer 
remember them as separate moves.... but a conglomeration of twists and 
turns... 

the book --the title I can't remember-- I originally learned from, showed 
the solution as a TOP to BOTTOM approach... doing the first top layer... 
then the center edges... and then completing the last layer...  I noticed 
then Mihn used the top, bottom, middle approach... when he won the 
World's Cube solving championship on the show 'THAT"S INCREDIBLE', which 
was also advocated by the solution book that was available from the 
address that was included with the original cubes...

so then I was able to solve it either way... finding the latter approach 
a little faster...  now the Revenge I can solve in about 5 minutes... 
maybe quicker, but I never really bothered to accurately time myself... I 
only learned the one way to solve the 4x4x4 cube... from Mihn's book.

Now since I joined this mailing list I have been inundated with all these 
algorithms.... how do I translate them?  Being a neophyte to cube 
'theory' its pretty frustrating trying to figure out what all the letters 
and numbers mean... and what they are trying to achieve....

can anyone help?

thanks in advance...

I was thinking of suggesting a few references, but then it occurs that
perhaps there are not very many references currently in print.  Here
is a little Cube Theory 101.

In the "Standard Model" (or maybe the "Singmaster Model") of the 3x3x3
cube, the cube is not rotated in space.  The only thing you can do is
twist one of the six faces.  Singmaster designates the faces as
Up, Down, Right, Left, Front, and Back.  The names are chosen so that
no two of the faces start with the same letter.  There have been some
latter day efforts to rename Up as Top so that all the faces have names
beginning with consonants.

Twists are designated by the first letter of their name  --  U, D, R, L,
F, and B for clockwise quarter-turns; U', D', R', L', F', and B' for
counter-clockwise quarter-turns; U2, D2, R2, L2, F2, and B2 for half-
turns (180 degrees).  In proper typography, the "2" in "U2" is
written as a superscript.  Sometimes U3, D3, etc. are used to denote
counter-clockwise quarter-turns because three clockwise quarter-turns
produce the same result as one counter-clockwise quarter-turn.

A sequence of twists is written left-to-right  -- e.g., FRU'LLR.

The complement notation which is used to convert clockwise quarter-turns
into counter-clockwise quarter-turns may also be applied to a group
of twists  --  e.g., (FRU')' is equal to UR'F' (twisting in the opposite
order and in the opposite direction).

The same sort of notation is used to describe cubies  -- the up-right
cubie is ur.  Singmaster distinguishes between cubies and cubicles
via italic and Roman text, but that is a bit hard to do via E-mail.

Things get a bit more complicated when you consider slice moves,
cubes larger than 3x3x3, and rotations of the whole cube.  Note that
most people solving "real cubes" (as opposed to mathematical
models of cubes) do indeed rotate the whole cube, for example they
move the Bottom face to the Up (or Top), to make it easier to twist.
However, the "Standard Model" does not rotate the whole cube because
mathematically it is just as easy to twist one face as any other.

Hope this helps.

Ooops.  I just pulled out my Frey and Singmaster.  Cubies and cubicles
are both italics, and the distinction is one of upper case italics
vs. lower case italics (still hard to do on E-mail).  Face twists are
Roman (block) letters.  Whole cube rotations are script letters.
Also, in proper typography, a complement (as in R') would normally
be a superscript "-1" rather than an apostrophe.

(By the way, even with a word processor or text processor, I have trouble
with script letters.  I can't get Word Perfect to do script letters, nor
Waterloo Script.  I used to use TeX, and I don't think it could do script
letters.  I haven't tried desk top publishing of the Pagemaker ilk.
Does anybody have any suggestions?  If so, I suspect this is the sort of
thing where private E-mail might be more appropriate than broadcasting
to the entire list.  Thank in advance.)

Yes, this is the main reason for using Top, because of the Rubiksong
introduced by Varga that I described (unfortunately with many typos)
on 22 Feb 90 (<ftp:://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers/cube-mail-6.gz>
is a URL that I hope works--anyone who is actually able to point and
click on this, please let me know).

But there's another reason.  Remember the annoying feature that the
color assignments to faces were never standardized?  The first cube I
bought had red opposite yellow, blue opposite white, and orange
opposite green (I think).  Even though in later days most cubes are
manufactured with opposite faces ``differing by yellow''--red opposite
orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite white--there does not
seem to be a standard for the handedness of the coloring.  This has
long been a problem on cube-lovers, where everyone starts out asking
``I've got my cube solved except a blue sticker on the white face, a
white sticker on the green face, and a green sticker on the blue
face,'' and the puzzle becomes trying to figure out where those faces
are.  (This was fixed in Square 1, where they printed a full-color
instruction book coordinated with the puzzle).

My modest proposal is to define the Standard Earth-Tone Cube, which
has the faces in standard and easily remembered places.  The colors
are taupe, dun, fawn, beige, loam, and roan.  This supports the use of
Top over Up, because ``taupe'' is so much more evocative than
``umber''.  ``Dun'' is also a major win, and I wish I had better names
for the other faces.

I have yet not tried painting such a cube, because I can't figure out
which color is which.

Continuing the previous discussion on shift invariance...

...or (U1 R1)^35 ? And indeed, (U1 R1)^(35 * 40) is shift invariant.
I meant to say (and should have said):

 "This is the longest optimal process I've found so far."

 Although I was inspecting (U1 R1)^N patterns in the quest for shift
invariance, (U1 R1)^35 = (R1 U1)^35 escaped me. In fact it was my
mistaken belief that the < U , R > group had no shift invariant
processes.

 I did not realize the connection between the centre of a group and
shift invariance until Martin's message of Mon Oct 24 17:10:27 1994.
I actually did use GAP on the < U, R > group but I couldn't resolve
the resulting position (can GAP use letters? I should have used
letters).

The missing insight was realizing that, although the full group had
a unique centre, other subgroups have different centres.

So without further adieu:

6 Counterclockwise Twist,
Equivalent to (U1 R1)^35= (R1 U1)^35 & Shift Invariant
UR11 = U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3 U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3
       (22 q  or  20 h  moves)

(U3 R3)^35 would execute a 6 clockwise twist.

Martin writes:

Is this odd due to ( U1 R1 )^35?
Actually everything about the above description appears even.
It is an even number of quarter turns...

Martin writes:

 I concur completely, although the all-commuting 12-flip is definitely
interesting too. I was surprised to see the process was shift invariant.

Martin writes:

For which I refer to the process UR11, 22 q turns.

 Martin, you will be pleased to hear that I like GAP, but I need a
bigger hard drive for that beast!

The "official" world record was set by Minh Thai at the 1982 World
Championships in Budapest Hungary, with a time of 22.95 seconds.

Keep in mind mathematicians provided standardized dislocation patterns
for the cubes to be randomized as much as possible.

I think the Guiness Book of Records dropped the entry in the 1985
edition due to the fact that the contests all dried up.

Interestingly David Allen, the #2 cubist in the United States, also
uses the Jeff Varasano method. I met him in Buffalo NY in the
a regional American Cube-a-thon on Sept 18, 1982. (Yes, that long
ago!)

Did you enter any of the tournaments Derek?

I can't agree entirely. I use computer generated sequences for a lot
of patterns and I find them quite useable in some cases. Also the
< U, R > group processes only use 2 sides, and those I can do
without moving the cube in space. Usually I rotate them in
space first.

Has any analysis of speed cubing been performed in the sense of how
many twists were performed?  How many twists does somebody accomplish
in under 45 seconds or in 22.95 seconds?  For example, you might
video tape somebody and replay it in slow motion.  It would still be
hard to get an accurate count, I think.  You would have to ignore
whole cube rotations, and it might be hard to distinguish between
half and quarter turns, plus somebody might be using slice moves.
But if such an analysis *could* be done, it would be interesting to
to compare the results to what is known mathematically about
God's Algorithm.

I too had wondered this...  and in what way was the solved cube 
'scrambled' for most of you cubists know that all scrambling is not 
equal...  I have found some of my quickest times involved arriving at the 
solution much sooner than expected by not needing to perform some 
auxiliary, but essential and long routines....   Could these world record 
times have been accomplished with random scrambling..... I have always 
pondered how fast I would have completed the cube if I was handed the 
'same' cube that Minh 'flew' on.... A move count would be very 
interesting indeed.... 

With the right equipment and a good copy of the world record video 
tape... it may be conceivable to actually count the moves.... 

In the Hey day of cubing, during a younger version myself, I also found 
by making a good guess at which way to solve the cube (ie.. Top to bottom 
or
top, bottom, then middle) I could easily cut a few seconds off my S.T. 
(solution time)...  but I can't for the life of me remember the 
criteria..

Subject: Re: Shift Invariant Part 2

Mark Longridge writes in his e-mail message of 1994/01/27

    ...or (U1 R1)^35 ? And indeed, (U1 R1)^(35 * 40) is shift invariant.

Mark  kindly points out, that my process (UR)^140 for the ``odd'' element
is a strange choice, given that (UR)^140 = (UR)^35.

I can't recall how I arrived at this process.  Somehow I simply missed
that (UR)^140 = (UR)^35, which is especially strange since I know that
(UR) has order 105 since 1982.

Mark continues

    Equivalent to (U1 R1)^35= (R1 U1)^35 & Shift Invariant
    UR11 = U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3 U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3
           (22 q  or  20 h  moves)

Is UR11 the shortest process effecting the ``odd'' element in <U,R>?

Mark continues

    Is this odd due to ( U1 R1 )^35?
    Actually everything about the above description appears even.
    It is an even number of quarter turns...

The ``odd'' element o has odd order as element of the cube group,
i.e., o^3 = id.  All other shift invariant elements e have even order,
i.e., either e^2 = id or e^4 = id (for some ``abelian'' elements).

Mark continues

    I actually did use GAP on the < U, R > group but I couldn't resolve
    the resulting position (can GAP use letters? I should have used
    letters).

I assume you wonder whether GAP can find a process for a given element.
In fact GAP can do this (you define a homomorphism from the free group
on U,D,L,R,F,B to the cube group and then ask for a preimage of the
element).  But the process is usually extremly long, e.g., for
the ``central'' element GAP finds a process that has length > 2*10^6
(don't try this at home ;-).

There is an improved algorithm by Philip Osterlund, which is a lot
better, but still not good enough to help in the quest for god's
algorithm.  For example it finds a process for the ``central''
element of length 228.

Mark continues

    Martin, you will be pleased to hear that I like GAP,
    but I need a bigger hard drive for that beast!

Look at it this way:
The system costs you $200, and you even get a hard drive for free!

Seriously, you don't need the full distribution (32 MByte),
but only the executable and the library (5 MByte).
However, you should have enough real memory;
8 Mbyte is the minimum, 16 MByte is better,
and the 64 MByte that I have in my workstation don't hurt.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

This is what the archives are for!

Some of you old-timers may have forgotten where the archives are, and it's
been a while (several years) since I reminded everybody about the existence
of Cube-Lovers-Request, so I have included the standard greeting message I
send to all new subscribers below.

Some quick administrative observations while I have your attention:

Today are 151 entries on the main mailing list.  Some of those entries are
local redistribution lists.  I estimate there are about 160 of us.

We celebrated our 14 birthday last July.  I'd bet we are among the top ten
oldest active mailing lists on the Internet.

I periodically get requests for FTP archives of cube-related material other
than our mailing list archives (simulators and other programs, tables of
results, catalogs of merchandise, etc.)  I am not aware of any such
centralized collection of Cubist stuff.  If someone knows of such a
collection, or would like to organize one, or simply has a list of cube
related resources on the network, I'd like to hear from them.

My policy on advertising: Since Cube-Lovers is an unmoderated mailing list,
I really have no control over what is sent here, but I do complain to
people who send advertising that isn't obviously Cube related.  And I
reserve the right to start complaining about -all- advertising should it
ever get out of hand.

Subject:   Speed Cubing Path Lengths

I have received several private E-mail messages indicating that
the algorithms used by speed cubists solve the cube in 50 or
60 moves.  On the one hand, that seems astonishingly good to me,
being fairly close to the solutions from early Thistlethwaite
programs.  On the other hand, it is roughly double (depending, I
suppose on whether H-turns are counted or not) what is probably
the true God's Algorithm.  Hence, it doesn't tell us much about
God's Algorithm except that the speed cubists are very, very
good.

On another subject, my Cube Theory 101 article said that the
apostrophe was used in E-mail to denote complements, when of
course it is used to denote inverses  --  not the same thing
as complements at all.

The best current algorithm has a proven upperbound of 37 turns (q
and h).  God's Algorithm is probably much shorter.  In fact the
program that implements Kociemba's algorithms has not yet found
a configuration (out of many thousands random configurations
tested) that could not be solved in 20 turns or less.  If we look
at distributions for similar puzzles it is expected that more than
one in three configurations requires the maximum number of turns
minus 1 or 2.  So I expect God's Algorithm to be at most 22 turns.
Still a long way to go.

Is there a program that allows you to type in Singmaster-style
moves and then prints out the resultant state, something like
this (not actual results):

INPUT:   (R U2 R3 U2)2
OUTPUT:  (fur,drb,rdf) (fr,dr)

This is what I tried to write long ago, but I never had all
the tricks needed to get the program to work.

If no program like this exists, is there something similar?
I guess I would be looking for nicely-portable C or a DOS
binary.  Thanks to you all for sharing cube information.

Subject: The real size of cube space

In January of this year, Jerry Bryan and I wrote of counting the
number of M-conjugacy classes of Rubik's cube.  In the sense that (for
instance) there is really only one position 1 QT from start, even
though that QT may be applied in twelve different ways, this task
amounts to counting the true number of positions of the cube.  The
earlier discussion centered on calculations involving computer
analysis of large numbers of positions.  However, a look in Paul B.
Yale's book _Geometry and Symmetry_ gave me a clue: the Polya-Burnside
theorem is a tool that allows us to perform this calculation by hand.

The Polya-Burnside theorem describes a relation between a finite group
J and a _representation_ of the group.  For our purposes, a represen-
tation is a homomorphism of J into a permutation group, R: J -> S[X].
Here, S[X] refers to the group of all permutations of a set X; the
image of J, called R(J), need not be the whole of S[X], but R(J) will
be a subgroup of S[X].  The _orbits_ of R(J) are the equivalence
classes of X under the relation x~y, said to be true if there is some
permutation p in R(J) for which p(x)=y.  The _fixed points_ of a
permutation p in R(J) are the elements x of X for which p(x)=x.  The
Polya-Burnside theorem states that the average number of fixed points
of permutations in R(J) is equal to the number of orbits of R(J).
That is,
         |R(J)| |Orbits(R(J))| = Sum[p in R(J)] |FixedPoints(p)|.
The average may also be taken over J:
            |J| |Orbits(R(J))| = Sum[j in J] |FixedPoints(R(j))|,
a nontrivial distinction, since R may not be one-to-one (though it is
for our application).  The Polya-Burnside theorem is not very
inaccessible nor hard to prove, but I will not prove it here.

For our purpose, we take the group J to be M, the 48-element group of
symmetries of the cube.  X will be the set of all cube positions,
which we usually call Gx (for GE, GC, or G, depending on whether we
consider edges, corners, or both; we are considering the positions
relative to fixed face centers in all three cases).  And the repre-
sentation R is the operation of M-conjugation: (R(m))(g) = m' g m.
Verifying that R is a homomorphism is an exercise in associativity
that Jim Saxe and I carried out in the Symmetry and Local Maxima
paper, in the archives [cube-mail-1, 14 December 1980].

R has been so chosen because we wish to calculate the number of
M-conjugacy classes of Gx, |Gx\Conj(M)|, which is be the number of
orbits of R(M).  To apply the Polya-Burnside theorem for this, we need
to calculate, for each element of m of M, the number of fixed points
of R(m).  That is the number of elements g of Gx for which m' g m = g.
Multiplying by m, this becomes g m = m g: the fixed points we wish to
count are just those elements g of Gx that commute with m.

There are several tools to make the counting easier.  First, I'll note
that just as there are M-conjugacy classes of Gx, there are
M-conjugacy classes of M itself.  The number of fixed points of R(m)
is the same for any m in a given conjugacy class.  So to calculate the
total number of fixed points over R(M), we need only calculate the
number of g in Gx commuting with each of the ten classes of cube
symmetry and multiply by the size of the class.

The fundamental principle we use in finding whether g commutes with m
can be found by examining the cycles of m.  Suppose m permutes a cycle
(c1,c2,...,ck), so that c2=m(c1), c3=m(c2),...,ck=m(c[k-1]),c1=m(ck).
For g to commute with m, we have g(c2)=m(g(c1)), g(c3)=m(g(c2)), ...,
g(ck)=m(g(c[k-1]), and g(c1)=m(g(ck)).  So (g(c1),g(c2),...,g(ck)) is
also a cycle of m.  Thus g must map each k-cycle of m to another
k-cycle of m, and in the same order.  Conversely, if g acts thus on
cycles, then g will commute with m, and so g is a fixed point of R(m).

Suppose that m has j different k-cycles of cubies.  There are j! k^j
possibilities for g's action on the cubies in those k-cycles: j!
permutations of cycles, and for each g:(c1,c2,...,ck)->(d1,d2,...,dk),
k choices for g(c1) among {d1,...,dk}.  It turns out to be a fairly
easy exercise to show that half of those possibilities are even
permutations and half odd, though the partition by parity is
surprisingly different depending on whether k is even or odd.  This
will allow us to combine the results for GE and GC simply by
multiplying together and dividing by two.

Now consider orientation of cubies.  This is similar to the case of
permutation, in that the orientation that g imposes on a cubie is a
constant for all cubies in a cycle.  I will first discuss the edge
orientation, which is fairly straightforward, and continue to corner
orientation, which has some surprising features.

For edge orientation, if all the cycles have even length, then g's
orientation parity is zero over each cycle, and so zero over the
entire cube.  So we can choose the orientation of imposed by c1->g(c1)
for each cycle (c1,...,ck) in 2^j ways.  If there are odd-length
cycles, then half of the orientations will have nonzero orientation
parity, and only 2^(j-1) possible orientations can be achieved.

For corners, we might expect there to be 3^(j-1) orientations, except
3^j for cycles of length a multiple of three, and this is often so.
But there are two important exceptions.  First, if m is a reflection
(i.e., not a proper rotation in C) then alternate cubies in each cycle
must be given the opposite orientation by g.  If the cycle has even
length, this conserves orientation, so there will be 3^j possibili-
ties.  If the cycle has odd length, this implies that the orientation
of each cubie must be its own opposite (i.e., zero twist).  Thus,
there there is only one possible orientation of the 1-cycles in the
diagonal reflections.  The second exception, an even bigger surprise,
occurs when m is either the 120-degree rotation or the 60-degree in-
verted rotation.  It turns out that the orientation constraint forbids
any permutation that exchanges the two 1-cycles in these positions.
(This constraint on permutations would throw off the equality between
even and odd permutations, except that these classes of m have other
corner cycles that restore the balance.)  The impossibility of m
commuting with an exchange of the two corners can be verified by
examining the possible orientations, but I haven't got any good way of
characterizing when it would be be a problem in general.  In fact, I
did not notice it until I investigated discrepancies with the
exhaustive computer analysis.

Using the above analysis, we may carry out the calculation as in the
three tables below.  The first two tables count the number of fixed
points of R(m) for an element m of each class, multiply by the class
size, and divide by |J|=48 to get the number of orbits as in the
Polya-Burnside theorem.  The third table calculates the number of
fixed points by combining the results of the first two tables, divided
by the class size (which was multiplied in both for edges and for
corners), and divided by 2 (because only half the combined positions
have matching permutation parity).

Even more thoughts on "Shift Invariance"

Martin asks:
>Is UR11 the shortest process effecting the ``odd'' element in <U,R>?

After a bit of computer cubing I found:

p183 6 Twist      R1 U3 R2 U3 R1 D3 U3 R1 U3 R3 D2 R3 U3 R1 D3 U3
                  (18 q  or  16 h  moves)

 This requires using the larger group of <U1, R1, D1>, although I
expected a 16 turn process. Note the fact this larger group has face
index 3 (rather than 2). But now the process is NOT shift invariant
and we see the route itself can determine whether it will be
shift invariant!

I welcome any mathematical explanation!

With even more contemplation I noticed that the process for
 the edge 3-cycle

UR1 = U3 R1 U2 (R1 U1)^2 R2 U3 R3 U3 R2 U1     (16 q, 13 h)

...was reducible to

UR1a= F1 U2 (F1 U1)^2 F2 U3 F3 U3 F2           (14 q, 11 h)]

Of course, now we are using <U1, F1> rather than <U1, R1>.

This is not a shift invariance question, but rather two
questions about your searches.  One question is, do you perform separate
searches for q-turns and h-turns, or only for h-turns?  The reason I
ask is the obvious fact that optimal processes in q-turns need not
contain h-turns.  The second question is, how on earth do you keep track
of all those processes in your searches?  I have been asked how I search
so many positions.  I have answered the question before, but I guess
another part of the answer that I haven't mentioned is that I don't
keep up with processes at all, only positions.  If I am asked to provide
processes, I can do so, but it is a very painful task.  I have thought
about keeping up with processes, but I am quite sure that if I did
so it would reduce the number of positions I could search.

    I welcome any mathematical explanation!

As I tried to explain in my first e-mail message, a shift invariant
process is a process in a subgroup X of G corresponding to an element
x in the centre *of this subgroup*.

The ``odd'' element is an element in the centre of the subgroup < U, R >.
Thus any process effecting this element written in U and R is a shift
invariant process.  UR11 is one such process.

However, the ``odd'' element does not lie in the centre of the subgroup
< U, R, D > (in fact this subgroup has trivial centre).  Thus a process
effecting this element *involving D*, will *not* be shift invariant.

Some shift invariant processes are in fact in the centre of multiple
subgroups.  For example the square elements, except for the ``diagonal
square'' element, have this property.

For such elements one has some choice which generators to use.  For
example the ``single square'' elements (U2 R2)^3 lies in the centre of
< U2, R2 > and < U2, D, R2, L > (and all subgroups inbetween), so every
process effecting this element involving any subset of U2, D, D2, R2, L,
and L2, will be a shift invariant process.

For the ``odd'' element, one has now choice.  It lies in the centre of
< U, R >, but not in the centre of any larger group.  Thus a shift
invariant process effecting the ``odd'' element must involve U and R,
and cannot involve more generators.

Subject: Re: The real size of cube space

Dan Hoey writes in his e-mail message of 1994/11/04

    In January of this year, Jerry Bryan and I wrote of counting the
    number of M-conjugacy classes of Rubik's cube.  In the sense that (for
    instance) there is really only one position 1 QT from start, even
    though that QT may be applied in twelve different ways, this task
    amounts to counting the true number of positions of the cube.  The
    earlier discussion centered on calculations involving computer
    analysis of large numbers of positions.  However, a look in Paul B.
    Yale's book _Geometry and Symmetry_ gave me a clue: the Polya-Burnside
    theorem is a tool that allows us to perform this calculation by hand.

    ...a very nice application of the Polya-Burnside theorem,
       to compute the number of M-conjugacy classes in G...

Yes, a little bit of group theory can answer many questions arising from
the cube.  In fact I have noticed that quite a few of well known results
in group theory have been rediscovered in this forum.  Note that I don't
think this is a bad thing.  At least for me results that I ``knew'' are
now, that they have been demonstrated for the cube, much easier to grasp
than they were before (grasp is certainly an appropriate term in
connection with the cube).

Dan continues

    For our purpose, we take the group J to be M, the 48-element group of
    symmetries of the cube.  X will be the set of all cube positions,
    which we usually call Gx (for GE, GC, or G, depending on whether we
    consider edges, corners, or both; we are considering the positions
    relative to fixed face centers in all three cases).  And the repre-
    sentation R is the operation of M-conjugation: (R(m))(g) = m' g m.
    Verifying that R is a homomorphism is an exercise in associativity
    that Jim Saxe and I carried out in the Symmetry and Local Maxima
    paper, in the archives [cube-mail-1, 14 December 1980].

The way I view this is as follows.  The entire cube group C is a
permutation group group on 6*9 points, generated by the six face turns U,
D, L, R, F, B; the three middle slice turns M_U, M_L, M_F; and the
reflection S.  This group has a subgroup M of symmetries of the cube (of
order 48), generated by U M_U D', L M_L R', F M_F B', and S.  Another
subgroup is G, generated by the six face turns, which has index 48 in G.
G is a normal divisor of C, G is the semidirect product of M and G.  The
same is true for GE and GC.

Obviously M operates by conjugation on G, and this implies that the
mapping R is a homomorphisms.

Another way to say this is that M is a subgroup of the outer autmorphism
group of G (which in this case can be easily represented as a supplement
of G).  Note that the elements of M are also a autmorphisms of the Cayley
graph.  That means that elements of M respects the length of operations.
That is if g_1 and g_2 are elements of G that are in one conjugacy class
under M, then the lenght of the shortest process effecting them is equal.
This follows from the fact that M fixes the set of the generators of G
and their inverses.  M is fact the largest subgroup of the outer
autmorphism group with this property, which makes it rather important.

Dan continues

    R has been so chosen because we wish to calculate the number of
    M-conjugacy classes of Gx, |Gx\Conj(M)|, which is be the number of
    orbits of R(M).  To apply the Polya-Burnside theorem for this, we need
    to calculate, for each element of m of M, the number of fixed points
    of R(m).  That is the number of elements g of Gx for which m' g m = g.
    Multiplying by m, this becomes g m = m g: the fixed points we wish to
    count are just those elements g of Gx that commute with m.

This set is called the *centralizer* of m in Gx.  Usually the centralizer
in a group X is only defined for elements in X, but it is obvious how to
extend this definition.

Dan continues

    The fundamental principle we use in finding whether g commutes with m
    can be found by examining the cycles of m.  Suppose m permutes a cycle
    (c1,c2,...,ck), so that c2=m(c1), c3=m(c2),...,ck=m(c[k-1]),c1=m(ck).
    ...nice discussion of what must happen to cycles if two
       permutations commute...

This can be used directly to compute the centralizer of an element in the
full symmetric group.  Since G's structure is very similar to a symmetric
group (or more accurately the direct product of two symmetric groups), it
allows to describe the centralizer of an element in G.  The more a group
differs from a symmetric group the less this analysis helps (for those
that know what I'm talking about: the more a group differs from the
symmetric group, the worse a backtrack computation using cycle structure
analysis is).

Minor typo.  You don't mean ``Corner times edge / (96 * class size)'' but
``Corner times edge / 96 * class size'', which is in fact what you
computed for the following table.

Wow, I didn't realize this sort of calculation had been automated.

Martin.Schoenert@math.rwth-aachen.de writes:

    The way I view this is as follows.  The entire cube group C is a
    permutation group group on 6*9 points, generated by the six face
    turns U, D, L, R, F, B; the three middle slice turns M_U, M_L,
    M_F; and the reflection S.  This group has a subgroup M of
    symmetries of the cube (of order 48), generated by U M_U D',
    L M_L R', F M_F B', and S.  Another subgroup is G, generated by
    the six face turns, which has index 48 in G.  G is a normal
                                              ^
    divisor of C, G is the semidirect product of M and G.  The same is
                  ^
    true for GE and GC.

I think two of those G's are supposed to be C's, right?  What is the
difference between a direct product and a semidirect product?

    ... [conjugation by] M fixes the set of the generators of G and
    their inverses.  M is fact the largest subgroup of the outer
    autmorphism group with this property, which makes it rather
    important.

In a 1983 Cubic Circular article (of which I know only Stan Isaacs's
summary) David Singmaster observed that the group is larger for larger
cubes, provided we work what I call the ``theoretical invisible
group''.  That is, we solve not only the surface of the cube, but the
hypothetical interior (n-2)^3 cube, and all the smaller (n-2k)^3 cubes
as well.  I blithered at length about this in my article of 1 June
1983 archived (I think I've got it right this time) at
<ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers/cube-mail-5.gz>.

The idea is that a mapping called evisceration allows us to permute
the layers of the cube.  On the 4x4x4 cube, this for instance allows
us to exchange each inner slab with its adjacent outer slab.  It also
allows us to conjugate each inner slab move by central inversion,
while leaving the outer slab moves alone.  In general, evisceration of
a d-dimensional cube by f maps each feature (cubie, colortab, or
face-center arrow) at coordinates (x[1],x[2],...,x[d]) to
(f(x[1]),f(x[2]),...,f(x[d])), where f is a permutation of the
intervals between the cleavage coordinates of the cube.  I believe
that if f commutes with the central inversion, then conjugation by
evisceration is an outer automorphism of the Rubik's cube group.  (I
think I have proved this for d=3, and I think the proof in higher
dimensions should not be difficult given the right notation.)

The group of all eviscerations includes the central inversion; we can
of course augment it by the rotation group in d-space.  Is this the
maximum outer automorphism group that respects generators of the
Rubik's cube?  For this we take the generators to be turns of slabs
between adjacent cleavage planes.  (Turns are direct d-1-dimensional
isometries.)

I was already familiar with this augmented symmetry group because it
also induces automorphisms on d-dimensional tic-tac-toe.  (In fact, it
may be the maximal automorphism group on all tic-tac-toe boards of
side greater than two.  I know it's been proven for 4^3, but I don't
know of any larger results).  Do you know anything more about this
group, like whether it has been named or studied?

    Since G's structure is very similar to a symmetric group (or more
    accurately the direct product of two symmetric groups), it allows
    to describe the centralizer of an element in G.  The more a group
    differs from a symmetric group the less this analysis helps (for
    those that know what I'm talking about: the more a group differs
    from the symmetric group, the worse a backtrack computation using
    cycle structure analysis is).

But no, G's structure is actually similar to the direct product of two
_wreathed_ symmetric groups.  Does this interfere with the
backtracking as much as it interferes with my manual analysis?  Do you
know of any good treatments of finding centralizers of outer
automorphisms of wreath products?  In particular, I would very much
like to know under what conditions the centralizer of the wreath
product fails to cover the centralizer of the permutation factor, as
we saw with the corners.

As for when I wrote

    M class             Edge         Corner       Corner times edge
      (class size)      F.P.          F.P.             / (96*class size)
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That's not a typo.  I was just saying that column 4 is equal to column
2 times column 3, divided by column 1, divided by 96.  Perhaps I
should have factored column 1 out of columns 2 and 3 first to avoid
this confusion.

    gap-3.4 -b -g 4m 
    gap> Sum( ConjugacyClasses( M ),
    >         c -> Size( Centralizer(G,Representative(c)) ) / 48 * Size(c) );
    901083404981813616

Well, call me John Henry.  Say, do you have gap libraries for other
magic polyhedra?  For higher-dimensional magic?

I have discussed a similar view of things recently, except that I was
not brave enough to include a reflection in the generators.  C is
normally used to denote the set of twenty-four rotations of the
cube (a sub-group of M), so let's call your "entire cube group"
big_G instead.  My version of big_G was generated by Q plus the
slice moves (like yours without the reflection), or alternatively
by Q plus C.  Your version of big_G is hence the same as the one
I discussed except that you added a reflection.  C (the rotations C,
that is) is a sub-group of both versions of big_G.  M is a sub-group
of your version of big_G, but not of mine.

Your big_G has the obvious advantage of including M as a sub-group.
Mine has the advantage (?) of being physically realizable on a
real cube.  That is, for X in your big_G, rX or Xr (r is a reflection)
is also in your big_G.  For X in my big_G, rX or Xr is not in
big_G, and correspondingly a single reflection is not physically
realizable on a real cube.  Of course, r'Xr is in big_G in either
case, r being in M.  Also, cX and Xc are in either version of big_G
for all c in C.

I tend to think that Singmaster's standard G=<Q> is not what people
think of when they hold a real cube in their hand.  Rather, they
tend to think of big_G/C.  That is, the cosets of C in big_G are
common sensically considered to be equivalent because rotating
a real cube in space is "doing nothing".  Also, for my version
of big_G we have |big_G/C| = |G|.

For either version of big_G, we have to re-interpret
parity arguments slightly.  In Singmaster's G=<Q>, we say that
even corners occur only with even edges and vice versa.  In
big_G, a face quarter-turn is odd on the corners and edges, and
a slice quarter-turn is odd on the edges and on the centers.
Hence, you can have odd corners with even edges and vice versa,
but only if the centers are simultaneously odd.  Therefore, the
rules concerning which configurations of edges and corners can
occur together are really preserved, even in big_G.

Finally, neither version of big_G is as big as you can go.  That is,
neither of them includes Singmaster's Supergroup, where different
orientations of the otherwise fixed face centers are considered.
Also, neither one of them considers Dan Hoey's Eccentric Slabism,
wherein invisible inner cubes are considered.

This of course is the basis for the large searches I have been able
to perform using M-conjugate classes.  The only trouble is, I don't
even know what a Cayley graph is (but I am working on it), the last
course I took in group theory being 25 years ago.

Subject: Re: Is there a symbolic cube program?

In response to my request for a algebraic cube simulator,
I have found out about the following:

  Rubik Algebra, a $10 shareware DOS program that displays
   a color picture of the cube on the left and a list
   of choices (rotate a face, library of moves, scramble)
   on the right.  It accepts a text string of moves
   similar to Singmaster notation and displays the
   resulting cube in 3D.  There is an option that will
   tell you the cycle decomposition of the current
   state.  So, this program provides the function I
   requested and I will have to play with it to see
   if the graphical cube and menus make this too hard
   to use.  Nonetheless, my brief trial of the program
   suggests that this is a good, straightforward tool
   to fiddle with and analyze the cube.  This was
   mentioned by Warut Roonguthai <kamala@chulkn.chula.ac.th>.

  Maple and X-Maple were suggested as symbolic algebra
   programs that could handle this type of task, but
   I have no further understanding of these to know
   how slick they would be.  This was mentioned by
   Brett Stevens <brett@math.toronto.edu>.  There are
   surely other symbolic algebra programs, but I don't
   know of them.

  Roll-your-own, the approach I (we all?) should use.
   I think we could build a suite of text-based tools
   written in "standard" portable C, that allows for:
     - input of move sequences
     - display of cyclical decomposition
     - definition of compound moves that can be
        used just like a standard move
     - one-shot execution from the commandline or
        running move mode
     - find solution(s) from current state
     - randomize/scramble
     - other analysis of current state, like some
        of the mathematics and numbers that have
        been discussed in this newsgroup
     - other size and shape cubes?
   If folks want to do this, then I suggest that the
   eager and capable coders who dive in first ought
   to try real hard to make a system that can be
   driven from other programs (such as a windowing
   GUI display program with graphical cube).  If for
   example the current state of the cube was stored
   in a file current.cub, then a program called cube
   could be called like "cube r2u3r2u" or "cube r2xr2"
   where 'x' is a defined move--defined by
   "cube define x rfr3f3" and that got stored in
   a file library.cub.  The other functions could be
   separate programs (which read the same files):
      cubehome
      cuberand
      cubesolv
   If I wrote this, I would have a hard time using
   C instead of REXX.

In the absence of finding exactly what I want, I
will be experimenting with Rubik Algebra and deciding
whether I ought to start writing something like the
roll-your-own described above.

Reply to this group if you know anything more.  Thanks.
Thanks for the pointers to this information and the
encouragement to give it a shot myself.  Maybe this would
be a good task for my holidays and my little remaining
vacation.  If I do something, I'll let you know.

I have a symbolic cube program, which I didn't write (written by
raymond@cps.msu.edu).  It does pretty much what you want, although I'm
not too sure how portable it is.  It was written in C, using yacc and flex (lex
doesn't work on it tho, go figure.)

I could post it to the group, or send it to individuals that wanted it.

The cube lovers archives contain over two megabytes of readable
discussions on the cube.  In the interests of keeping them readable, I
ask that binary files and programs be distributed using some other
channel: private email, ftp, web, or whatever.  Please let Cube-Lovers
remain a _discussion_ list for cube topics.

I am aware that alternative distribution methods are not supplied
by Alan Bawden in his maintenance of the Cube-Lovers list and
archives.  Please consider that encouragement to provide such
methods, rather than an excuse to use this list for the purpose.

I am also aware that the recent program was not much larger than some
of the discussion articles on the list.  Nonetheless, it does not
contribute to the discussion, and imposes a burden on those of us who
subscribe for the discussion.  The revised versions and larger
programs to follow would impose a growing burden on the list.

Jerry asks, in his message of Sun, 6 Nov 1994 09:15:37 (EST):

>This is not a shift invariance question, but rather two
>questions about your searches.  One question is, do you perform
>separate searches for q-turns and h-turns, or only for h-turns?

The <U, R> group searches are q-turns only, but if I see a way to
compress it a bit by eye I do so. For example:

UR2 = U3 R3 U3 R2 U1 R1 U1 R3 U3 R1 U1 (R1 U3)^2 R3 U3

...was reduced to

UR2 = U2 R3 U3 R2 U1 R1 U1 R3 U3 R1 U1 (R1 U3)^2 R3

> The second question is, how on earth do you keep track
> of all those processes in your searches?

 With the computer hardware I'm using (486-DX40 with 4 megs) and
my current algorithm I created a file "ur.dat" which is a flat
ascii file. It contains all the processes which generate distinct
positions up to 12 q turns. I also have the file "ursum.is" which
contains all the `cubesums' for each element of <U, R>.

 My program "x3bin.exe" loads the "ursum.is" database into memory
and it does a binary search on the cubesums to try and find a
match for the current position. If not found, it turns the
current cube and tries again, with longer and longer sequences
until a match is found.

 Using this method I have found a process for all <U, R> positions
with the longest being 22 q turns (so far). The hardest positions
can take as long as a couple of hours. I have no idea what the
antipodes look like at this time, but I'll probably try the
random approach soon.


Jerry continues:

>p183 6 Twist      R1 U3 R2 U3 R1 D3 U3 R1 U3 R3 D2 R3 U3 R1 D3 U3
>                  (18 q  or  16 h  moves)
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This process was found using the Kociemba algorithm in a program
written by Dik Winter, which I ran on a Sun4. This program uses
h turns in it's searches and uses all 6 generators.

 After inspecting the original process found by the program,
I was able to manually reduce it somewhat, resulting in p183 above.

The original process....

Solution (13+ 4=17): R1 U1 D1 R3 U1 R1 D2 R1 U1 R3 U1 D1 R3 U1 R2 U1 R2
That is (or as Dan would say i.e.) 13 h turns in phase 1 and 4 turns
in phase 2. Hmmm, looks like I used the inverse of the original.


Jerry Continues:

 Well, that explains the fact you counted the number of antipodes but
had no processes for them, but do you know what they look like?
If you can tell me what one of the 87 positions at 25 q turns
looks like, I should be able to generate a sequence for it.

The 87 positions correspond to 27 antipodes which are
unique up to W-conjugacy.  Here they are:

I have considered keeping a file of processes, either in parallel
with my file of positions, or together in the same file.  However,
I have always rejected the idea because it would take too much
storage for the very large searches I want to accomplish.
Also, since I only store representative elements of equivalent
classes in my data base, it is hard to know what a "process"
means (see below).

Interesting approach, and very different than what I do.  I simply
do a "game theory" type tree search of positions (*not* processes)
with Start at the root of the tree.  I have to search the whole
depth of the tree rather than half the depth of the tree, as you do.
(I could obviously verify the depth of one particular position with
two half-depth searches, but I confess I have never been very
interested in "particular positions".  I want to search the whole
tree.)

I tend to think of the processing required for whole tree searches
as "global" because you cannot determine anything about
one particular position except in the context of the other
positions down to the same level of the tree.  By contrast, there
is some interesting processing that you can do that is "local";
e.g.,  conjugate class sizes, symmetry group determination, etc.
can be determined on a position by position basis without
regard to any other position.  Such "local" processing is generally
much easier than the "global" processing.  "Local" processing
is O( N ) and requires essentially no memory. "Global" processing
is O( N log(N) ) if you are efficient, maybe O(N^2) if you are not,
and is very consumptive of memory.  As I have said before, I solve
the memory problem by externalizing the data to files and sorting
the files.

Saying that I have a hard time converting positions into processes
doesn't mean that I cannot do so.  The process for a given position
can be extracted from a data base of positions by backtracking
from the position back to Start.  However, I have two difficulties.

One is that I store only representative elements of equivalence
classes (of the form {m'Xmc} for centerless cubes, or M-conjugate
classes of the form {m'Xm} for cubes with centers)}.  That means
that as you backtrack, the process you are determining (backwards)
will rotate and reflect out from under you.  For example, suppose we
have Repr{m'Xm}=f'Xf for some fixed f in M.  If Xq for some q in Q
is a neighbor of X which is one move closer to Start than X,
then we might have Repr{m'(Xq)m}=g'(Xq)g for some fixed g in M.
But f and g need not be, and usually aren't, the same.

It might be noted in passing that there is duality between the
symmetry of a position X and a process P=p1 p2 ... pn which produces
X.  That is, if f is a fixed element of M, then we have
f'Xf = f'Pf = f'(p1)f f'(p2)f ... f'(pn)f.

The second problem is that my files are so large that I have to
keep them on magnetic tape.  If I need to find a process, I first
find a sequence of positions (really, a sequence of representative
elements) on the tapes (hard to search tapes!), and copy the
positions to a small disk file.  From that point, it is not
especially hard to run a program to display the positions in
sequence and determine the process.

Subject: SYMBOLIC PROGRAMS

I couldn't quickly get a LEX or FLEX working to process the source
of the symbolic cube program written by Carl Raymond
(raymond@cps.msu.edu).  Carl's note said "do what you want...",
so, I did.

I managed to convert his C-and-LEX cube program into REXX.  You
type in a move sequence and it displays the resulting cycle
structure.  Exactly what I have always wanted.  I am still
testing it and working the bugs out, but now I can return to
my "cube research" (that is, playing around).

If anyone else needs such a straightforward text-mode cube program
in REXX (instead of C), let me know and I will share it with you...
after a little more testing.  (Contact me directly, not in this
group.)  Interpreted REXX is built in on OS/2, VM, MVS, and is
available (somewhere) for Unix systems, Amiga, and probably others.

A million thanks to Carl.

 With Jerry's help I have found a process for one of the <U, R>
antipodes! Note the number of turns required in the h turn metric.
I applied the turn R1 to the position so the program only needed to
search 24 q turns deep.


First Antipodal Process    (25 q, 20 q)
UR13 = U2 R1 U3 R2 U3 R2 U3 R1 U2 R3 U1 R3 U3 R1 U1 R2 U1 R3 U1 R3

Also....      UR13 ^ 2 = I

Using current techniques, this required a run of about 11 hours.

 It remains to be seen how the Kociemba algorithm resolves this
position, and I will try this next.

 Although somewhat unrelated, I found a square's group process
for 6 X order 2 (the pons asinorum) by hand, which does
not move the centres:

                U2 B2 L2 U2 D2 L2 F2 T2
                F2 U2 L2 F2 B2 L2 D2 F2   (16 h, 32 q)

Of the 54 antipodes under Q+H processing, only
16 are unique up to W-conjugacy, with all 16 antipodes being
20 q+h moves from Start.  Also, there is only one cube position which
is both one of the 27 antipodes under Q (25 moves from Start) and also one
of the 16 antipodes under Q+H (20 moves from Start).

Just for completeness, here are the 16 Q+H antipodes.

You mean: F2 U3 D2 L3 D3 R1 U2 B2 R1 B2 R3 D1 L1 D3 R2 U1 D3 (or rather
its inverse)?  Took Kociemba's algorithm 10 minutes.  I do not yet

Are you applying Kociemba's algorithm to the <U,R> antipodal positions
in the context of <U,R> or in the context of G?  The lengths of these
antipodal positions are already known to be minimal in <U,R>.
However (and obviously), the length in <U,R> can only be claimed to
be an upper bound for the length in G without further testing in G.

In the context of G.  I have no idea what Kociemba's algorithm in the
context of <U,R> should be; hence my question.

I guess the most limited definition is two points on the opposite sides
of a sphere, at the ends of a diameter  -- e.g., the north pole and
the south pole.  However, the definition need not be limited to
three dimensions (points on the opposite ends of a diameter of a
circle are sometimes referred to as antipodes, I think) nor to
circles and spheres (I have seen opposite corners of a square
referred to as antipodes).

Generalizing further, antipodes are "opposite" or "maximally distant"
points of any sort of structure, depending on what "opposite" or
"maximally distant" mean in the context at hand.  With respect to
Rubik's cube, antipodes of Start are states which are maximally
distant from Start, and it is a matter of great interest what that
maximal distance might be.

I have to admit to a certain discomforture with one aspect of the way
we tend to refer to antipodes in the Rubik's cube.  Most Rubik
structures that have been investigated do not have a single point which
is maximally distant from Start; rather, they have several or many
maximally distant points, and all the maximally distant points are
called antipodes.  I would be more comfortable using "antipode" only
when the maximally distant point is unique.  One example where the
maximally distant point is unique is the subgroup consisting of
edges only (no corners or centers) where only Q-turns are allowed.
In this case, the maximally distant point has been called the
"unique antipode".  The description "unique antipode" seems
redundant somehow  --  "antipode" ought to imply "unique", but that
has not been the custom on Cube-Lovers.

Subject:   <U,R> Q vs. Q+H Distances from Start

The fact that there is only one position in <U,R> which is antipodal
for both Q moves and Q+H moves got me to thinking more generally about
the Q distance from Start as compared to the Q+H distance from Start
for any position.  Here follows a cross-tabulation table giving the
number of positions in <U,R> unique up to W-conjugacy which are m moves
from Start under Q and n moves from Start under Q+H.

The table has some interesting features.  The main diagonal contains
powers of 2 for distances from zero to nine.  Other entries in the
upper left portion of the table (close to Start) are often small
primes times powers of 2.  There are positions where allowing Q+H
moves saves nine moves (from nineteen down to ten), which is a
substantial savings in moves.  There is one "discontinuity" in the
table; a position which is 25 moves from Start under Q may be 20,
19, 18, 17, or 15 moves from Start under Q+H, but not 16 moves from
Start.  The longest "common distance" is nineteen;  there are
positions which are nineteen moves from Start under both Q and Q+H,
but for twenty moves and above there are no positions which are
a common distance from Start.

This is the same chart as before except that it is in terms of all
cube positions in <U,R> rather than in terms of W-conjugacy classes.

At the same time, I will take the opportunity to correct an error
in the previous posting.  Permitting Q+H moves rather than just
Q moves can save up to 10 moves (e.g., 25 moves with Q and 15 moves
with Q+H, 24 moves with Q and 14 moves with Q+H, and 22 moves with
Q and 12 moves with Q+H).  My thanks to Dan Hoey for spotting this error.

Subject:   Antipodes Revisited

I received the following from David Singmaster, forwarded with
permission.

>        I thought I remembered that antipodes is actually singular!  In fact
>it is singular in Greek but English recognizes both antipodes and antipode.
>But the Antipodes means the region on the earth opposite to where one is and
>is construed as a plural though its sense is singular.  So antipodes is
>actually not too bad a word for all the points which are maximally far away
>and antipode should be reserved for the case where there is a unique
>maximally distant point.

Prior to my first post on this subject, I consulted a mathematics
dictionary.  This time, I consulted an English dictionary as well.
It indicates that "antipode" is a back formation from the Greek
"antipodes", and that the pronunciation is anglicized as "AN-ti-POHD".
There is a separate entry for "antipodes". (It seems unusual for a
dictionary to have a separate entry for a plural form.)  The plural
pronunciation retains its Greek form as "an-TIP-uh-DEEZ".

Subject: Group Slang in Cube Lovers

Dan Hoey and Jerry Bryan remind me, that not everybody reading my
messages does group theory everyday.  So the technical slang in my
messages will not be intelligable to everybody (or in the worst case
it will not be intelligable to anybody, including myself ;-).

If this happens, please *do ask*.  Almost everthing I write is simple.
If you don't understand it, it is not your fault, it is mine, since I
wasn't clear enough.  If you do ask, I will try to explain everything.

However, I must ask you to understand that my work and my family leave
very little free time for such leisures.  So it may take me some time to
answer your questions.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

Subject: Cube Lovers on the World Wide Web

I have converted the Cube-Lovers archives into HTML.  You can now read
all old e-mail messages using your favorite WWW Browser.  Check out

    http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8000/~mschoene/Cube-Lovers/

I shall try to keep this reasonably up to date.

The conversion is done automatically with an AWK script.  It is certainly
not perfect.  If you have comments or suggestions, please write me.

Looking at this long list of e-mail messages got me wondering.
Should we try to condense the information into a few documents?
I am thinking of documents describing what is known about God's
algorithm, where those bounds come from, for which other groups
God's algorithm is known, processes for pretty patterns, etc.

The reason is I don't have the time to read all 1382 e-mail message
carefully, and I believe that this is true for others too.
I feel that there are many interesting things in Cube Lovers that
I would like to know, but won't read.  Any takers?

Have a nice day.

Martin.

    I think two of those G's are supposed to be C's, right?

Correct (wouldn't make any sense for a group G to be a subgroup in itself
of index 48 ;-).

Dan Hoey continues

    As for when I wrote

        M class             Edge         Corner       Corner times edge
          (class size)      F.P.          F.P.             / (96*class size)
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    That's not a typo.  I was just saying that column 4 is equal to column
    2 times column 3, divided by column 1, divided by 96.  Perhaps I
    should have factored column 1 out of columns 2 and 3 first to avoid
    this confusion.

Again you are correct.  But it was confusing, at least to me.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

Subject: A lemma that is *not* Burnside's

Dan Hoey writes his e-mail message of 1994/11/04 

    In January of this year, Jerry Bryan and I wrote of counting the
    number of M-conjugacy classes of Rubik's cube.  In the sense that (for
    instance) there is really only one position 1 QT from start, even
    though that QT may be applied in twelve different ways, this task
    amounts to counting the true number of positions of the cube.  The
    earlier discussion centered on calculations involving computer
    analysis of large numbers of positions.  However, a look in Paul B.
    Yale's book _Geometry and Symmetry_ gave me a clue: the Polya-Burnside
    theorem is a tool that allows us to perform this calculation by hand.

The lemma used is indeed often referred to as ``Burnside's lemma'',
or if used to count combinatorical objects as ``Polya-Burnside lemma''.

However Peter M. Neumann in his paper ``A lemma that is not Burnside's''
(1979) pointed out that this lemma was known long befor Burnside
rediscovered it.

The first appearance seems to be Cauchy's work ``Memoire sur diverses
proprietes remarquables des substitutions regulieres ou irregulieres, et
des systemes de substitutiones conjugees (suite)'' of 1845.
But it appears in a rather obscure form.

It appears in more explicit form in Frobenius' paper ``"Uber die
Congruenz nach einem aus zwei endlichen Gruppen gebildeten Doppelmodul''
in 1887.

This is well befor Burnside's paper ``On some properties of groups of
odd order'' in 1900.

Polya refined it in his paper ``Kombinatorische Anzahlbestimmungen f"ur
Gruppen, Graphen und chemische Verbindungen'' in 1937, for use in the
part of combinatorics which deals with counting problems.

Peter M. Neumann thus proposed to call this lemma ``Cauchy-Frobenius
lemma''.  But this was somehow not accepted, and it is now usually called
``A lemma that is not Burnside's''.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

Subject: Models for the Cube

I wrote in my e-mail message of 1994/11/08

    The way I view this is as follows.  The entire cube group C is a
    permutation group group on 6*9 points, generated by the six face turns U,
    D, L, R, F, B; the three middle slice turns M_U, M_L, M_F; and the
    reflection S.  This group has a subgroup M of symmetries of the cube (of
    order 48), generated by U M_U D', L M_L R', F M_F B', and S.  Another
    subgroup is G, generated by the six face turns, which has index 48 in G.
    G is a normal divisor of C, G is the semidirect product of M and G.  The
    same is true for GE and GC.

Jerry Bryan writes in his e-mail message of 1994/11/08

    I have discussed a similar view of things recently, except that I was
    not brave enough to include a reflection in the generators.  C is
    normally used to denote the set of twenty-four rotations of the
    cube (a sub-group of M), so let's call your "entire cube group"
    big_G instead.  My version of big_G was generated by Q plus the
    slice moves (like yours without the reflection), or alternatively
    by Q plus C.  Your version of big_G is hence the same as the one
    I discussed except that you added a reflection.  C (the rotations C,
    that is) is a sub-group of both versions of big_G.  M is a sub-group
    of your version of big_G, but not of mine.

    Your big_G has the obvious advantage of including M as a sub-group.
    Mine has the advantage (?) of being physically realizable on a
    real cube.  That is, for X in your big_G, rX or Xr (r is a reflection)
    is also in your big_G.  For X in my big_G, rX or Xr is not in
    big_G, and correspondingly a single reflection is not physically
    realizable on a real cube.  Of course, r'Xr is in big_G in either
    case, r being in M.  Also, cX and Xc are in either version of big_G
    for all c in C.

OK, I guess I have to be a little bit more precise and also to adapt
my terminology to common usage.  First a picture.

The maximal cube group *MG* is a permutation group on 6*9 points.
It is generated by the six face turns < U, D, L, R, F, B >, the three
rotations of the entire cube < u, l, f >, and the reflection < x >.

The complete cube group *CG*, generated by < U, D, L, R, F, B > and
< u, l, f >, is a subgroup of MG of index 2.

The cube group *G*, generated by < U, D, L, R, F, B >, is a subgroup of
index 24 in CG.  G can be viewed as a permutation group on 48 points,
since it fixes the 6 center cubies.

The group *M* of symmetries of the entire cube, generated by < u, l, f >
and < x >, is a subgroup of MG of size 48.

The group *C* of rotations of the entire cube, generated by < u, l, f >,
is a subgroup of CG of size 24.

(I would have preferred S instead of M and R instead of C, but M and C
are too widely used to change that notation.  Of course MG is not called
MG because it is the maximal cube group, but as a reminder that it is the
product of M and G.  Likewise for CG.)

Jerry continues

    I tend to think that Singmaster's standard G=<Q> is not what people
    think of when they hold a real cube in their hand.  Rather, they
    tend to think of big_G/C.  That is, the cosets of C in big_G are
    common sensically considered to be equivalent because rotating
    a real cube in space is "doing nothing".  Also, for my version
    of big_G we have |big_G/C| = |G|.

True, what people really see is the complete cube group CG (what you call
big_C).  That is, patterns corresponding to two different elements of CG
are distinct.  Now if two patterns can be made equal by rotations of the
entire cube, they ``look alike'' and most people feel that they are
equivalent since rotations ``cost nothing''.  Especially they feel that
any pattern corresponding to an element in C is solved.  Mathematically
we describe this equivalence by saying that all 24 elements in each coset
of C are equivalent.

Unfortunately C is *not* a normal subgroup of CG, and therefore CG/C is
*not* a group.  If we want to apply group theory, we need a better model.
I argue that G is indeed a good model for the 3x3x3 cube.

First note that for each coset of C in CG, there is exactly one element
of G in this coset.  This follows since C and G together generate CG and
have trivial intersection.  We call this element the representative in G
of the coset.  Thus G is a set of representatives for the cosets of C in
CG.  In group theory terminology G is a *supplement* for C (if C was a
normal subgroup, then G would be called a complement of C).  An immediate
consequence is that |G| = |CG| / |C|.

Next note that, if we assume that rotations ``cost nothing'' and middle
slice turns cost (at least) twice as much as face turns, then any two
elements in a coset of C have the same *cost*, i.e., distance from the
solved cube, and this is equal to the cost of the representative in G.

This is a simple consequence of the fact that we can transform each
process p_1 p_2 ... p_l, where each p_i is either a face turn or a
rotation of the entire cube, into one which has a single rotation of the
entire cube first and then only face turns afterwards.  This can be done
using the rule <face-turn> <rotation> => <rotation> <another-face-turn>,
which obviously doesn't change the cost of the process (remember
rotations cost nothing).

Finally note that G's structure as a group is in a certain sense CG
without C.  Namely G is a normal subgroup of CG, and the factor group
CG/G is isomorphic to C.  Ideally we would like to have G be isomorphic
to CG modulo C, but this is not well defined, as C is not a normal
subgroup.  Put another way, CG is the semidirekt product of G with C.

Unfortunately the existence of this model is particular to the 3x3x3
cube.  It does not work as well for other cubes.

First take the 2x2x2 cube group CG_2 (I use a _2 to distinguish the 2x2x2
subgroups from their 3x3x3 counterparts).  Again we have a subgroup C_2,
generated by the rotations, of size 24.  But the subgroup G_2, generated
by the six face turns, is in fact equal to CG_2.  In particular it is not
a supplement to C_2.

But we can make a similar construction.  Namely in the case of the 3x3x3
we can view CG as generated by the six face turns and the three middle
slice turns < M_U, M_D, M_F > (instead of the six face turns and the
three rotations < u, d, f >).  And our supplement G was the subgroup of
CG generated by 6 of those 9 generators, were the 3 removed ones are
pairwise perpendicular.  In the case of the 2x2x2 cube we can take the
subgroup H_2 that is generated by three turns < U, L, F >.  Using the
transformations <face-turn> <rotation> => <rotation> <another-face-turn>
and D => u' U, R => l' L, B => f' F, we can again transform any process
into one which has a single rotation first and then only < U, L, F >
turns afterwards, without changing the cost of the process (again
rotations cost nothing).

Thus H_2, of size 7!*3^6, is a good model to use when one is looking for
God's algorithm for the 2x2x2 cube.  Nothing of this is really new, I
have just casted it into a different language.  For example see
'http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8000/~mschoene/Cube-Lovers/
Jerry_Bryan__God's_Algorithm_for_the_2x2x2_Pocket_Cube.html'.

But H_2 is *not* normal, and is not CG_2 without C_2 (in the sense in
which G was CG without C).  For example CG_2 has a factor group
isomorphic to S8, but there is no such factor in H_2.

Things get worse when we look at the nxnxn cube groups CG_n.  We can find
again find a supplement H_n for C_n, if we leave out three pairwise
perpendicular slice turns.  If n is odd and if we leave out the three
middle slice turns, then H_n is again a normal subgroup (and in the same
sense as above, it is again CG_n without C_n).  On the other hand if n is
even then H_n is never a normal subgroup.  Moreover if 3 < n, then the
transformation rules tell us to replace one of the removed slice turns by
a rotation and the product of the n-1 parallel slice turns.  Thus the
transformation would only respect the cost, if we assume that the removed
three slice turns have cost n-1.  While this is arguably true for n = 3,
where most people feel that the middle slice turns have cost 2, I don't
think anybody feels that for the 4x4x4 cube nine of the slice turns have
cost 1 and 3 have cost 3.

And now for something completely different (no, not really ;-).

I have argued that G is a good model for the 3x3x3 cube assuming that
rotations of the entire cube cost nothing, and that middle slice turns
have cost 2 (or higher).  In a certain sense, we got rid of C.  That
doesn't mean we can't use C anymore.  In fact, C is still very useful.

Namely let c be any element of C, and g be any element of G.  Then c' g c
is another element of G, because G is a normal subgroup.  Moreover the
cost of c' g c is the same as the cost of g.  This is trivial because
each process effecting g can be turned into a process effecting c' g c,
by replacing each generator x in this process by c' x c.

But C is not the largest such group.  The largest such group is M, i.e.,
the full group of symmetries of the entire cube.  This is the reason why
I prefer to view G as a subgroup of MG, which is the semidirekt product
of M and G, even though I realize that MG is not physically realizable.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

Subject: Cayley Graphs

I wrote in my e-mail message of 1994/11/08

            Note that the elements of M are also a autmorphisms of the Cayley
    graph.  That means that elements of M respects the length of operations.
    That is if g_1 and g_2 are elements of G that are in one conjugacy class
    under M, then the lenght of the shortest process effecting them is equal.
    This follows from the fact that M fixes the set of the generators of G
    and their inverses.  M is fact the largest subgroup of the outer
    autmorphism group with this property, which makes it rather important.

Jerry Bryan answered in his e-mail message of 1994/11/08

    This of course is the basis for the large searches I have been able
    to perform using M-conjugate classes.  The only trouble is, I don't
    even know what a Cayley graph is (but I am working on it), the last
    course I took in group theory being 25 years ago.

The Cayley graph Gamma for a group G generated by a certain system of
generators < g_1, g_2, ... > is defined as follows.

The vertices of Gamma correspond to the elements of G.  From vertex v_1
draw an edge to v_2 labelled with g_i, if and only if v_1 g_i = v_2.
Also draw an edge from v_2 to v_2 labelled g_i^-1 (or g_i').

So the Cayley graph depends on the group *and* on the generating system.
Simple, isn't it.

In this terminology God's number for the cube is simply the diameter of
the Cayley graph of the cube group generated by the quarter face turns
(or quarter face turns and half face turns).

In general an autmorphism alpha of G maps the Cayley graph of G w.r.t.
the generating system < g_1, g_2, ... > to a new Cayley graph of G w.r.t.
the generating system < g_1^alpha, g_2^alpha, ... >.

But in this case, i.e., for the autmorphism of G induced by elements of
M, the sets { g_1, g_2, ... } and { g_1^alpha, g_2^alpha, ... } are
equal.  So the elements of M induce autmorphism of the unlabelled Cayley
graph.

And as I said, M is the largest subgroup of the outer autmorphism group
of G with this property.

Have a nice day.

    Well, call me John Henry.  Say, do you have gap libraries for other
    magic polyhedra?  For higher-dimensional magic?

I also have a permutation representation for the 2x2x2 and the 4x4x4
cube.  I must confess that I was never interested in other magic
polyhedra.

I once started writing a GAP function that creates a premutation
representation for any (hyper-)cube, i.e., 'Cube( 3, 3, 3, 2 )' would
create a 4-dimensional magic domino.  The largest problem was to define
what the ``faces'' and ``slices'' are, i.e., are they 2 or n-1
dimensional?

If there is interest, I would finish this project and also collect
permutation representations for other magic polyhedra and distribute
them together with future versions of GAP.

Have a nice day.

Dan continues

    The idea is that a mapping called evisceration allows us to permute
    the layers of the cube.  On the 4x4x4 cube, this for instance allows
    us to exchange each inner slab with its adjacent outer slab.  It also
    allows us to conjugate each inner slab move by central inversion,
    while leaving the outer slab moves alone.  In general, evisceration of
    a d-dimensional cube by f maps each feature (cubie, colortab, or
    face-center arrow) at coordinates (x[1],x[2],...,x[d]) to
    (f(x[1]),f(x[2]),...,f(x[d])), where f is a permutation of the
    intervals between the cleavage coordinates of the cube.  I believe
    that if f commutes with the central inversion, then conjugation by
    evisceration is an outer automorphism of the Rubik's cube group.  (I
    think I have proved this for d=3, and I think the proof in higher
    dimensions should not be difficult given the right notation.)

    The group of all eviscerations includes the central inversion; we can
    of course augment it by the rotation group in d-space.  Is this the
    maximum outer automorphism group that respects generators of the
    Rubik's cube?  For this we take the generators to be turns of slabs
    between adjacent cleavage planes.  (Turns are direct d-1-dimensional
    isometries.)

Allow me to reformulate your description again slightly.
Let P be a d-dimensional n*n*...*n cube.
Let m be (n-1)/2 if n is odd and n/2 if n is even.
The position of each cubie is described by its position vector
(p_1,p_2,...,p_d).  If n is odd, then each p_i comes from [-m..m].  If n
is even, then each p_i comes from [-m..-1,1..m] (no middle slice in this
case).  The orientation of a cubie is described by its orientation vector
(o_1,o_2,...,o_d), where each o_i comes from the set [-1,1].

I consider the puzzle solved, if each cubie is in its original position
and in its original orientation (this is stronger than we usually require
for the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, where we ignore the orientation of the centre
cubies, but remember, we *see* the usually invisible faces).

If F is a bijection on [-m..m] (n odd) or [-m..-1,1..m] (n even),
then F induces a permutation of the cubies (ignoring orientation) via
F( (p_1,p_2,...,p_d) ) = (F(p_1),F(p_2),...,F(p_d)).

Let I_k be defined by I_k(k) = -k, I_k(-k) = k, and I_k(l) = l for l <> k.
The permutation of the cubies induced by I_k is the inversion of the
k-th slab of the cube.

If A is a permutation on [1..m], we write l^A for the image of l under A,
and we define (-l)^A := -(l^A) (you enforce the condition (-l)^A = -(l^A)
by requiring that the permutation commutes with the central inversion).
The permutation induced by A permutes the slabs of the cube.

The group of all eviscerations is generated by all the I_k and all
permutations A of [1..m].  Each evisceration first inverts certain slabs,
and then permutes the slabs.  Put differently, the group of all
eviscerations is the wreath product of {-1,1} and S_m.
Repeating the definition of the wreath product, this means that the
group of all eviscerations is the semidirect product of the normal
subgroup generated by the I_k and the symmetric group generated by the A.

This group, together with the group C of symmetries of the d-dimensional
cube P, is a subgroup of the automorphism group of P, which fixes the set
of generators (with any reasonable definition of what the generators of P
are), and thus respects the distance of elements in the Cayley graph.

Is this the largest such group?  In the case that d = 3, this is true.
In the case of larger d, I am quite certain it is true if the generators
are rotations of 2 dimensional subsets of P.  If we choose the generators
to be symmetries of d-1 dimensional subsets of P, then I still believe it
is true.  But I have been fooled often enough in such situations, to not
trust my intuition without a proof.

If we can agree on a precise definition of what the generators of the d
dimensional cube are, I would be happy to compute the largest subgroup of
the automorphism group that respects the distance of elements in the
Cayley graph.

Have a nice day.

Martin.

Subject: Group Products

Dan Hoey writes in his e-mail message of 1994/11/08

                                                             What is the
    difference between a direct product and a semidirect product?

Allow to answer this in greater detail, and describe all the important
products of groups.  It is one of the marvels of Rubik's cube that all
these products arise in a very natural fashion when one investigates it.

Direct Product
--------------

We say that a group D is the *direct product* of its two subgroups
M and N, if M and N together generate the whole group D, M and N
have trivial intersection, and M and N are both normal subgroups.
This implies that D is isomorphic to the group of pairs (m,n),
where the multiplication is defined componentwise,
i.e., (m_1,n_1) * (m_2,n_2) = (m_1 * n_2, m_1 * n_2).

Here is a little picture to describe the situation.

       D
      / \
     /   \
    M     \
     \     N
      \   /
       \ /
        1

M and N are the factors, D is their direct product.
Note that D/N ~ M and D/M ~ N (X ~ Y means that X and Y are isomorphic).
So M and N appear both as subgroups and quotients of the direct product.

Direct products are very simple.  They are fully described by their
to factors M and N.  Also many properties follow easily from the
corresponding properties of the factors, e.g.., |M*N| = |M| * |M|.

For an example lets take a group G+ that is a little bit larger than the
group G of Rubik's cube, namely we also allow to exchange two edges
*without* exchanging two corners simultaneously (don't ask me how this
could be realized physically).  This group is the direct product of two
subgroups GC and GE.  GC is the stabilizer of the edges, i.e., the
subgroup of those elements that do not permute the edges at all, and thus
operates only on the corners. GE is the stabilizer of the corners, i.e.,
the subgroup of those elements that do not permute the corners, and thus
operates only on the edges.  G+ is isomorphic to the group of pairs (c,e)
with c in GC and e in GE.  That means, each element of G+ can be
described by describing how it operates on the corners and on the edges
(this is trivial).  And for any c in GC and any e in GE, there is an
element in G+ that operates like c on the corners and like e on the edges.
The latter is not true in G, which is a subgroup of index 2 in G+.

Semidirect Product
------------------

We say that a group S is the *semidirect product* of its two subgroups
H and N, if H and N together generate the whole group S, H and N have
trivial intersection, and N is a normal subgroup (but H need not be
normal).  This implies that S is isomorphic to the group of pairs (h,n),
where the multiplication is defined as follows
(h_1,n_1) * (h_2,n_2) = (h_1 * h_2, h_2^-1 * n_1 * h_2 * n_2).
Note that h^-1 * n * h is usually written as n ^ h.

A picture for this situation would be identical to the picture for the
direct product, since the only real difference to the direct product is
that H need not be normal.

Again both H and N appear as subgroups of S, but only H appears as
factor of S, namely S/N ~ H.  Note that S/H is *not* well defined,
since H is not a normal subgroup of S.

Semidirect products are almost as simple as direct products.  They
are described by their factors H and N, and the operation of H on N,
by specifying what n^h is for every h in H and n in N
(note that n^h is again in N, because N is a normal subgroup).
And again many properties of S can be easily calculated from the
corresponding properties of H and N.

For an example let S be the group generated by the six face turns and
rotations of the entire cube (or equivalently the six face turns and the
three middle slice turns).  Let G be the subgroup of S generated by the
six face turns.  Let C be the subgroup of S generated by the rotations of
the entire cube, which has size 24.  Obviously C and G together generate
S.  C and G have trivial intersection, since every element of G fixes the
orientation of entire cube, but only the trivial element in C fixes the
entire cube.  Finally G is normal, since for each generator (face turn) g
of G and each h in H the element g^h is again in G (in fact it is again a
generator or an inverse of a generator).  Thus S is a semidirect product
of C and G.

Subdirect Product
-----------------

Let M and N be two groups.  Let D be the direct product of M and N.
Let f: M -> H and g: N -> H be two homomorphisms onto a group H.
Then the subgroup S = {(m,n) in D | f(m) = g(n)} of D is called a
*subdirect product* of M and N.

Again a little picture to describe the situation.

            D
          / | \
         /  |  \
        /   |   \
       /    S    \
      /     |     \
     /      |      \
    M       |       \
     \      |        N
      \     S-      /
       \   / \     /
        \ /   \   /
         M-    \ /
          \     N-
           \   /
            \ /
             1

M and N are the two factors, D is their direct product.
S is the subdirect product for the equation f(u) = g(v).
M- is the kern of f, and N- is the kern of g.
Thus M/M- = M/kern(f) ~ image(f) = H = image(g) ~ N/kern(g) = N/N-.
S- is the direct product of M- and N- and is a subgroup of S
(namely the subgroup such that f(u) = g(v) = 1).
It is easy to see that S/N- ~ M and S/M- ~ N.
So M and N appear as quotients of S.
But note that M and N *do not* appear as subgroups of S!
Also note that S/N- ~ M and S/M- ~ N implies that S/S- ~ H.

Thus M and N have a common quotient H, and in the subdirect product
we have ``glued'' these two quotients together.

For an example lets again look at the direct product G+ of GC and GE.
I have already mentioned that G is a subgroup of index 2 in G+.
It is in fact a subdirect of GC and GE.  Namely H = {-1,1},
f(c) is the parity (sign) of the permutation of the corners by c, and
g(e) is the parity (sign) of the permutation of the edges by e.
In other words, G is the subdirect product of GC and GE with
the condition that whenever we exchange two corners we also
exchange two edges.

This is in fact no coincidence.  Whenever one has a permutation group
that has more than one orbit, it is a subdirect product of the operations
on the individual orbits.

Wreath Product
--------------

Let M be an abitrary group.  Let H be a permutation group operating on
[1..n].  For h in H and i in [1..n], we write the image of i under h as
i^h.  The *wreath product* W = M wr H, is the semidirect product of the
normal subgroup N = M^n (i.e., the direct product of n copies of M),
with the subgroup H, where H operates by permuting the components of N,
(i.e., (m_1,m_2,...,m_n)^h := (m_{1^h},m_{2^h},...,m_{n^h})).

For an example take the following permutation group W:
< ( 1, 2, 3), ( 4, 5, 6), ( 7, 8, 9), (10,11,12),
  (13,14,15), (16,17,18), (19,20,21), (22,23,24),
  ( 1, 4)( 2, 5)( 3, 6),
  ( 4, 7,10,13,16,19,22)( 5, 8,11,14,17,20,23)( 6, 9,12,15,18,21,24) >.
The first 8 generators generate a direct product N of 8 cyclic groups of
size 3, which is a normal subgroup in G.  The last 2 generators generate
a symmetric group of degree 8, operating on the 8 factors of the direct
factors of N.  Thus W = C_3 wr S_8.

W operates on the set { {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, ..., {22,23,24} }, called a
blocksystem for W.  To describe what an element w in W does, we first say
how it operates on each block, and then how it permutes the blocks.
On the other hand, if we have a permutation group that has a blocksystem,
then this permutation group is a subgroup of the wreath product.

The group GC, operating only on the corners of the cube, is a subgroup of
index 3 in the above group W.  For each element of GC, you first say how
it changes the orientation of the 8 corners (the C_3^8) and then how it
permutes the 8 corners (the S_8).  The index 3 comes from the fact that
we cannot change the orientation of a single corner in GC; if we turn
one corner clockwise, we must turn another corner counterclockwise.

Have a nice day.

Well, with great fear and trepidation, let's see if we can't interpret
CG/C in such a way that it is a group.  I agree that your statement
above is correct, but I believe we are interpreting C, G, and CG
somewhat differently.  I have discussed this subject before, but
armed with some better notation suggested via Dan Hoey, I think I
can do it again both more accurately and more succinctly.

Dan's suggestion is to carefully distinguish which of the various
types of cubies we are talking about.  I have done a lot of work
with (for example) corners-only-cubes-without-centers, corners-only-
cubes-with-centers, etc.  When we talk about the set C of rotations,
Dan suggests specifying such things as C[C] (Corners-only),
C[E] (Edges-only], C[C,F] (Corners-plus-Face-centers), etc.  The
C[C] thing looks funny, using C in two such different ways, but
there are only so many letters.  I want to reserve lower case c for
elements of C, so I will live with C[C].

I would suggest extending the notation to G and Q, so that (for example)
the corners-only with Face-centers group we have called GC could instead
be called G[C,F] = <Q[C,F]>, and the 2x2x2 cube could be called
GC=<QC> because there are no Face-centers.

The "standard Singmaster model" (my terminology) would be written
as G[C,E,F] = <Q[C,E,F]>.  (Well, I think Singmaster would write it as
G[C,E,F] = <Q[C,E,F], H[C,E,F]>, since I think he prefers to
accept H turns as single moves.)

However, I tend to work with G[C,E] = <Q[C,E]> instead.  I consider
G[C,E] to be equivalent to G[C,E,F] for most purposes because G fixes
the Face-centers, as does M-conjugation.  I have described this
equivalence before as the Face-centers simply providing a frame of
reference that can be provided in other ways.  However, when you step
outside the friendly confines of G=<Q>, it does start to matter whether
the Face-centers are there or not.  As an example important to this
discussion, if you consider CG=<Q,C>, then it makes a considerable
difference whether you are talking about CGC,E or CGC,E,F.

For example, G[C,E] = <Q[C,E]> can be simulated on a real cube
by removing the color tabs from the Face-centers, by
restricting yourself to Q moves only (no whole cube rotations or
slices), and by declaring the cube solved only when the Up color
is up and the Front color is Front.  Notice that with the Face
centers absent, you can make the cube look solved even when it
isn't.  It will be rotated instead, but it won't be solved.

This model may seem a little simple-minded.  Why are no rotations
allowed, and why don't you count it as solved when it looks solved?
But computers are simple-minded.  My programs only consider things
equal when they are literally equal, and equivalence is something
I have to program in.  As an example I have used before,
consider G[C]=<Q[C]>, modeled in the real world by a 2x2x2 pocket cube
or by removing both the edge and Face-center color tabs from a 3x3x3
cube.  Take a solved cube in GC and perform RL'.  The cube will still
look solved, but it will be rotated.  The memory cells in my program
will not be the same for I as for RL', but I want to treat them as
equivalent, as would nearly everybody with a real world 2x2x2 cube
in their hands.

This is where I have claimed before that a model that treats RL' the same
as I is G[C]/C[C].  The idea is that G[C]/C[C] is a group with the
identity being C[C] itself (i.e., rotating the cube is "doing
nothing".)  The proof is fairly simple.  From each element (coset) of
G[C]/C[C], pick the unique permutation that fixes a particular
corner, say UFR, and form a new set G[C]* containing the one element
chosen from each coset.  The elements of G[C]/C[C]
are sets (namely cosets), but the elements of G[C]* are permutations
which are also in G[C].  In particular, G[C]* = <D[C],B[C],L[C]>.
Hence, G[C]* is a group.

Note that the generators of G[C]* are
the twists of those faces which are diagonally opposed to the
corner fixed by the selection function from G[C]/C[C] to G[C]*.
Hence, the generators fix the same corner as the selection function,
showing that <D[C],B[C],L[C]> is really the same set as G[C]*,
namely the set of all cubes in G[C] for which the UFR corner is
fixed.  Finally, there is an obvious isomorphism between G[C]/C[C]
and <D[C],B[C],L[C]>.  Namely, to multiply two cosets, map each
to <D[C],B[C],L[C]> via the selection function, perform the multiplication
there using standard cube multiplication, and map the
product back to a coset.  Hence, G[C]/C[C] is a group.

A similar argument applies to G[E]/C[E] except that we have to fix
an edge cubie instead of a corner cubie.  A similar argument applies
to G[C,E]/C[C,E] except we have to fix an edge cubie and restrict C to
even permutations.  Dan calls the set of even rotations E, so let's
call it G[C,E]/E[C,E].  (Still wish we had letters whose use
did not conflict so blatantly.)

But when we started, we were talking about CG/C, not about G/C.
However, notice that when our model does not include Face-centers,
we have <Q[C]> = <Q[C],C[C]>, <Q[E]> = <Q[E],C[E]>,
and <Q[C,E]> = <Q[C,E],E[C,E]>.  (I mean that the groups are equal, not
that the Cayley graphs are the same.)  Hence, speaking generically of
the first two cases, we have C is in G, CG=G, and both CG/C and G/C are
groups.  In the last case, we have to say E is in G, EG=G, and EG/E is
a group.  But we can go one step further.  Since there are no Face-centers,
we can admit Slice moves or C as generators (it doesn't matter which),
and we no longer have to restrict ourselves to even rotations.
We can say G+C,E=<QC,E,CC,E> and we will have C is in G+,
CG+=G+, and CG+/C is a group which is the same size as EG/E. (G+ is twice
as big as G, of course.)

I guess this must mean that CC, CE, and CC,E are all normal
subgroups of their respective CG's, but that CC,F, CE,F, and
CC,E,F are not.  That should not be surprising.  Having the
Face-centers there only as a frame of reference and never moving
is not the same as having them there and really moving (as when you
rotate the entire cube).

After joining Cube-Lovers, I discovered that others
had solved God's algorithm for the 2x2x2 long before me.  I was expecting
my solution to be 24*48 times smaller than theirs because I was using
cosets of C and M-conjugates.  But my solution was only
48 times smaller than theirs.  By taking both cosets and M-conjugates
I really had reduced <QC> by 24*48 times.  However, everybody else
who worked on the problem had modeled it as something like
<DC,BC,LC>, fixing a corner.  (Any other corner would do as well.
There are eight conjugate groups, any of which would do as well as any
other.) <DC,BC,LC> is 24 times smaller than <QC> in the first
place, and as I said earlier, <QC> is equivalent to <QC,F> for
most purposes anyway because of the fixed Face-centers.  Hence,
everybody else had a 24 times head start on me.  (At the time,
Dan suggested that I was increasing the size of the problem by 24 and
then reducing it by 24*48 for a net reduction of 48.  But that would
only be true if the model were <QC,F>.  Since the model was <QC>,
there really was a reduction of 24*48.  But <QC> does not really
model the 2x2x2 cube, and is 24 times larger than it needs to be in
the first place if you are trying to model the 2x2x2.)

Modeling cubes without centers such as the 2x2x2 is trickier than it
looks because of the requirement that rotations be treated as
equivalent.  I did it by using cosets of rotations; everybody else
did it by fixing a corner.  But before I realized all this, I went on
a Quixotic chase for a model which would simultaneously be a true
model for a 2x2x2 cube and would retain the cubic symmetry of the
problem (whatever that means).  There are articles in the archives
concerning this subject, with the conclusion that no such model is
possible because any true model would be isomorphic to <DC,BC,LC>,
which does not have "cubic symmetry".

I guess the "cubic symmetry of the problem" means that you should use
M-conjugate classes.  Recall that when I solved <U,R> I used what
Dan calls W-conjugate classes because W is the symmetry group
for <U,R>, and W-conjugate classes reduced the size of the problem
by four times.  This leads me to a question.  The way I modeled
the 2x2x2, I used M-conjugate classes of cosets and reduced the size of
the problem by 48 times.  If I were going to model <DC,BC,LC>,
I would be very inclined not to use M-conjugate classes, but rather to
use a subgroup of M which was the symmetry group of <DC,BC,LC>.
The subgroup would have less than 48 elements, and I would get less
than a 48 times reduction in the size of the problem.  But a fixed
corner model such as <DC,BC,LC> is isomorphic to a coset model
such as <QC>/CC, and M-conjugates are appropriate to the coset
model.  Therefore, my analysis of the situation is obviously very
flawed.  Can anybody see what is wrong?

But can't you speak of conjugates such as m'gm without regard to G
being a subgroup of MG?  I agree that MG seems like a very useful group,
and it is a very nice model of what is going on.  But doesn't g in G
imply m'gm in G whether I ever heard of MG or not?

These are fine points, but they bother me anyway.

  1. Suppose I write <Q>=<Q,H>.  If I mean that the group <Q> is equal
     to the group <Q,H>, then the equation is correct.  If I mean that
     the Cayley graph of <Q> is the same as the Cayley graph of <Q,H>,
     then the equation is incorrect.  Which is the conventional meaning?
     Is the meaning universal, or does it depend on the author and the
     context?

  2. I gather from your note and from things that Dan sent me that
     one should not list inverses of the generators.  For example,
     <U,R> is sufficient and one should not write <U,U',R,R'>.  But
     people conventionally write <Q> which includes six processes and
     their six inverses.  Is this acceptable usage, or should we write
     <U,D,L,R,F,B> instead?

As an additional comment, I have frequently written about the Q length
of a process in <U,R> or the Q+H length of a process in <U,R>.  I think
we would be better served to talk about the length of a process in
<U,R> or the length of a process in <U,U2,R,R2> if the generator
notation implies a particular Cayley graph.

I would like to know if there is any place where I can purchase 
"mind-boggling" cubes from.  

Also, if anyone knows Peter Beck's internet address, please let me know.

Thanks.

here you're using  "<Q>"  to denote the group.

but now you're trying to use the same symbol to denote the cayley graph.

the context should make it clear which object (group or graph) the symbols
refer to.  as martin notes above, these are quite different objects.

either is acceptable, whether you're referring to groups or cayley graphs.

however, for cayley digraphs (directed graphs), the two meanings are quite
different.  i don't imagine we'll have anything to do with digraphs until
someone complains that they can only turn the faces of their cube clockwise,
and wants to know some short processes.

in our case,  "<Q>"  is preferred, since it's shorter.

yes, this terminology is more precise, but the meaning was already clear.

Well, with great fear and trepidation, let's see if we can't interpret
CG/C in such a way that it is a group.  I agree that your statement
above is correct, but I believe we are interpreting C, G, and CG
somewhat differently.  I have discussed this subject before, but
armed with some better notation suggested via Dan Hoey, I think I
can do it again both more accurately and more succinctly.

Dan's suggestion is to carefully distinguish which of the various
types of cubies we are talking about.  I have done a lot of work
with (for example) corners-only-cubes-without-centers, corners-only-
cubes-with-centers, etc.  When we talk about the set C of rotations,
Dan suggests specifying such things as C[C] (Corners-only),
C[E] (Edges-only), C[C,F] (Corners-plus-Face-centers), etc.  The
C[C] thing looks funny, using C in two such different ways, but
there are only so many letters.  I want to reserve lower case c for
elements of C, so I will live with C[C].

I would suggest extending the notation to G and Q, so that (for example)
the corners-only with Face-centers group we have called GC could instead
be called G[C,F] = <Q[C,F]>, and the 2x2x2 cube could be called
G[C]=<Q[C]> because there are no Face-centers.

The "standard Singmaster model" (my terminology) would be written
as G[C,E,F] = <Q[C,E,F]>.  (Well, I think Singmaster would write it as
G[C,E,F] = <Q[C,E,F], H[C,E,F]>, since I think he prefers to
accept H turns as single moves.)

However, I tend to work with G[C,E] = <Q[C,E]> instead.  I consider
G[C,E] to be equivalent to G[C,E,F] for most purposes because G fixes
the Face-centers, as does M-conjugation.  I have described this
equivalence before as the Face-centers simply providing a frame of
reference that can be provided in other ways.  However, when you step
outside the friendly confines of G=<Q>, it does start to matter whether
the Face-centers are there or not.  As an example important to this
discussion, if you consider CG=<Q,C>, then it makes a considerable
difference whether you are talking about CG[C,E] or CG[C,E,F].

For example, G[C,E] = <Q[C,E]> can be simulated on a real cube
by removing the color tabs from the Face-centers, by
restricting yourself to Q moves only (no whole cube rotations or
slices), and by declaring the cube solved only when the Up color
is up and the Front color is Front.  Notice that with the Face
centers absent, you can make the cube look solved even when it
isn't.  It will be rotated instead, but it won't be solved.

This model may seem a little simple-minded.  Why are no rotations
allowed, and why don't you count it as solved when it looks solved?
But computers are simple-minded.  My programs only consider things
equal when they are literally equal, and equivalence is something
I have to program in.  As an example I have used before,
consider G[C]=<Q[C]>, modeled in the real world by a 2x2x2 pocket cube
or by removing both the edge and Face-center color tabs from a 3x3x3
cube.  Take a solved cube in G[C] and perform RL'.  The cube will still
look solved, but it will be rotated.  The memory cells in my program
will not be the same for I as for RL', but I want to treat them as
equivalent, as would nearly everybody with a real world 2x2x2 cube
in their hands.

This is where I have claimed before that a model that treats RL' the same
as I is G[C]/C[C].  The idea is that G[C]/C[C] is a group with the
identity being C[C] itself (i.e., rotating the cube is "doing
nothing".)  The proof is fairly simple.  From each element (coset) of
G[C]/C[C], pick the unique permutation that fixes a particular
corner, say UFR, and form a new set G[C]* containing the one element
chosen from each coset.  The elements of G[C]/C[C]
are sets (namely cosets), but the elements of G[C]* are permutations
which are also in G[C].  In particular, G[C]* = <D[C],B[C],L[C]>.
Hence, G[C]* is a group.

Note that the generators of G[C]* are
the twists of those faces which are diagonally opposed to the
corner fixed by the selection function from G[C]/C[C] to G[C]*.
Hence, the generators fix the same corner as the selection function,
showing that <D[C],B[C],L[C]> is really the same set as G[C]*,
namely the set of all cubes in G[C] for which the UFR corner is
fixed.  Finally, there is an obvious isomorphism between G[C]/C[C]
and <D[C],B[C],L[C]>.  Namely, to multiply two cosets, map each
to <D[C],B[C],L[C]> via the selection function, perform the multiplication
there using standard cube multiplication, and map the
product back to a coset.  Hence, G[C]/C[C] is a group.

A similar argument applies to G[E]/C[E] except that we have to fix
an edge cubie instead of a corner cubie.  A similar argument applies
to G[C,E]/C[C,E] except we have to fix an edge cubie and restrict C to
even permutations.  Dan calls the set of even rotations E, so let's
call it G[C,E]/E[C,E].  (Still wish we had letters whose use
did not conflict so blatantly.)

But when we started, we were talking about CG/C, not about G/C.
However, notice that when our model does not include Face-centers,
we have <Q[C]> = <Q[C],C[C]>, <Q[E]> = <Q[E],C[E]>,
and <Q[C,E]> = <Q[C,E],E[C,E]>.  (I mean that the groups are equal, not
that the Cayley graphs are the same.)  Hence, speaking generically of
the first two cases, we have C is in G, CG=G, and both CG/C and G/C are
groups.  In the last case, we have to say E is in G, EG=G, and EG/E is
a group.  But we can go one step further.  Since there are no Face-centers,
we can admit Slice moves or C as generators (it doesn't matter which),
and we no longer have to restrict ourselves to even rotations.
We can say G+[C,E]=<Q[C,E],C[C,E]> and we will have C is in G+,
CG+=G+, and CG+/C is a group which is the same size as EG/E. (G+ is twice
as big as G, of course.)

I guess this must mean that C[C], C[E], and C[C,E] are all normal
subgroups of their respective CG's, but that C[C,F], C[E,F], and
C[C,E,F] are not.  That should not be surprising.  Having the
Face-centers there only as a frame of reference and never moving
is not the same as having them there and really moving (as when you
rotate the entire cube).

After joining Cube-Lovers, I discovered that others
had solved God's algorithm for the 2x2x2 long before me.  I was expecting
my solution to be 24*48 times smaller than theirs because I was using
cosets of C and M-conjugates.  But my solution was only
48 times smaller than theirs.  By taking both cosets and M-conjugates
I really had reduced <Q[C]> by 24*48 times.  However, everybody else
who worked on the problem had modeled it as something like
<D[C],B[C],L[C]>, fixing a corner.  (Any other corner would do as well.
There are eight conjugate groups, any of which would do as well as any
other.) <D[C],B[C],L[C]> is 24 times smaller than <Q[C]> in the first
place, and as I said earlier, <Q[C]> is equivalent to <Q[C,F]> for
most purposes anyway because of the fixed Face-centers.  Hence,
everybody else had a 24 times head start on me.  (At the time,
Dan suggested that I was increasing the size of the problem by 24 and
then reducing it by 24*48 for a net reduction of 48.  But that would
only be true if the model were <Q[C,F]>.  Since the model was <Q[C]>,
there really was a reduction of 24*48.  But <Q[C]> does not really
model the 2x2x2 cube, and is 24 times larger than it needs to be in
the first place if you are trying to model the 2x2x2.)

Modeling cubes without centers such as the 2x2x2 is trickier than it
looks because of the requirement that rotations be treated as
equivalent.  I did it by using cosets of rotations; everybody else
did it by fixing a corner.  But before I realized all this, I went on
a Quixotic chase for a model which would simultaneously be a true
model for a 2x2x2 cube and would retain the cubic symmetry of the
problem (whatever that means).  There are articles in the archives
concerning this subject, with the conclusion that no such model is
possible because any true model would be isomorphic to <D[C],B[C],L[C]>,
which does not have "cubic symmetry".

I guess the "cubic symmetry of the problem" means that you should use
M-conjugate classes.  Recall that when I solved <U,R> I used what
Dan calls W-conjugate classes because W is the symmetry group
for <U,R>, and W-conjugate classes reduced the size of the problem
by four times.  This leads me to a question.  The way I modeled
the 2x2x2, I used M-conjugate classes of cosets and reduced the size of
the problem by 48 times.  If I were going to model <D[C],B[C],L[C]>,
I would be very inclined not to use M-conjugate classes, but rather to
use a subgroup of M which was the symmetry group of <D[C],B[C],L[C]>.
The subgroup would have less than 48 elements, and I would get less
than a 48 times reduction in the size of the problem.  But a fixed
corner model such as <D[C],B[C],L[C]> is isomorphic to a coset model
such as <Q[C]>/C[C], and M-conjugates are appropriate to the coset
model.  Therefore, my analysis of the situation is obviously very
flawed.  Can anybody see what is wrong?
