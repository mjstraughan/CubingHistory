## L5EP 4U + 1D

### First Development

L5EP was first proposed by Mike Bennett in December, 2005 on the Speed Solving Rubik's Cube Yahoo group [^bennett-2005] [^bennett-2006-1]. Mike Bennet developed the algorithms and placed them on a website in January, 2006 [^bennett-2006-2].

### Other Developments and Popularity

#### Second Development

In mid-2006, Michael James Straughan independently had the same idea and developed the algorithms for use in the MI1 method [^straughan-2006].

#### Popularity

In 2008 Kennth Gustavsson developed a naming system for each case [^gustavsson-2008]. Within Kenneth's thread, Straughan developed and posted an arrow-based representation image using Kenneth's naming scheme and the algorithms previously developed by Straughan [^straughan-2008-1] [^straughan-2008-2]. The image and the wiki page helped L5EP gain some popularity, eventually making its way into various methods. Some example methods include ZZ-Portico, Hawaiian Kociemba, Mehta, and Squall.

#### Alternate Naming Scheme

An alternate set of names for each case was developed by Andrew Mahovich and Cubingcubecuber [^mahovich-cubingcubecuber-2020-1] [^mahovich-cubingcubecuber-2020-2].
