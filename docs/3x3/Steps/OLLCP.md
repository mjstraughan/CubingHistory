## Description

OLLCP is a method for solving the last layer.

**Proposer:** [Masayuki Akimoto](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#akimoto-masayuki), others

**Proposed:** Early 2000s.

**Steps:**

1. Solve the last layer corners and orient all last layer edges.
2. Permute the last layer edges.

## Origin

### Masayuki Akimoto

The first known mention of OLLCP is in February 2005 [^stuber-2005]. Masayuki Akimoto was in the process of generating the algorithms [^akimoto-2005] [^li-2005].

### Kenneth Gustavsson

In the mid-2000s, Kenneth Gustavsson started working on OLLCP as well [^gustavsson-2006-1] [^gustavsson-2006-2] [^gustavsson-2008]. Gustavsson's name for the algorithm set was XCLL.

### Thom Barlow

In 2011, Thom Barlow developed a version of OLLCP that uses combinations of short algorithms to solve each case [^barlow-2011-1] [^barlow-2011-2].

## Name

As seen in the initial proposals, Gustavsson had given the algorithm set the name XCLL. It was around 2010 that the community began calling it OLLCP [^barlow-brooks-2010] [^barlow-2010].
