A collection of L3C reduction strategies proposed by [Matt DiPalma](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#dipalma-matt).

## Speed-Heise

Speed-Heise was first proposed in December, 2014 on the Italian site speedcubing.it [^dipalma-2014].

Two versions of Speed-Heise were added to DiPalma's blog in March, 2015. One was called Simplified [^dipalma-2015-1] and the other was called Complete [^dipalma-2015-2].

## Tripod Supplement

In March, 2015 DiPalma developed the algorithms for the Tripod method to permute all edges and solve the DFR corner [^dipalma-2015-3].

## Cardan Reduction

In March, 2017 DiPalma proposed Cardan Reduction [^dipalma-2017-1].

## CR†

CR† was proposed in the same post as Cardan Reduction [^dipalma-2017-1].

## SIMPLE

SIMPLE was proposed in August, 2017 [^dipalma-2017-2].

## Early Developments

In July, 2012, DiPalma posted a couple of messages to speedsolving.com that may have been the start of DiPalma's exploration of L3C ideas [^dipalma-nd-1] [^dipalma-nd-2].
