## Description

**Proposer:** [Guus Razoux Schultz](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#schultz-guus-razoux)

**Proposed:** 1981

**Steps:**

1. Cross: Solve the four bottom layer edges.
2. First Two Layers (F2L): Solve the four corner and edge pairs around the bottom two layers.
3. Corners of the Last Layer (CLL): Solve the corners of the upper layer.
4. Edges of the Last Layer (ELL): Solve the edges of the upper layer.

## Proposal

Guus Razoux Schultz started developing CFCE in September, 1981 [^schultz-2022]. A few months later, Schultz learned of the F2L pair concept and integrated it into his method.

> Schultz described the method's origins to me in the above private message.

## World Rubik's Cube Championship 1982

Schultz used CFCE at the World Rubik's Cube Championship 1982 [^singmaster-1982]. This makes Schultz the first person to have used the F2L pairing technique in an official World Cube Association competition.
