## Description

**Proposer:** [Marc Waterman](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#waterman-marc), [Daan Krammer](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#krammer-daan)

**Proposed:** 1981

**Steps:**

1. Solve the left side layer minus one edge.
2. Solve the right side corners.
3. Solve three of the right side edges and fine final left side edge.
4. Solve the final right side edge and orient the edges of the M layer.
5. Permute the M layer.

> The Waterman method contains many variants. The one described on this page is known as "Simplified Waterman".

## Origin

### Waterman

The Waterman method was developed in 1981. As booklet was produced describing the method and published as part of Cubing For Fun [^waterman-treep-1987].

> Much of this information is found in David Singmaster's _Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube'_. I reached out to Georges Helm, who owns copies of these books. He kindly wrote out the steps of the methods in each book. Waterman and Kraamer's development of the Waterman method is likely the most thorough of them all with hundreds of edge solving algorithms developed, full CLL, and a recognition method for CLL.
