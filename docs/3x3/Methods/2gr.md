## Description

**Proposer:** [John Li](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#li-john-teoidus)

**Proposed:** 2017

**Steps:**

1. EOPair: Solve the pair at bDL while orienting all edges of the cube. The edges are oriented along the z axis.
2. Extend the pair to a 1x1x3 line at DL while permuting all remaining corners along the z axis. Afterward, the corners are solvable using turns of just the U and R layers.
3. Extend the 1x1x3 block to a 2x2x3 block at dl.
4. Complete the first two layers by solving the 1x2x3 block at dR.
5. Solve the last layer.

## Proposal

In April, 2017 John Li proposed 2GR [1, 2].

2GR was eventually moved to a new site [3].
