## Description

**Proposer:** [Doug Li](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#li-doug)

**Proposed:** 2002

**Steps:**

1. Solve the FL and BL edges.
2. Solve the UFL and UBL corners.
3. Solve the UF and UB edges.
4. Solve either 1x2x2 at the top right.
5. Solve the corner and edge pair that belongs with the 1x2x2 from the previous step.
6. Solve the remaining edge of the first two layers while orienting the last layer edges.
7. Solve the corners of the last layer, preserving the edge orientation.
8. Permute the last layer edges.

>It was common in the early 2000s and prior to solve pieces from the top down, leaving unsolved pieces on the bottom of the cube. The method as originally described has the last layer on the bottom of the cube.

### Doug Li Block

Doug Li requested that a 2x2x3 block minus the edge between the two corners be called a "Doug Li Block" [2].
