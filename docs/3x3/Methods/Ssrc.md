## Description

**Proposer:** [Silky](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#silky)

**Proposed:** 2020

**Steps:**

1. Solve a 1x2x3 block on the left side.
2. Solve the front and back pairs on the right side.
3. Solve the upper layer corners.
4. Solve the last seven edges.

## Origin

### Development

In June, 2020, Silky posted a method idea that was a combination of Roux and the SOAP method for the 2x2 puzzle [1]. The steps were similar to the current form of SSRC, except the E slice edges were solved before solving the last six corners.

Over time the method evolved to include blockbuilding before solving the last layer corners [2, 3].

### Proposal

In March, 2024, Silky proposed the finalized version of the method [4]. Complete algorithm sheets and variants were provided.

## L7E

### Iterative EO and LRP

In March, 2022, Michael James Straughan developed iterative EO for L7E. A complete L7E method was also developed that follows similar steps to the standard Roux LSE method [5, 6, 7]. The steps are edge orientation, permute the left and right side edges, then permute the M slice.

### EODR

As part of the official proposal in March, 2024, Silky included the development of an L7E method [8]. The steps are to orient all edges while solving the DR edge. Then the final six edges are permuted.
