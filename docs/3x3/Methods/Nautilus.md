## Origin

### Development

During development of the MI1 method, Michael James Straughan determined that the empty edge slot at DR for the primary shape caused ergonomics issues [^straughan-2010]. It was decided to solve the edge as part of the primary shape. This led to a new variant of MI1 and was later branched off as its own method called Nautilus.

### Re-Development

In 2020, Straughan again began experimenting with the method [^straughan-2020]. It was then decided to re-develop and present the method to the community with new algorithms [^straughan-2020].
