## Origin

On the webpage for the Salvia method, Salvia states that he first got a cube in 1981 [^salvia-nd]. It is possible that the method was developed in that same year.

Salvia first described the method in December, 2003 [^salvia-2003]. This description led to the method getting its own dedicated page on speedcubing.com
