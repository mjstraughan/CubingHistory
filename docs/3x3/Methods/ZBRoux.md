## Description

**Proposer:** Various

**Proposed:** Numerous

**Steps:**

1. Build a 1x2x3 block on the left.
2. Build a 1x2x3 block on the right..
3. Solve the DF and DB edges and M layer centers while orienting the last layer edges.
4. Solve the last layer.

## Origin

ZBRoux is a method that continues to be proposed numerous times. The first known suggestion of the idea comes from Michael James Straughan in June, 2010 [^straughan-2010]. Various other proposals can be found in the online community [^gu-2010] [^criticalcubing-2017] [^kuatsyen-2023].
