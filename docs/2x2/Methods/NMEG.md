# NMEG

<ReconViewer

## Description

**Creator:** [Michael James Straughan](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#straughan-michael-james-athefre)

**Created:** 2012

**Steps:**

1. Build a face on the bottom layer. The two corners on the right side are placed swapped. The corners of the bottom layer on one side are also free to be from another layer.
2. Solve the four upper layer corners while correctly permuting the bottom layer. Undo the pseudo state at the end.
