# Fewest Moves Solving Origins

After the cube craze came to an end in the early 1980s, many enthusiasts continued exploring the puzzle's potential. One new way to competitively solve the cube was to attempt to solve it in fewer moves than other competitors. This type of competition proved to be popular, leading to it becoming an official event of the World Cube Association.

## Cubism For Fun

### 9th Issue

In February 1985, the 9th issue of Cubism For Fun introduced a new kind of solving competition to its members [^steenhuis-1985-1]. Instead of solving Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible, the idea was for the members to solve given scrambles in as few moves as possible and send in their solutions. The submission with the fewest moves was declared the winner. This competition was accompanied by a few rules:

1. Every turn must be included. Simply referencing a sequence of moves, or an algorithm, from a previous Cubism For Fun issue without writing the sequence wasn't allowed. There was one exception to this rule, which was that members were allowed to send in reference numbers from the one look last layer table that was in development and peridically published in Cubism For Fun.
2. The moves were counted in the half turn metric.
3. The notation must be understandable and rotations must be indicated.

For the first competition the thought process was that if a simple scramble was provided anyone could submit the inverse. So it was decided to provide a 72 move scramble, from which a shorter solution would likely be found.

Original scramble translated into modern standard notation: `L' D U B2 D F' R B R B R' U2 F2 L2 D F U' D B U F2 U' F' D2 R B L D' B2 R F2 B2 L D B U' F L' U2 R F L U2 B' R U' B2 U L D L2 D' F2 R2 F2 R' L U' R D B' U2 L' F' R2 D B' U2 L2 U B R`

Optimal scramble:

<ReconViewer
scramble="B U' L' U B2 R U' L D' L D' B F R' F R2 B' U"
solution={`U' B R2 F' R F' B' D L' D L' U R' B2 U' L U B'`}
/>

/>
<br />

### 10th Issue

In the 10th issue it was noted that several people had worked on a solution, but ultimately only one person submitted [^steenhuis-1985-2]. The suspicion was that the scramble was too long and that it led everyone to doubt whether they correctly applied each move. The competition was restarted with a new, shorter solution accompanied by images to help readers ensure that they correctly applied the scramble.

Original scramble translated: `R B L F (D' R)*6 (L B)*6 (U' F')*6`

Optimal scramble:

<ReconViewer
scramble="R' B' D2 U L' B D' B2 R' U' B2 R2 D B R D F' U'"
solution={`U F D' R' B' D' R2 B2 U R B2 D B' L U' D2 B R`}
/>

### 11th Issue

#### Solutions

In the 11th issue, four people submitted solutions to the scramble [^steenhuis-1985-3]. Analyzing the solutions and the Cubism For Fun leadership discussing among themselves, it was realized that attempting to strictly follow the steps of the CFOP style method promoted by Cubism For Fun often led to long solutions. This is because existing blocks that may be advantageous to preserve, can be broken during steps. Those who submitted attempted to preserve any grouped pieces by trying several solutions around those blocks. The four submissions are as follows:

**Hans van der Zijden (45 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="R' B' D2 U L' B D' B2 R' U' B2 R2 D B R D F' U'"
solution={`R' B' D F2 D L2 // Cross
R' D' R F L' D F' L // Two pairs
D' R D2 R2 D' R2 D R' D' R D2 R' // Last two pairs
F D F' D F D' L D' L' // CLL + ending cancel
D L D2 L' F' D' R' D2 R D2 // Cancel into ELL`}
/>

**Anneke Treep (34 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="R' B' D2 U L' B D' B2 R' U' B2 R2 D B R D F' U'"
solution={`L' U' L F D // Cross on F
F R' U B R U' F D' B' D B2 // F2L minus one corner
R B R' B2 R B R' // Last pair
U B U2 L' B' L B U2 B2 U' B2 // 1LLL`}
/>

**Klaas Steenhuis (30 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="R' B' D2 U L' B D' B2 R' U' B2 R2 D B R D F' U'"
solution={`U2 F2 R2 B' L2 D2 L2 B D' B' L2 // Form F2L blocks
R F' R' U' R' U R2 // Finish F2L minus two moves
F D F L D B D' R D' R' B' D' // Cancel into 1LLL`}
/>

**Guus Razoux Schultz (27 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="R' B' D2 U L' B D' B2 R' U' B2 R2 D B R D F' U'"
solution={`U F2 U' D R' B' L' F2 // XCross plus two corners
D2 R F D2 F' U D' R F R' U' R' // F2L
B D2 B' D' B D' B' // 1LLL`}
/>

#### New Scramble

A new scramble was provided in the 11th issue.

Original final scramble translated: `U R2 D L2 (U R F')*6 (B L2 U')*5 L' D2 R' U2`

Optimal final scramble:
<ReconViewer
scramble="B F' L2 B D2 L F' U' R2 U' F' D U L2 F' D2 U"
solution={`U' D2 F L2 U' D' F U R2 U F L' D2 B' L2 F B'`}
/>

/>

### 12th Issue

Although a new scramble was provided in the 11th issue, the competition was canceled in the 12th issue due to a lack of participants [^steenhuis-1986].

## Fewest Moves Challenge

### Early Discussions

In the early years of the Speed Solving Rubik's Cube Yahoo! group, some had shown an interest in solving a particular scramble in as few moves as possible. One standout example came in December 2002 when Lucas Winter suggested the idea of solving the same scramble multiple times to try to each time solve more quickly than the last, a solving style now called downsolving [^winter-2002]. In one reply, Lars Petrus described his experience, stating that in addition to the initial challenge he spent time trying to find the shortest solution to memorize before downsolving [^petrus-2002]. Petrus found a 32 move solution, stating the possibility of using optimal last layer solutions to reduce the overall solution to 26 moves. Impressed by the low move count, Jessica Fridrich replied to the message by Petrus [^fridrich-2002]. Fridrich sent the scramble to Mirek Goljan who found a 29 move solution.

### Challenge Creation

In April 2003, Dan Harris started a weekly competition called the Fewest Moves Challenge [^harris-2003-1] [^harris-2003-2]. The competition was moved to a new domain the next month [^harris-2003-3].

{ src: require("@site/docs/FewestMoves/img/Origin/HarrisAnnouncement2.png").default}
]}
/>
<br />

In March 2008 it was announced that the fewest moves challenge as held by Harris would be coming to an end [^harris-2008]. Per Kristen Fredlund took over control of the challenge, hosting it on a new domain [^fredlund-2008].

### Examples

The popularity of the Fewest Moves Challenge was likely a major reason for the event's inclusion in the World Championship 2003 and subsequently becoming a standard official competition event. Competitors in the challenge used a variety of methods, including speed methods such as CFOP, Petrus, Roux, and ZZ, as well as general blockbuilding and domino reduction. Below is a sample of some solutions.

**Frederick Badie (Line > F2L > LL, 27 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="F2 R' F2 U2 B2 R F2 D2 U2 L U2 R2 U' L' D' B L2 U R' D2 B2"
solution={`F' R' D F' // Line
U R2 L U2 // Two 1x2x2 blocks
L2 R' U R U' R' U' R U L' B' U2 B L // F2L
F' U2 F U F' U // OLL
B' U2 F B L R U2 L' R' U' // PLL`}
/>

**Gilles Roux (CEOR, 41 moves)**
<ReconViewer
scramble="B2 L2 F2 L B2 R2 F2 U' L2 R2 B' U2 B L2 U' D2 F' R2 F L2 R' B' L D2 U2"
solution={`U B R' B2 D2 // CPLine
R u2 R' u' r2 // DM
u R' u R2 u' R2 u U2 R' U R u // 2x2x3 + EO
U R U2 R2 U' R' U' R U2 R' // Right block
U' R U2 R' U' R U' R' U // 2GLL`}
