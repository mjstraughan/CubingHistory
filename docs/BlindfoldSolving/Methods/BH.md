## Description

**Creator:** [Daniel Beyer](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#beyer-daniel), [Chris Hardwick](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#hardwick-chris)

**Created:** 2009

**Steps:**

With UR and UBR as the buffer, solve pieces two at a time using move optimal 3-cycles.

## BH Development

In early 2008, Daniel Beyer and Chris Hardwick began mentioning the development of a new blindfold solving method [^hardwick-2008-1] [^beyer-2008-1] [^hardwick-2008-2] [^beyer-2008-2]. The idea was to take the freestyle 3-cycle solving that was growing in popularity and optimize the algorithms.

## BH Reveal

In 2008, Beyer added lists of algorithms to his website for solving the corners and edges [^beyer-nd-1] [^beyer-nd-2]. In March 2009, Hardwick posted a thread on SpeedSolving.com asking if there was interest in a complete website for the BH method [^hardwick-2009-1]. Seeing the large amount of interest from the forum members, Hardwick and Beyer began development on the website [^hardwick-nd]. A little over a month later, Hardwick posted the link to the page that covers the corner solving step of the method [^hardwick-2009-2]. This was soon followed by the edge solving page [^hardwick-2009-3]. Lucas Garron helped create links to applets for each case [^hardwick-2009-4].
